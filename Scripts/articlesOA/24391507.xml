Conversely, when STING activity was enhanced either by administering c-di-AMP during immunization or using a bacterial mutant that secretes elevated levels of c-di-AMP, mice failed to immunize and had decreased numbers of antigen-specific T cells following reinfection. This suppressive effect was largely due to the induction of type I IFNs since IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice immunized with either ActA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Lm-OVA in the presence of c-di-AMP or the <italic>tetR</italic> mutant were protected. Collectively, these findings suggest that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-induced STING activation reduces the host adaptive immune response by induction of type I IFN.</p><p>The mechanism of type I IFN-mediated inhibition of T cell priming remains unclear. We found that both WT and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells had significantly reduced expansion in the presence of c-di-AMP, suggesting that c-di-AMP-mediated suppression of lymphocyte priming is T cell extrinsic. One possibility is that the uptake of type I IFN-induced apoptotic cells by macrophages results in the release of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Carrero1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, mice administered c-di-AMP did not have detectable levels of IL-10 in the serum. Furthermore, similar to B6 mice, IL-10-deficient mice immunized in the presence of c-di-AMP were unable to elicit OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following challenge (<bold>data not shown</bold>). Thus, IL-10 is not the downstream effector of STING/type I IFN-mediated suppression of adaptive immunity in our model of protective immunity. Other mechanisms including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated T cell suppression, which is upregulated by type I IFN <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, may play a role in c-di-AMP-mediated inhibition of immunity. Indeed, Huang <italic>et al.</italic> found that splenic DCs from mice treated with DNA nanoparticles suppress <italic>ex vivo</italic> T cell proliferation in a STING- and IDO-dependent manner <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>While spleens from immunized STING-deficient mice contained fewer bacteria than B6 mice, bacterial clearance by immunized IRF3/7- and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice was even higher. One possibility is that there are STING-independent sources of type I IFNs in response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that MyD88/STING-deficient macrophages produced low levels of IFN-&#x003b2; eight hours post infection. Recent studies found that RIG-I-deficient cells had reduced IFN-&#x003b2; secretion in response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection suggesting that RNA from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can be detected by the host <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Abdullah1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Hagmann1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that immunized mice lacking MAVS, the signaling adaptor for RIG-I, were more protected than control mice upon reinfection (<bold>data not shown</bold>). Thus, RIG-I-dependent, STING-independent induction of type I IFNs via IRF3 and IRF7 may also contribute to the inhibition of protective immunity. Another possibility is that since na&#x000ef;ve IRF3/7- and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice exhibit heightened bacterial clearance compared to both na&#x000ef;ve B6 and STING-deficient mice, innate immune factors are also likely restricting reinfection. In fact, IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R-deficient mice have higher neutrophil recruitment in response to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1003861-BrzozaLewis1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Thus, careful examination of each mouse strain will be necessary to determine the extent of the contribution of innate versus adaptive immune mechanisms in protective immunity.</p><p>Type I IFN-mediated inhibition of immunity is unlikely specific to STING activation. Mice immunized in the presence of the poly(I&#x02236;C), which induces type I IFNs independently of STING, also lost the ability to restrict bacterial growth following challenge. Several studies have shown that administering poly(I&#x02236;C) prior to a protein antigen inhibits clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, supporting our findings that systemic type I IFN-induced inflammation reduces T cell priming <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Ngoi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The importance of type I IFNs during bacterial infection is less understood than for viruses <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Monroe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. For example, IFN-&#x003b2; is the highest upregulated gene following <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cytosolic invasion, yet mice lacking the IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R are more resistant to acute infection, suggesting that type I IFNs may promote pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Carrero1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Auerbuch1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-OConnell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, strains of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> that secrete elevated levels of c-di-AMP and induce higher levels of type I IFNs, are not hypervirulent <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, but induce considerably less T cell immunity as shown in this study. Thus it is possible that secretion of c-di-AMP and consequent type I IFN production may play a role in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> pathogenesis by suppressing the development of adaptive immunity. Although <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> generally causes acute infections, recent studies have found that type I IFNs promote chronic infections with LCMV by suppressing cell-mediated mechanisms of viral control <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Teijaro1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In the case of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, mice lacking IRF3 are more resistant to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> suggesting that IRF3 activation is detrimental to host clearance <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In humans, IFN-&#x003b1; treatment leads to higher incidences of TB reactivation <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Telesca1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, active TB patients exhibit an increase in type I IFN-inducible transcripts in the blood, which correlated with disease severity <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Therefore, type I IFNs may exacerbate or maintain secondary or long-term chronic infections. Interestingly, human STING often contains polymorphisms that makes it resistant to bacterial but not host derived CDNs <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Diner1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>STING-mediated suppression of protective immunity was not solely due to type I IFNs. Although protective immunity in <italic>tetR</italic>ActA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Lm-OVA-immunized mice was rescued in the absence of IRF3/7 and the IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R, mice immunized in the presence of c-di-AMP exhibited type I IFN-independent suppression. Since STING activates NF-&#x003ba;B as well as IRF3, it is possible that NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent inflammation also plays a role in restricting immunity. We believe that administering c-di-AMP activates STING more robustly compared to infection with the <italic>tetR</italic>ActA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Lm strain and thus inhibition of immunity by type I IFN-independent inflammation would become more apparent.</p><p>The results of this and other studies suggest an inverse relationship between the extent of inflammation and the development of adaptive immunity. For example, IL-12-deficient mice immunized with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> develop higher numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells and are more resistant to reinfection <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Pearce1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In previous studies, we found that a <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strain engineered to activate the inflammasome, and consequently induce high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, was a poor inducer of adaptive immunity <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Sauer2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, co-administration of heat-killed or LLO-deficient <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> blocked immunity to WT bacteria in a MyD88-dependent manner <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Bahjat2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Thus, activation of three distinct signaling pathways, STING, MyD88, and caspase-1 all resulted in the inhibition of the development of adaptive immunity. Therefore, there appears to be a dichotomy between innate immune pathways that are necessary for survival (for example, MyD88 for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and type I IFN for viruses), and those that lead to adaptive immunity. In fact, our data and work from others suggest that lack of inflammation represents an ideal environment for the generation of memory T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Condotta1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003861-Badovinac1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Indeed, mice deficient for both MyD88 and STING are fully immunized by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> even though there was a significant reduction of dendritic and T cell activation and cytokine production following immunization.</p><p>Considering that the innate immune response is believed to be required for the initiation of adaptive immunity, we were surprised that MyD88/STING-deficient mice immunized with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were protected after reinfection. This raises the question, which innate immune signaling pathways contribute to the initiation of T cell priming to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>? Previous work from our group found that NOD2 detects cytosolic <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003861-Leber1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, immunized MyD88/NOD1/2-deficient mice clear bacteria upon secondary lethal challenge (<bold>data not shown</bold>), suggesting that protective immunity is not due to redundancy between MyD88 and NOD-like signaling pathways. Future studies to identify which innate immune detection pathways are required for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-mediated CMI would provide a greater understanding of how pathogens and adjuvants elicit protective immunity, knowledge that can be used for the development and improvement of vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

<bold> reinfection.</bold> B6 mice were immunized with either 10<sup>3</sup> CFU &#x00394;<italic>actA</italic> in the presence (open triangles) or absence (open circles) of 50 &#x000b5;g poly(I&#x02236;C). Naive controls were administered sterile PBS (closed circles). Mice were challenged 30&#x02013;38 days post immunization with 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> CFU WT Lm-OVA and 3 days later CFU were enumerated in spleens and livers. The dashed line represents limit of detection. Data are presented as the cumulative results from 2 independent experiments (**p&#x0003c;0.005).</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1003861.s005.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank J.
