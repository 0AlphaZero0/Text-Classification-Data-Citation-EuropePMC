Over the last 20 years, tremendous progress has been made in TB vaccine research and development: from a pipeline virtually empty of new TB candidate vaccines in the early 1990s, to an era in which a dozen novel TB vaccine candidates have been and are being evaluated in human clinical trials. In addition, innovative approaches are being pursued to further improve existing vaccines, as well as discover new ones.

Tuberculosis (TB) is no exception. Most successful vaccines today target pathogens against which humoral immunity suffices to achieve protection and often sterile eradication. But TB vaccines need to drive primarily the cellular arm of the immune system. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</italic>), the intracellular pathogen that causes TB, was discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch (Nobel Laureate in 1905) and is responsible for more human deaths than any other single pathogen today <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The combination with HIV co-infection, which dramatically compromises host resistance to TB, leads to high disease prevalence in affected endemic populations. Currently, each year more than 1.5 million people die of TB, and more than 9 million newly develop TB <xref rid="ppat.1002607-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This dire situation is further compromised by the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <italic>Mtb</italic> strains <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Gandhi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and the more recent occurrence of TDR (totally drug-resistant) <italic>Mtb</italic> strains, which are virtually untreatable <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Velayati1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>TB, known also as the white plague, has been around for millennia. Early last century, hopes were that TB could be conquered by vaccination with the newly developed <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG vaccine, isolated by and named after Calmette and Gu&#x000e9;rin in Lille, France <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Calmette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These hopes were further boosted by the development of the first anti-tuberculous drugs during WWII by Selman Waksman (Nobel Laureate in 1952), who discovered that streptomycin was bacteriostatic for <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Waksman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Initially, treatment with streptomycin appeared highly efficacious, but the tide turned when drug resistance rapidly developed, an early testimony of <italic>Mtb</italic>'s ability to acquire drug resistance when treated by single antibiotics. Despite this early writing on the wall, the misconception that TB could be conquered by antibiotics and BCG vaccination led to complacency for several decades. This situation dramatically changed only in the early 1990s, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a global emergency. From that time onwards TB scientists, who had been focusing much of their efforts on other areas of research and development due to a lack of interest in and funding for TB, were able to reorient efforts and initiate significant activities in the study of TB <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kaufmann3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Soon, researchers determined <italic>Mtb</italic>'s genome sequence <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and began to dissect TB's immunology and cell biology.</p><p>Although in most cases, TB can be treated successfully with multidrug combinations of antibiotics (except for MDR-, XDR-, and TDR-TB), treating TB cases is clearly insufficient to interrupt disease transmission in highly endemic populations, because an active TB case will typically infect some 10 to 15 contacts <xref rid="ppat.1002607-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> per year. Better preventive measures that block <italic>Mtb</italic> transmission need to be developed, including vaccines that prevent establishment of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the susceptible human host (infection-blocking vaccines), or alternatively, vaccines that prevent progression of established infection towards active TB disease (disease-progression-blocking vaccines). The only available vaccine against TB today remains the almost one-century-old BCG. It is routinely administered to infants in many countries worldwide and provides significant protection against severe forms of TB, mostly disseminating and meningeal forms. However, the protective efficacy of BCG against pulmonary TB in adults is inconsistent and incomplete, and BCG vaccination campaigns have had little impact on the occurrence of pulmonary TB, which represents the transmissible form of this disease. It is still unclear why the protective effect of neonatal or early-age BCG vaccination often begins to wane in early adolescence, at least in TB-endemic areas, as will be discussed further below. Nevertheless, in a North American study, BCG's protective efficacy was found to last for over 50 years <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Aronson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, thus pointing to the importance of possible environmental modulators (co-infections, co-morbidity, nutrition, genetics, TB exposure intensity, etc.; see below). Another issue of concern that compromises BCG's utility is that infants with HIV have an increased risk of developing disseminated BCG-osis <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Hesseling1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, bearing similarities to individuals with genetic deficiencies in the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23/interferon-gamma (IFN&#x003b3;)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 pathway <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Vosse1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This implies that TB vaccines need to be developed that not only have a superior ability to induce protective immunity against TB, but also have a better safety profile compared to BCG <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Hesseling1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>There has been significant progress in TB research over the last 20 years. From a pipeline empty of new TB vaccine candidates in the early 1990s, more than 12 novel TB vaccine candidates now have been or are being evaluated in clinical trials in humans. Moreover, many new approaches and strategies are under evaluation for further improvement of these and other vaccines. This raises hope that vaccines can be developed which are better than BCG. It will be critical to mobilize the needed funding, political, and supranational support, and increase public awareness of the pressing needs in TB in order to step up efforts towards controlling this resilient disease. The recent declaration by the European Parliament to support TB vaccine research and development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tbvi.eu/news-agenda/news/news-message/eu-parlement-discusses-the-importance-of-tb-vaccines.html">http://www.tbvi.eu/news-agenda/news/news-message/eu-parlement-discusses-the-importance-of-tb-vaccines.html</ext-link>) is a laudable step in this direction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>TB Infection Control</title><p>Infection with <italic>Mtb</italic> does not necessarily lead to TB disease. Only 3&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; of immunocompetent individuals that are infected will progress towards active disease during their life-time <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It is unknown if&#x02014;and what proportion of&#x02014;infected individuals are able to possibly achieve complete or &#x0201c;sterile" eradication of bacteria following primary pulmonary infection. Existing yet indirect evidence suggests that this may be the case and could be dependent on innate rather than adaptive immune defense mechanisms, as persons have been described who despite high intensity exposure&#x02014;and thus likely infection&#x02014;remain tuberculin skin test (TST)-negative and do not develop disease <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Cobat1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The TST is a classical indicator of delayed type hypersensitivity-dependent T-cell activity towards <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens in the case of previous contact. TST surveys suggest that around one-third of the world's population, amounting for over 2.2 billion people, is infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002607-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although &#x0003e;90&#x00025; are able to contain infection in a latent or subclinical stage, this huge reservoir of latently infected individuals fuels the high numbers of new active TB cases <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Lillebaek1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The development of active TB is dramatically accelerated by co-infection with HIV, which increases <italic>Mtb</italic> reactivation rates from 3&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; per life-<italic>time</italic> to 5&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; per life-<italic>year</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Latent <italic>Mtb</italic> infection also poses iatrogenic clinical challenges, due to increases in TB reactivation following administration of biologicals, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x003b1;)/IL-12/IL-23 blockers in treating inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. New diagnostic tests that distinguish more specifically between <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and BCG vaccination or infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) than the classical TST have been developed recently, based on <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen-specific release of IFN&#x003b3; in whole blood or isolated leucocytes. These assays have been coined interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) and have utility in clinical management, although sensitivity issues in borderline IGRA-positive and in remotely infected persons, which may result in false-negative test results, still need to be addressed <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>A precise understanding of protective immunity and protective host defense is still needed. The study of individuals who are able to control <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in the long term may be particularly informative in this respect. Despite two decades of intensified research, we have to acknowledge that we still do not fully understand what exactly constitutes protective immunity and host defense against TB (see below section on TB immunology). If we could decipher essential mechanisms, pathways, and biomarkers of protection, then pathways of host defense could be targeted by rationally designed vaccines, and protection measured by accurate biomarkers <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Parida1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Mittrucker1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Obviously, TB is much more complex than, for example, many viral infections, in which highly pathogen-specific mechanisms and correlates of protection exist in the form of neutralizing antibodies. An additional challenge in TB is the need to do better than achieve natural immune control of long-term infection: notably, by inducing immune responses that not only mediate life-long control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (which poses the inherent risk of endogenous reactivation), but also achieve sterile eradication of bacteria from the infected host. First-generation new TB vaccines in clinical trials are designed to achieve stronger immunity but may not necessarily succeed at sterile eradication (discussed below) <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kaufmann4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Stop1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Besides mediating protection on its own, the host immune response is also known to synergize with chemotherapy through incompletely defined mechanisms <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus not only preventive, but also therapeutic, TB vaccines that improve the host response to chemotherapy will be of significance; the latter may help shortening treatment, as well as reducing and perhaps treating drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>
<italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG: The Current TB Vaccine</title><p>BCG is the one of the most widely administered vaccines worldwide, having been given over 4 billion times. BCG has been part of the expanded program on immunization (EPI) since the early 1970s and features relatively few serious adverse events. Only fairly recently has it become apparent that individuals with genetic defects in key immune genes or infants with clinically active HIV infection are highly susceptible to developing disseminating BCG disease, posing a significant risk in HIV-burdened populations where TB is often highly endemic <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Hesseling1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This has led to changes in policy from the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, recommending that BCG should not be used in HIV-positive children.</p><p>Despite the relative efficacy of BCG in infants, the major unanswered question is why BCG fails to prevent pulmonary TB in adolescents. It has been proposed that immune memory wanes in adolescence, which is the most critical period for TB infection and/or its progression to active disease. The fact that immunological memory is induced by BCG at an early age (neonates or infants) at which the immune system is not yet fully mature may provide one explanation. However, other factors may also contribute to decreasing BCG efficacy and/or enhanced susceptibility of young adults to TB. These factors include co-infections with helminths; viruses that compromise host immunity (an obvious, extreme example is HIV); and NTM that can induce immune regulation <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Helminth infection has been associated with increased TB incidence and reduced BCG vaccine efficacy in affected populations <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Hatherill1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Such modulatory effects may be mediated by immune deviation, e.g., the induction of T helper 2 (Th2) or regulatory T-cell (Treg) responses, which dampen the protective efficacy of Th1-dependent protection. A recent study in mice documented that helminth infection can impair innate pulmonary host defense against <italic>Mtb</italic> through the IL-4 receptor pathway <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Potian1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Whatever the explanation for its inadequacy, BCG is clearly insufficient for worldwide TB control. Thus, there is a strong need to develop vaccines that can either boost BCG's initial priming and protective effects, or replace BCG by superior vaccines. Both strategies and approaches will be discussed below, after a short introduction to the key immunological features of TB.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>The Immunology of TB</title><p>
<italic>Mtb</italic> organisms are transmitted by aerosols originating from the lungs of persons with active TB. <italic>Mtb</italic>-loaded aerosols are inhaled by TB contacts and reach the alveoli of their lungs, where they are taken up by various cell types, including alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, local dendritic cells (DCs), and likely also epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002607-g001">Figure 1:</xref> Infection). In humans and mice, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is followed by a delayed onset of adaptive immune responses when compared to other infections <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Urdahl1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recent studies in mice have shown that <italic>Mtb</italic> possesses the unique ability to establish infection while delaying the onset of an adaptive immune response by 2&#x02013;3 weeks. Using animals carrying genetically engineered T-cell receptors specific for <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens, it has been shown that priming of specific T-cell responses against <italic>Mtb</italic> takes place only in the local draining lymph nodes of the lung, and that transport of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cells from the lung parenchyma to the lymph nodes is significantly delayed for a period of at least 1&#x02013;2 weeks <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. It remains unknown which cell types are involved in <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen presentation to na&#x000ef;ve T-cells, either DCs that cross-present antigens from infected cells, or perhaps also DCs migrating from the lung <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Khader1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It is thought that <italic>Mtb</italic> can actively inhibit the migration of infected cells from the lung to the draining lymph nodes, or that <italic>Mtb</italic> can infect cells with only a poor migratory potential like epithelial cells. In both cases, however, initiation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell immunity is delayed. This &#x0201c;procrastination" strategy likely allows <italic>Mtb</italic> to establish infection and build up a critical mass of infecting organisms, from which two types of populations can be derived: (i) &#x0201c;dormant", &#x0201c;nonreplicating", or persisting organisms that remain in a metabolic low activity state in infected cells, and present a potential reservoir of bacteria that can resuscitate later on in life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002607-g001">Figure 1:</xref> Latency); and (ii) actively replicating metabolically active bacteria that stimulate the host immune response, which confers protection but can also precipitate TB pathology. The latter is hallmarked by the formation of central caseous necrotic lesions, filled with extracellular infectious <italic>Mtb</italic> and cell debris <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Reece1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1002607-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1002607.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The three stages of tuberculosis.</title><p>
<bold>Stage 1</bold>: Infection of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) frequently occurs at a young age. Metabolically active <italic>Mtb</italic> are inhaled and subsequently T-cells are stimulated which carry the major burden of acquired immunity. These include major histocompatability complex class II (MHC II)-restricted CD4 T-cells and MHC I-restricted CD8 T-cells. B cells are also activated but their protective role in TB remains elusive. Pre-exposure vaccines are given at this early stage. Novel pre-exposure vaccine candidates are given very soon after birth and thus generally before infection with <italic>Mtb</italic>. They either substitute for Bacille Calmette Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) or boost immunity induced by BCG. <bold>Stage 2</bold>: Acquired immunity comprising CD4 and CD8 T-cells contains <italic>Mtb</italic> in a dormant stage within solid granulomas. T-cells produce type I cytokines and cytolytic effector molecules. They become memory T-cells which concomitantly produce multiple cytokines. Individuals remain latently infected without clinical signs of active tuberculosis (TB). Post-exposure vaccines are given to adolescents or adults who are latently infected but healthy. <bold>Stage 3</bold>: Mechanisms leading to deficient immunity and disease reactivation are numerous and include production of suppressive cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#x003b2;) by T helper 2 (Th2) cells and regulatory T(reg) cells as well as T-cell exhaustion mediated by inhibitory receptor-coreceptor interactions on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T-cells. <italic>Mtb</italic> becomes metabolically active and granulomas become caseous. <italic>Mtb</italic> can be spread to other organs and to other individuals. Therapeutic vaccines are given to TB patients in adjunct to chemotherapy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1002607.g001"/></fig><p>
<italic>Mtb</italic> is able to persist inside otherwise hostile host cells, notably professional phagocytes, by employing different immune evasion strategies. These will not be discussed here in detail, but include the inhibition of phagosome maturation, the inhibition of autophagy, the inhibition of apoptosis, egression into the cytosol, blocking of MHC antigen processing and presentation, and the inhibition of IFN&#x003b3;-receptor signaling, all of which help <italic>Mtb</italic> to evade host defence <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Following initial deposition of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the lung, macrophages and other immune cells are recruited during the early innate response to infection. The resulting cellular infiltrates become organized as primary granulomas. These are highly dynamic structures from which cells can rapidly in- and efflux. At a later stage, when adaptive immunity has been initiated, specific T-lymphocytes start infiltrating the granuloma; this leads to the formation of larger, well-organized, solid granulomas in which <italic>Mtb</italic> organisms typically are located mostly centrally. If control of infection and inflammation is not balanced optimally, the central regions of the granulomas will become necrotic and later caseous as just discussed <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Dorhoi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, allowing outgrowth of high numbers of <italic>Mtb</italic> organisms. When these liquefying granulomas also damage airway linings, infected material is discharged into the airways. At this stage, TB infection has become contagious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002607-g001">Figure 1:</xref> Active TB disease).</p><p>Thus immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> is a two-edged sword: it protects the human host against disseminating infection, but also facilitates transmission of TB to contacts. Therefore, TB vaccines not only need to induce optimal immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic>, but also a balanced response that favors protective and avoids pathogenic mechanisms.</p><p>The <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immune response comprises a multitude of different cell types. This ranges from classical and non-classical T-cells to neutrophils, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. The role of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1-cells in TB is best understood. Th1-cells, which secrete IFN&#x003b3; and TNF as signature cytokines, are crucial for protective immunity against mycobacterial infections. Their induction is strictly dependent on the secretion of phagocyte-produced IL-12 <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Deleterious mutations in genes encoding proteins essential to the induction (IL-12p40 subunit, IL-12R&#x003b2;1) or function (IFN&#x003b3;R1, IFN&#x003b3;R2, Stat1) of Th1-cells, or their depletion due to HIV infection, greatly enhance susceptibility to severe infections due to otherwise poorly pathogenic mycobacteria or <italic>Mtb</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Casanova1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This is also highlighted by the enhanced incidence of TB reactivation during treatment with biologicals targeting TNF, which are used in treating inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1-cells recognize <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens presented by MHC-class II molecules on DCs and macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ladel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, the dominant habitats of <italic>Mtb</italic>. As mentioned above, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are initially primed in the draining lymph nodes of the infected lung. Endosomal/phagosomal antigens like <italic>Mtb</italic> naturally access the MHC-class II processing route, which leads to the presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptide-loaded MHC-class II complexes, providing &#x0201c;signal 1" at the DC surface. Only in the presence of a second signal, which is provided by co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80, CD86, CD40, CD27, and 4-1BB/CD137, and a third signal, provided by essential cytokines like IL-12, however, full activation and differentiation of Th1-cells takes place. In the absence of any of these three essential components, T-cell activation may either not be initiated, or be preliminarily aborted; e.g., in the absence of signal 2, T-cell tolerance/anergy can result. Recent studies suggest that T-cell activation in TB granulomas is far from optimal but the limiting factors, which may be antigen/MHC-class I/II availability, lack of co-stimulation, or lack of supportive cytokines, still need to be elucidated <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Egen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Next to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1-cells, more recent evidence supports the prominent activation of Th17-cells in TB. This is a recently discovered T-cell subset that produces IL-17A, IL-17F, in many cases IL-22 and TNF, and in some cases also IFN&#x003b3;. Th17-cells are pro-inflammatory and mediate anti-microbial immunity against extracellular bacteria and fungi, particularly at mucosal surfaces. The exact mechanisms leading to Th17 activation and differentiation are less clear than for Th1-cells but are believed to involve phagocyte-dependent production of IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-6, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#x003b2;). Other studies have pointed towards the essential role of IL-23, a closely related family member of IL-12, in the induction and expansion of Th17-cells or Th17 memory cells <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Sallusto1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

The mechanisms underlying CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell activation in TB are incompletely defined. It is clear that DCs possess multiple pathways to load MHC-class I molecules, either by classical cytosolic processing, or by alternative processing of phagosome-located pathogens and endosome-located antigens. Active transmembrane transport, or leakage through micro-damaged membranes of <italic>Mtb</italic> phagosomal antigens to the classical cytosolic proteasome/MHC-class I presentation pathway, may also lead to MHC-class I loading with <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides. The recent suggestion that virulent mycobacteria can escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm and thereby directly access MHC-class I processing/presentation may provide a new mechanism <xref rid="ppat.1002607-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Thirdly, <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cells can undergo apoptosis, leading to the formation of apoptotic vesicles that are taken up by DCs, after which the antigenic cargo is cross-presented through MHC-class I and class II molecules <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Schaible1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Winau1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.

Thus CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are able to survey larger numbers of cells and a broader range of cell types compared to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. In addition, as already mentioned above, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are able to survey the cytoplasmic compartment of infected cells for pathogen-derived peptides through various antigen processing/presentation routes. Thus CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell immunity offers clear advantages and complementarity to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell immunity.</p><p>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are able to secrete granules that contain cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and granulysin.

Recent genome-wide gene expression studies in TB patients revealed a striking neutrophil-associated expression pattern that was dominated by a type-1 interferon signaling signature. This profile normalized after curative treatment of infection, and had a core <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific component. Thus, other cells certainly contribute to host defense in TB, and may provide new biomarker signatures of pathogenesis, disease activity, and protective immunity.</p><p>Despite the more limited knowledge on the role of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells in TB compared to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells, paradoxically there seems to be greater consensus on &#x0201c;multifunctionality" as a marker of protection in TB for CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells than for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. Multi- or poly-functionality is a term used to describe the simultaneous production of multiple cytokines (mostly IFN&#x003b3;, IL-2, TNF) or the expression of multiple effector functions (perforin, granulysin, cytolysis, etc.) by one single T-cell clone. For example, the co-expression of IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2 by <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells was associated with protective host defense following curative TB treatment <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Caccamo1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Caccamo2" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Conversely, there is some controversy whether poly-functional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are associated with protection, or even with disease. Some reports, mostly derived from vaccination studies in animals, have suggested that poly-functional (IFN&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>TNF<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells are associated with protective immunity <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Darrah1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Derrick1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, but more recent studies have suggested that these cells may not indicate protection, and even mark TB disease activity <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Sutherland1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. This issue clearly needs further investigation. In this context, it needs to be realized that even during active TB disease not all lesions in the human lung are reactivating. At least some sites of infection are probably still controlled by the host immune response. Thus, much akin to recent new models that describe latent TB as a graded continuum of infection rather than as a single static entity <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, it is likely that TB disease follows a similar spectrum, ranging from the reactivation of only few lesions up to full-blown activation of many lesions such as seen in rapidly disseminating disease. It follows that in mild and less severe forms of TB, in which only part of lesions is reactive, others may be adequately controlled by the host response, which may involve multi-functional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells. In any case, further studies to resolve these controversies are eagerly awaited.</p><p>Besides T-cells endowed with protective effector functions, <italic>Mtb </italic> also induces activation and expansion of regulatory T-cell (Treg) populations. These range from naturally occurring, broadly reactive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Tregs, to antigen-specific-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Tregs <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Shafiani1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kursar1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref> and newly identified CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Tregs, which have been mostly identified in the human response to mycobacteria <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Joosten2" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Joosten3" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. These Treg have multiple inhibitory effects: they can directly suppress CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th-cell activity through secretion of IL-10, CCL4, or the expression of membrane-bound TGF&#x003b2;; they can deactivate APCs and thus inhibit optimal priming of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> responses; and they can inhibit the influx of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells into draining lymph nodes, and/or inhibit their proliferation and expansion <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Shafiani1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, thus delaying and inhibiting onset of adaptive immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>Thus a multitude of interlinking cells and mechanisms are involved in the immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, including activating/effector, and inhibitory/regulatory functions.

If it were possible to identify a correlate with the same potency as neutralizing antibodies against viruses, discovery of high profile TB vaccine candidates and clinical testing could be markedly accelerated.

The first aims at replacing BCG by either improved recombinant (r)BCG or by genetically attenuated <italic>Mtb</italic>. The profile of genetically improved rBCG should be: a) safer; b) more immunogenic; c) inducing longer lasting protection; and d) inducing protection against highly virulent clinical isolates such as <italic>Mtb</italic> Beijing strains, as well as MDR, XDR, and TDR <italic>Mtb</italic> strains. One way to improve BCG is either by introducing immunodominant <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antigens that are absent from BCG, such as RD1 locus-encoded antigens (ESAT6, CFP10); or by over-expressing antigens that BCG already expresses by itself (cognates of Ag85 complex), but probably not sufficiently high throughout all phases of infection. Another way to improve BCG is by introducing genetic modifications for superior targeting of essential immune pathways, for example, by enhancing or facilitating cross-priming; and to inhibit its ability to neutralize phagosomal maturation. Obviously, both strategies can be combined <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Reece1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Besides these two rBCG vaccine approaches, a second major strategy to develop better live vaccines against TB has been to attenuate <italic>Mtb</italic>. These strategies include the deletion of essential metabolic genes to create auxotrophic mutants; or the deletion of major virulence genes and their regulators (see below). In either case, at least two independent genetic loci need to be deleted to avoid reversion to virulence.

A recently published third type of live mycobacterial vaccine against TB is recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.

These are non-live, or in the case of viral vectors, non-replicating vaccines, which can be delivered safely into the human host regardless of immunocompetence. Subunit vaccines in TB are mostly based on recombinant proteins admixed with proper adjuvants, or the use of attenuated viral vectors. Although subunit vaccines theoretically could be used as priming vaccines, current views are that they may be mostly used as booster vaccines on top of BCG-, recombinant BCG-, or attenuated <italic>Mtb</italic>-priming vaccines. The subunit vaccines are then anticipated to boost strong, long-lived immune responses in already primed individuals, such that these will persist to levels high enough to protect the 3&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; vulnerable individuals against TB disease.</p><p>The various types of vaccines and their intended use are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002607-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1002607-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1002607.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Most advanced TB vaccine candidates in clinical trials.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="ppat-1002607-t001-1" xlink:href="ppat.1002607.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Candidate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical Trial Status</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recombinant BCG for pre-exposure prime vaccination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VPM 1002</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rBCG-expressing listeriolysin and urease deletion</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase IIa ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rBCG30</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rBCG-expressing Ag85B</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I completed/on hold</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aeras-422</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rBCG-expressing perfringolysin and Ag85A,85B, Rv3407</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I terminated due to side effects</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral-vector for pre-exposure booster vaccination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oxford MVA85A/Aeras-485</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Modified vaccinia Ankara-expressing Ag85A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase IIb ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crucell Ad35/Aeras-402</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Replication-deficient adenovirus 35-expressing Ag85A, Ag85B, TB10.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase IIb ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AdAg85A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Replication-deficient adenovirus 5-expressing Ag85A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion protein in adjuvant for pre-exposure booster vaccination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hybrid 1&#x0002b;IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion of Ag85B and ESAT-6 in adjuvant IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I, soon entering IIa</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hybrid 56&#x0002b;IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion of Ag85B, ESAT-6 and Rv2660c in adjuvant IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hybrid 1&#x0002b;CAF01</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion of Ag85B and ESAT-6 in adjuvant CAF01</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M72&#x0002b;AS01 or AS02</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion of Rv1196 and Rv0125 in adjuvant AS01 or ASO2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase IIa ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aeras-404: HyVac4&#x0002b;IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fusion of Ag85B and TB10.4 in adjuvant IC31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase I</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Whole bacterial vaccine for therapeutic vaccination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RUTI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detoxified <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in liposomes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phase IIa ongoing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

This vaccine resulted in improved protection against TB in guinea pigs, and appeared to be immunogenic in humans <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Hoft1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>.

The rBCG's profile indeed showed better immunogenicity, but this was compromised by its enhanced virulence in SCID mice. Thus, deleting the virulence determinants of this region may offer a viable strategy to improve immunity while maintaining safety. More recent studies engineered a recombinant BCG strain to over-express Ag85A, Ag85B, and TB10.4 <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. While appearing to be safe and to induce high levels of IFN&#x003b3;-producing T-cells in mice, its protective efficacy against TB was not improved substantially over wild-type BCG.</p><p>Another approach to improve BCG has been the expression of listeriolysin, while deleting expression of ureC in BCG <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Grode1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Listeriolysin is derived from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, the organism in which it is required for phagosomal escape and translocation to the cytosol of the infected cell. Listeriolysin likely perforates the phagosomal membrane, allowing leakage of enzymes (such as cathepsins and other proteases) and bacterial components into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Listeriolysin is only active at acidic pH 5.5 and is degraded immediately in the cytosol because this protein comprises a PEST sequence (i.e., a peptide sequence containing the amino acids proline [P], glutamic acid [E], serine [S], and threonine [T]), which induces its own degradation <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Decatur1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>. Hence, its activity is restricted to the phagosome. These features ensure safety of this construct. BCG normally expresses UreC, which is able to counteract phagosomal acidification; deletion of UreC from BCG prevents this, such that the resulting acidic pH of the BCG phagosome facilitates the activity of listeriolysin. The recombinant BCG lacking ureC and expressing listeriolysin caused superior protection as compared to parental BCG <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Grode1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Interestingly, rBCG&#x00394;Urec:Hly appeared to increase apoptosis of infected host cells, and the resulting apoptotic vesicles carrying vaccine components facilitated cross-priming by DCs, inducing strong CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses.

Recent work has revealed that <italic>Mtb</italic> alters its metabolic state from active replication to slow or non-replication during infection. This is accompanied by significant changes in <italic>Mtb</italic>'s gene expression profile. The resulting changes in protein expression also have an impact on which antigens are available to the immune system as a result of <italic>Mtb</italic>'s alterations in antigen expression when entering into starvation or dormancy.

<italic>Mtb</italic> itself is a master regulator of immune regulatory circuits. It induces strong CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Treg activity that suppresses Th1 and Th17 responses (see above). <italic>Mtb</italic> exploits these regulatory mechanisms, which are normally used to prevent excessive inflammatory responses and accompanying tissue damage. In addition, <italic>Mtb</italic> downregulates key pathways of protection such as apoptosis, autophagy, and IFN&#x003b3; production as well as IFN&#x003b3;R signaling. Of note, highly discriminative biomarkers upregulated in T lymphocytes from TB patients as compared to latently infected individuals comprise genes involved in inhibitory signaling <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>. The likely synergistic effects of blocking multiple pathways at multiple different levels, added to the delay in its transport from the lung to the lymph node and the ensuing delay in priming T-cell immunity, collectively create an environment in which <italic>Mtb</italic> can establish a safe niche of infection from which it can seed the human body with a new wave of bacteria whenever immune pressure is alleviated, for example, during co-infection or malnutrition. Thus, the challenge for new TB vaccines is not only to induce strong memory immune responses with long-term efficacy in &#x0201c;clean animal laboratory settings", but also to do so in the face of the highly complex environmental, co-infection, and immunoregulatory background of the vulnerable human host.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Therapeutic Vaccines</title><p>New TB vaccines should not only induce immune responses that control existing or new infections at the latent stage, but ideally also eradicate <italic>Mtb</italic> organisms from the human body and achieve sterile eradication <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kaufmann4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This would avoid the threat of TB reactivation from latency that can occur decades after initial infection. Such vaccines must also operate in the huge reservoir of latently infected individuals.

Only very few bacilli are thought to reach the lung and establish the primary complex. Theoretically, the availability of mucosal antibodies at the site of infection could be valuable.

<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Maglione1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. What is the potential role of such antibodies? First, they could target <italic>Mtb</italic> to macrophages for destruction, e.g., through Fc&#x003b3;R pathway activation.

Second, they might exert chemotactic functions and attract additional immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells to the site of infection. And third, by targeting <italic>Mtb</italic> to Fc receptors, antibodies might promote activation and antigen processing/presentation by DCs and macrophages and promote microbicidal activity in these cells <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Geissmann1" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Schuurhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>.</p><p>Other TB vaccination strategies should address the targeting of the mucosal immune system. Much research is focusing on the potential of mucosal immunity and its enhancement by local vaccine delivery. Recent studies documented that pulmonary aerosol delivery of BCG or subunit vaccines in animal models was highly effective in inducing rapid immunity at the site of infection <xref rid="ppat.1002607-GarciaContreras1" ref-type="bibr">[141]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Tchilian1" ref-type="bibr">[144]</xref>.

Even though such cells are unlikely to prevent TB infection <italic>stricto sensu</italic>, their rapid early response is likely to contribute to early control of infection, particularly because these cells may respond to infection during a critical period in which <italic>Mtb</italic> delays onset of adaptive immunity as discussed above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>In striking contrast to only 10 years ago, the TB vaccine candidate pipeline is now filled with a number of high-profile candidates, some of which have already entered or are soon likely to enter clinical trials. First immunogenicity profiles of vaccines tested in humans look encouraging. Because we do not know the mechanisms of protection against TB and are lacking surrogate end-point biomarkers of protection, we cannot predict whether these vaccines will have protective efficacy in humans. Nevertheless, many of these vaccine candidates have proven records in animal models, ranging from mice to guinea pigs to non-human primates, raising hopes they may also be protective in humans. Vaccines may be used either as stand-alone vaccines or&#x02014;more likely&#x02014;in heterologous prime-boost settings.</p><p>The next 10&#x02013;15 years will be critical for TB vaccines to demonstrate protective efficacy as well as safety. At the same time, it must be realized that these first-generation vaccines are neither designed to prevent infection nor to achieve sterile eradication, but rather to better prime and/or boost infection control. Thus at best, such vaccines will only inhibit or delay TB reactivation. Next-generation vaccines should be designed aiming at preventing infection or achieving sterile eradication, perhaps by redirecting immune responses at <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens expressed during latency <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Leyten1" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1002607-Schuck1" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Aagaard1" ref-type="bibr">[130]</xref> or by using new platforms <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Sweeney1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. The new vaccines, especially subunit vaccines, most likely will need to be administered multiple times in order to maintain adequate life-long immune memory. Virtually nothing is known about the timing of such boosting schedules when it comes to vaccines aimed at inducing primarily cellular immunity. Finally, the impact of co-infection, immune regulation, and environmental factors (nutrition; type-2 diabetes) that enhance susceptibility to developing TB disease remain ill-defined, and need further research.</p><p>In summary, there is reason for optimism in the field of TB vaccines: there is a substantial portfolio of interesting TB vaccine candidates in clinical phase-I/II testing, some of which are already fairly advanced in the TB vaccine pipeline. This is complemented by numerous promising candidates further upstream in the pipeline. In fact, an emerging bottleneck may not be the number of pre-clinical TB vaccine candidates that TB researchers can produce, but rather the number of vaccines that can be tested clinically in efficacy trials, given the limited clinical trial capacity worldwide, i.e., a shortage that exists not only in Africa but also in Asia <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002607-Kaufmann2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.
