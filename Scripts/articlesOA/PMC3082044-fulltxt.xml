In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the highly resistant variety, Kasalath, and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare. Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, designated <italic>qSTV7</italic> and <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respectively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11 under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> was validated using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines. Fine mapping of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> was carried out using 372 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2:3</sub> recombinants and 399 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>3:4</sub> lines selected from 7,018 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plants of the cross SL-234/Koshihikari. The <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> was localized to a 39.2&#x000a0;kb region containing seven annotated genes. The most likely candidate gene, LOC_Os11g30910, is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein. The predicted protein encoded by the Kasalath allele differs from Nipponbare by a single amino acid substitution and the deletion of two amino acids within the sulfotransferase domain. Marker-resistance association analysis revealed that the markers L104-155&#x000a0;bp and R48-194&#x000a0;bp were highly correlated with RSV resistance in the 148 landrace varieties. These results provide a basis for the cloning of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>, and the markers may be used for molecular breeding of RSV resistant rice varieties.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00122-011-1557-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice stripe disease, one of the most serious viral diseases in the temperate regions of East Asia, is caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), which is transmitted by small brown plant hopper (SBPH, <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> Fallen). The spread of this disease has resulted in severe losses in <italic>japonica</italic> rice production in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Area of China since 2000 (S&#x0014d;gawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>; Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). Currently, the most common control measure is the application of pesticides that target the SBPH vector, which is costly and harmful to the environment. Development of resistant varieties offers a more economical, efficient and environmentally safe way to control this disease.</p><p>Resistance to RSV has been studied in Japanese upland rice varieties and two loci, <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>a</italic> and <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>b</italic>, have been reported (Washio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1968a</xref>). <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>a</italic> and <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>b</italic> are complementary dominant genes. The former was linked with the glutinous endosperm (<italic>wx</italic>) and <italic>photosensitivity</italic>-<italic>1</italic> (<italic>Se</italic>-<italic>1</italic>) loci on chromosome 6, and the latter was located on chromosome 11. Some <italic>indica</italic> paddy varieties, including the Pakistani <italic>indica</italic> paddy variety, Modan, have a different resistance allele <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic>, which is incompletely dominant and allelic with <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>b</italic> on chromosome 11 (Washio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1968b</xref>). In the 1960s, <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic> from Modan was introduced into many <italic>japonica</italic> varieties, including St. No. 1, Chugoku 31, Aichi 6 and Aichi 97 for the control of RSV (Toriyama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1966</xref>; Maeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). Thereafter, the derivative varieties harboring <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic> were widely cultivated in Japan and in the Jiangsu province of China, and showed a stable resistance to RSV (Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). However, varieties with a single resistance gene are at an increased risk of their resistance being overcome by new strains of the virus. It is thus necessary to discover new genetic resources for resistance to RSV for use in rice breeding programs.</p><p>The <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic> gene in Modan was preliminarily localized to a 1.8-cM segment on chromosome 11 using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers (Hayano-Saito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>), and then finely mapped to a 286&#x000a0;kb region covered by two overlapping BAC clones (Hayano-Saito et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>). In the Korean <italic>indica</italic> variety Milyang 23, one QTL for RSV resistance was detected in the interval between markers XNpb202 and C1172 on chromosome 11 (Maeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>), which was reported to be allelic with <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic>. Subsequently, the same research group using both RFLP and SSR markers reported two QTLs in the Japanese upland rice variety, Kanto 72. The QTL on chromosome 11 corresponding to <italic>Stv</italic>-<italic>b</italic> exerted a greater effect than the other on chromosome 2 by reducing the infection rate of RSV (Maeda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>). In the <italic>indica</italic> variety, DV85, Ding et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>) also detected two major QTLs for RSV resistance. One was mapped to the same chromosomal region as <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic>, and the other was mapped on chromosome 7. More recently, three QTLs were detected in the Indian landrace Dular, one on chromosome 3 and the other two in the RM287&#x02013;RM209 and RM209&#x02013;RM21 intervals on chromosome 11, respectively (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2009</xref>). All these studies indicate the presence of a single resistance gene or gene cluster against RSV on chromosome 11. In addition, most of previous studies on QTL detection for RSV resistance used RFLP molecular markers, which are tedious and costly, and difficult to use for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Recently, Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>) reported the fine mapping of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>TQ</italic></sup> to a 55.7&#x000a0;kb interval, which based on pedigree and physical mapping appears to be <italic>Stvb</italic>-<italic>i</italic> or an allele.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to identify QTLs for RSV resistance from the resistant rice variety Kasalath and to develop PCR-based molecular markers for fine mapping and marker-assisted selection of any major QTLs detected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The varieties IR36 (<italic>indica</italic>) and Wuyujing #3 (<italic>japonica</italic>) were used as resistant and susceptible controls, respectively. A total of 314 rice accessions (299 landraces and 15 commercial varieties from Japan, Korea, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and China) were screened for resistance to RSV. Of these, 148 landraces with different levels of resistance were selected for marker-trait association analysis (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;1).</p><p>Ninety-eight backcross inbred lines (BILs, BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>8</sub>), derived by single seed descent from the cross Nipponbare/Kasalath//Nipponbare (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>), were used to detect QTL for RSV resistance. These BILs were genotyped using 245 RFLP markers distributed along the 12 rice chromosomes. A panel of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) was generated in Koshihikari genetic background by first selecting 49 lines from BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>3</sub> plants of Koshihikari/Kasalath//Koshihikari in which a single large chromosome segment of Kasalath was introduced to the genetic background and then back-crossing with the recurrent parent Koshihikari to the BC<sub>3</sub> generation without selection. A whole-genome survey, based on 129 RFLP loci, was used to select 39 CSSLs, designated from SL-201 to SL-239. Except for a small region on the short arm of chromosome 8 and the long arm of chromosome 12, the whole Kasalath genome is represented within the CSSL set.</p><p>The populations and lines used for fine mapping are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For rough mapping of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>, a small secondary F<sub>2</sub> population (BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) consisting of 286 plants was obtained by self-pollinating the BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants generated from the cross SL-234/Koshihikari and grown in a paddy field in Jiangsu Province, China, in the summer of 2006. Artificial inoculations of these 286 F<sub>2:3</sub> lines were done in the greenhouse in September 2006. For the subsequent fine mapping, 5,518 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plants (Population I) were grown in Lingshui County, Hainan Province, China in 2006 and another 1,500 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plants (Population II) in Nanjing in 2007. All 7,018 plants were genotyped using two molecular markers flanking the <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> locus and the recombinants were selected for evaluation of RSV resistance. Three hundred and seventy-two BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2:3</sub> recombinant lines and their derived 372 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>3:4</sub> lines selected from Population I were used for evaluating and validating RSV resistance, respectively. In addition, 27 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>3:4</sub> recombinant families (each including ten lines) derived from Population II were used to further narrow the interval harboring <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>.

The field trial was done at Louzhuang town of Jiangyan city, Jiangsu Province, China, where a serious RSV epidemic has taken place since 2000. The seeds were sown in early May 2004, and the weather was most favorable for natural infection when the incidence of rice stripe disease was evaluated at about 50&#x000a0;days after seed sowing. Field trials were conducted in randomized complete blocks with three replicates. Plots consisted of single 18&#x000a0;cm rows of 50 plants with 10&#x000a0;cm spacing between rows. No pesticide was used during the entire growth period. The percentage of virus-containing SBPH in the fields was estimated to be 39% in 2004, 27% in 2007 and 29% in 2008, respectively, as determined by the random sampling and ELISA analysis (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>).</p><p>Phenotypic evaluation of BILs, CSSLs and populations for rough and fine mapping were conducted using artificial inoculation in greenhouse according to Sakurai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1963</xref>) with some modifications. Thirty germinated seeds of each line were sown in plastic dishes filled with soil; the weak seedlings were eliminated at the one-leaf stage, and 25 healthy seedlings of each line were kept for inoculation. When the seedlings were at the one-and-half-leaf stage, SBPH nymphs of first to second instars were released into the dish covered with plastic cylinder at a density of about five SBPHs per seedling. During inoculation period<italic>,</italic> the SBPHs in each dish were disturbed with a small soft brush every day to avoid aggregation. Three days later, all SBPH nymphs were killed with pesticide and seedlings were transferred to a greenhouse, where they grew for about a month until symptoms were observed. The experiments were performed with four replications. The percentage of virus-laden SBPH used in artificial inoculation was estimated to be 31% in 2006, 27% in 2007, 35% in 2008, and 41% in 2009, respectively.</p><p>Seedlings were evaluated and grouped into six classes (A, B, Bt, Cr, C and D) based on the severity of the RSV symptoms observed.

Four of these five putative genes (LOC_Os11g30930, LOC_Os11g30940, LOC_Os11g30950, and LOC_Os11g30960) are classified as encoding hypothetical or retrotransposon proteins (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). LOC_Os11g30910 is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein with one unique exon and a transcript length of 1,131&#x000a0;bp.

One results in an amino acid substitution (serine to threonine at position 214) and the other involves the deletion of tandem alanines (positions 224 and 225) in the Kasalath protein.

Natural variation arising from early landraces has played a vital role in the breeding of resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. For example, the rice <italic>Bph</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene originated from a Sri Lanka landrace, Mudgo, which subsequently was used as a parent of many of the commercial resistant varieties (S&#x0014d;gawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1982</xref>). Here we identified 68 highly resistant accessions by screening landraces collected from different regions, thus providing germplasm for RSV resistance breeding.

Among the resistant accessions, the Indian landrace Kasalath was highly resistant and found to harbor a major QTL for RSV resistance, <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>. The association between markers tightly linked with <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> and RSV resistance in diverse landraces (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) suggests gene introgression among different landraces during evolution and domestication to withstand a common stress.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title><italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> resides in a resistance gene cluster on chromosome 11</title><p>The QTLs detected in this study showed some difference under the natural and artificial inoculation.

The detection of distinct QTL using different inoculation methods might reflect the fact that artificial inoculation caused more disease symptoms after RSV infection, thus resulting in more QTLs detected.

Acceptor molecules include a wide array of substances, from endogenous molecules, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and peptides, to exogenous chemicals such as drugs, xenobiotics, and toxins. Sulfonation of small molecules can either activate or inactivate biological responses. There are two classes of SULTs: cytosolic and membrane-associated SULTs (see review by Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Sebasti&#x000e0; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, functional genomic approaches led to the characterization of brassinosteroid, hydroxyjasmonate, desulfoglucosinolate and flavonoid SULTs (Blanchard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>).</p><p>The biological functions of SULTs are still largely unknown, but plant sulfotransferase complexes and their resulting reactive products are believed to play a role in response to pathogens and the pathogen-related signals, such as methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid (Lacomme and Roby<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>). In some plants, sulfotransferase genes could be induced by pathogen-challenge or herbivore-attack (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>; Reymond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>). Recently, Baek et al.

In rice, the sulfonation of the tyrosine residues in phytosulfokine-&#x003b1; through a membrane-bound SULT was important for plant cell proliferation (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1999</xref>), which is consistent with a possible role in the stunting and withering phenotypes observed after infecting with RSV in this study.</p><p>To date, the structures of some SULTs have been solved. They share a common globular structure and contain a single &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; fold with a central four- or five-stranded parallel &#x003b2; sheet surrounded by &#x003b1;-helices.

The SULTs catalytic activity and substrate specificity were affected by PAPS binding site, substrate binding region, dimerization motif, and so on. A great deal of information on the catalytic mechanism of SULTs has been derived from the solved crystal structures and from the results of numerous site-directed mutagenesis studies (Marsolais and Varin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1998</xref>; Chapman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). Even a conservative replacement of the lysine with arginine in the sulfotransferase coding region led to a significant reduction in catalytic efficiency (Marsolais and Varin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1995</xref>). Analysis of the amino acids of the proteins predicted to be encoded by LOC_Os11g30910 in Nipponbare (susceptible) and Kasalath (resistant) revealed that the Kasalath protein contains one amino acid substitution (serine to threonine) and two amino acid deletions (alanine-alanine) in the sulfotransferase domain-containing region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The amino acid differences predicted by the Kasalath coding region of LOC_Os11g30910 may affect sulfotransferase structure resulting in functional differences that account for the difference in response to RSV between Kasalath and Nipponbare.</p><p>Because the identification of <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> candidate genes was based on annotation of the RSV susceptible Nipponbare, it is possible that there are other genes at the locus in the resistant cultivar Kasalath and sequencing of the Kasalath locus is being performed. To definitively identify the gene underlying <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup>, functional complementation tests with LOC_Os11g30910 from Kasalath and the other candidates at the <italic>qSTV11</italic><sup><italic>KAS</italic></sup> locus are currently underway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e3102" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
