Annotation of newly sequenced genomes requires a variety of experimental and computational methods [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as well as integration of diverse biological information from multiple sources. Annotations stemming from information integration can be potentially used as a powerful approach in functional genomics that facilitates downstream experiments [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Data warehouses based on integrated information [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are particularly useful as they open the possibility to explore content based on queries from diverse annotation attributes (e.g. genes, proteins, families, protein domains, ontologies, pathways). InterMine [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is one of the frameworks that allows construction of such data warehouses. It has previously been applied to developing data warehouses of model genomes resulting in resources such as FlyMine, modMine, RatMine, YeastMine, etc. For more details on InterMine features and comparison to similar systems, see reference [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and its supplementary materials.</p><p>Here, we introduce INDIGO (<underline>In</underline>tegrated <underline>D</underline>ata Warehouse of M<underline>i</underline>crobial <underline>G</underline>en<underline>o</underline>mes), a data warehouse for microbial genomes we developed, which allows integration of annotations for exploration and analysis of microbial genomes. Currently, INDIGO contains information from three species: two bacterial species, <italic>Salinisphaera shabanensis</italic> [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and <italic>Haloplasma contractile</italic> [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and one archaeal species, <italic>Halorhabdus tiamatea</italic> [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], all isolated from deep-sea anoxic brine lakes of the Red Sea. INDIGO will be regularly updated and expanded by addition of new microbial genomes from Red Sea species. </p><p>Our contributions in this study can be summarized as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Introduction of our Automatic Annotation of Microbial Genomes (AAMG). </p></list-item><list-item><p>Automation of data warehouse development in a high throughput manner that minimizes the intermediate steps for processing of annotation results. </p></list-item><list-item><p>Provision to public annotations of microbial genomes being sequenced at KAUST from studies of the Red Sea environment.

In order to help research on microbial genomes, a number of microbial data warehouses have been developed. A few examples are Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], MicrobesOnline [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Ensemble Genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensemblgenomes.org">www.ensemblgenomes.org</ext-link>) and MicroScope [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These publicly available data warehouses that contain microbial genomes information allow data browsing and comparison of genomes based on different sequence and functional features. On the other hand, these data warehouses are quite limited in capacity of query building and customized feature/attribute/entity list generation for more specific interrogation of information they contain.</p><p>We developed INDIGO, a data warehouse for microbial genomes using the InterMine framework Smith et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that allows extensive query building, customized feature/attribute/entity list creation and enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) concepts, protein domains and various pathways. In order to populate INDIGO with information from a newly sequenced genome, one needs a draft or complete genome assembly and functionally annotated the assembled genome. The INDIGO deployment requires the following five functions, namely, 1/ definition of a genomic data model of entities to be stored, 2/ data validation and population of the Postgres database, 3/ data integration, 4/ data post-processing, and 5/ web-application development. These five functions are synchronized through a project xml file that stores the location of different datasets, type of data sources and standard InterMine post-processing steps. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Genome assembly</title><p>In our case, we reassembled previously reported [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], three genomes based on the NGS-generated data available from Roche and Illumina sequencers and using Roche 454 Newbler assembler (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensemblgenomes.org">www.454.com</ext-link>) with scaffolding option turned on in addition to using SOAPdenovo [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Velvet [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, we use CISA [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to obtain consensus assemblies. We improved the resulting scaffolds using SSPACE [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], GapFiller [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and GapCloser [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Applying this procedure significantly improved the assemblies by reducing the number of contigs, improved N50 parameter of all three genomes. Consequently, the redundancy in the contigs observed previously using minimus [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is now resolved. These re-assembled contigs and associated annotations are deposited to NCBI with accession numbers <underline>AFNU00000000</underline>, <underline>AFNV00000000</underline> and <underline>AFNT00000000</underline> for HLPCO, SSPSH and HLRTI strains, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Genome annotation</title><p>In our study, we performed genome annotation through a series of steps described in a workflow depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082210-g001">Figure 1</xref>. First, genomic sequences are passed through fastaclean (Exonerate package) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Before the prediction of coding regions, the genome is masked for RNA using RNAmmer [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]and tRNAscanSE [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Predicted 16S rRNA genes are searched for in the NCBI prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene database to retrieve related taxonomic information that is later used in selecting the best BLAST hits. Open Reading Frame (ORF) prediction is performed using Prodigal [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], GeneMark [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and MetageneAnnotator [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A series of BLAST [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] searches are then performed against the GenBank non-redundant (nr) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], UniProt [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) databases including Reverse Position Specific (RPS) [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] searches against Conserved Domain Databases (especially COG and Prokaryotic Protein Clusters (PRK)). KEGG ortholog IDs are used to map relevant pathways and to display their presence on KEGG pathway maps. Interproscan analysis is carried out for GO terms and protein signature domains [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A check for annotation results is carried out using NCBI&#x02019;s tbl2asn and errors are manually corrected. To verify origin of each contig/genomic sequence, a global scan of BLAST results of all genes is carried out and Globally Best Taxonomies (GBT) are assigned based on species from high to low ranked top hits. Ties are broken based on the higher to lower total length of alignment reported in BLAST results by each of the top scoring species.</p><fig id="pone-0082210-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082210.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Workflow of annotation process and data warehousing.</title><p>Here, the section marked (A) shows steps in the annotation process.

InterMine is also included in the comparison to show what are the differences between its basic framework and our INDIGO system. This comparison clearly shows the advantages of the INDIGO system complementing InterMine and providing more control to the user in integrating annotation information that is lacking in other microbial data warehouses. MicroScope microbial genome annotations data warehouse differs from INDIGO by providing a scope for manual annotation for each and every gene individually. However, it thus requires a lot of expert manpower to deal with increasing amount newly sequenced microbial genome data. MicroScope also has a number of similar features to INDIGO, but InterMine-based INDIGO system takes lead in providing several automated and powerful routes for user-defined data integration, particularly keyword, query builder or BLAST based user-controlled gene lists making, which lead to statistically robust GO, pathway or protein domain enrichment analyses.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0082210-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082210.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>A comparison of features from different microbial data warehouses.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellpadding="2"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">INDIGO</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">InterMine</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Integrated Microbial Genomes</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microbes Online</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">MicroScope</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

We extend this core genomic model to fit our needs so as to cater to all types of annotations we receive from our annotation process. This includes data types and relationships between entities to be stored, such as attributes for organism, contigs, genes, CDS, protein domains, pathways and cross references. An example of genomic data model is provided in the materials at the website.</p></sec><sec id="s3.2"><title>Data validation and population of the Postgres database</title><p>InterMine provides a built-in setup for complex data integration, post-processing and web-application development. Data integration is heavily dependent on genomic model defined with data types and relationships between entities to be stored. Once a genomic model is defined, one can perform a check for the annotation that is to be loaded into the database. Our system first validates the annotation in reference to the defined genomic model using InterMine&#x02019;s Model and Document Perl Modules. It then prepares an xml schema filled with data that is ready to be loaded to the backend Postgres database. InterMine loads data into the database using pre-defined &#x02018;sources&#x02019; for different types of data packed in different formats. For example, to load genes data packed in the gff format, a Java-based data converter is available, but it assumes specific tags and fields. For customized data loading we developed prokaryotic-annots-xml, available as Supplementary material here, which allows loading of our validated annotations packed in xml format. InterMine&#x02019;s build-db setup reads the generated annotation using prokaryotic-annots-xml source and loads the data by defining and populating different annotation tables automatically. </p></sec><sec id="s3.3"><title>Data integration, post-processing and web-application development</title><p>Data integration in the InterMine&#x02019;s framework is a crucial step. It integrates data from sources provided in the project xml file and performs multiple checks (e.g. the absence of empty fields, the absence of duplicate data being stored, etc.). We only provide database identifiers in the annotation xml, for example, for GO or Interpro protein domains (IprD), and InterMine system integrates corresponding detailed annotations from complete GO or IprD source files defined in the project xml. </p><p>There are several built-in post-processing steps available in the InterMine framework such as create-search-index, transfer-sequences, etc., that allow for quick indexing of the data. For INDIGO, in order to have all the functionality available, we run all post-processing steps. <xref rid="pone-0082210-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows different stages in our data warehouse development along with the processing time using InterMine framework.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0082210-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082210.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Data warehouse development stages using InterMine.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">

For example, report pages for genome features such as genes, proteins, domains, and pathways are customized according to the data available including hyperlinks to external databases. One of the interesting external links allows for displaying KEGG pathway diagrams showing presence of the KEGG Ortholog ids to which the explored genome is mapped. Such a display shows which elements of the reference pathways are present or missing from the genome being examined. InterMine allows packaging of the web-application as a Web Application Archive or WAR-file that is then deployed on the Tomcat Apache server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tomcat.apache.org"><underline>http://tomcat.apache.org</underline></ext-link>). </p></sec><sec id="s3.4"><title>INDIGO Web Interface Organization</title><p>INDIGO is equipped with a number of features that allow for the exploration and analysis of the deposited information.

The &#x02018;Template&#x02019; tab shows all predefined templates to perform queries such as Organism-&#x0003e;Protein which help to obtain all proteins in a genome. The &#x02018;Lists&#x02019; tab provides access of all feature types; for example, selecting a feature type such as gene, protein, protein domain, etc. and providing a list of identifiers, makes a list of items with default attributes that can be saved or further analyzed. The &#x02018;QueryBuilder&#x02019; tab provides the most exhaustive functionality for building queries in INDIGO and it provides more control to include (show option) or limit (constrain option) for different feature types and their attributes. &#x02018;Regions&#x02019; tab provides access to all features present in a given genomic coordinate range. &#x02018;Data&#x02019; tab provides general information about the genomic data sets included in the data warehouse, e.g. genome assembly statistics, counts and links to contigs, ORF sequences, archaeal/bacterial genome completeness statistics based on counts of archaeal/bacterial core COGs [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], minpath-based [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] KEGG pathway association statistics, etc. API provides details on how to access data warehouse using PERL, Python, Ruby and Java programming languages.

This data warehouse of Red Sea microorganisms currently contains information about three genomes (two bacterial and one archaeal). Considering the unique biodiversity present in the Red Sea, KAUST has undertaken a large sequencing effort starting from metagenomes to cultured and uncultured single cell amplified genomes. The plethora of sequencing data produced requires a high throughput assembly, annotation and data warehousing pipelines. This work shows the basic framework through which these pipelines can be used in a high throughput manner to properly warehouse the increasing amount of data for targeted studies. Additional genomes will include both, genomes of pelagic bacteria and archaea, as well as more extremophiles from the brine pools of the Red Sea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors thank Julie Sullivan, Alex Kalderimis and intermine.org team for their help in understanding the Intermine system.
