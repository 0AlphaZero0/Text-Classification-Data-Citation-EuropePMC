Rotigotine is indicated for the treatment of early and advanced-stage Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug may vary between subjects of different ethnic origin. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single-dose treatment with rotigotine transdermal patch in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this open-label, parallel-group study, healthy male and female subjects of Japanese or Caucasian ethnic origin were matched by sex, body mass index, and age. A single transdermal patch delivering 2&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;h rotigotine (patch content 4.5&#x000a0;mg) was applied to the ventral/lateral abdomen for 24&#x000a0;h. The main outcome measures were the plasma concentrations of unconjugated and total rotigotine and its desalkyl metabolites and derived pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration [AUC<sub>last</sub>], maximum plasma concentration [<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>], and body weight- and dose-normalized values).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The pharmacokinetic analysis included 48 subjects (24 Japanese, 24 Caucasian). The mean apparent dose of rotigotine was 2.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;mg for Japanese subjects and 2.08&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.58&#x000a0;mg for Caucasians. Plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles of unconjugated rotigotine and of the main metabolites were similar for both ethnic groups. Parameters of model-independent pharmacokinetics, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, time to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), and AUC<sub>last</sub>, for unconjugated rotigotine showed no statistically significant differences between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Values of concentration-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were higher in female subjects; this difference was minimized after correction for body weight. A statistically significant difference between ethnic groups was observed for total rotigotine concentrations (total rotigotine&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;unconjugated rotigotine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;conjugated rotigotine), with slightly lower values in Caucasians after correction for body weight and apparent dose. No relevant differences were observed between males and females. Inter-individual variability was high. The terminal half-life for unconjugated rotigotine was 5.3&#x000a0;h in Japanese subjects and 5.7&#x000a0;h in Caucasians; corresponding values for total rotigotine were 8.6&#x000a0;h and 9.6&#x000a0;h. Less than 0.1&#x000a0;% of the apparent dose was renally excreted as the parent compound. Renal elimination of total rotigotine covers 11.7&#x000a0;% of absorbed dose in Japanese subjects and 10.8&#x000a0;% of the absorbed dose in Caucasians, whereas the renal elimination via total despropyl rotigotine was 8.2 and 7.1&#x000a0;%, respectively. The corresponding values for total desthienylethyl rotigotine were 3.5&#x000a0;% in Japanese subjects and 4.2&#x000a0;% Caucasians. Most adverse events were mild in intensity and typical for dopamine agonists or for transdermal therapeutics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Administration of a single patch delivering 2&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;h rotigotine resulted in comparable pharmacokinetic profiles in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The rotigotine transdermal patch was generally well-tolerated. Our findings suggest similar dose requirements for Japanese and Caucasian populations.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Treatment of PD is complex due to the progressive nature and array of motor and non-motor features of the disease, and the early and late side effects associated with therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Levodopa is still the most potent symptomatic drug for PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; however, guidelines recommend initial treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist (particularly in young-onset patients) to avoid the development of motor complications associated with long-term levodopa use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dopamine receptor agonists are also recommended as the first-line treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Rotigotine, the levorotatory enantiomer of racemic aminotetralin, is a novel non-ergolinic dopamine receptor agonist with preferential binding to D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and D<sub>1</sub> receptor subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Rotigotine has been incorporated into a silicone-based transdermal patch that provides continuous drug delivery and stable plasma concentrations when the patch is replaced once every 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Following application, approximately half of the administered rotigotine dose (46&#x000a0;%) is systemically absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Rotigotine is rapidly metabolized, mainly by conjugation (sulfation and glucuronidation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The terminal elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) of unconjugated rotigotine is 5.4&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and of conjugated rotigotine is approximately 10&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A second pathway is the formation of inactive <italic>N</italic>-desalkyl metabolites with subsequent conjugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Efficacy of rotigotine in the treatment of early PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], advanced PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and RLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] has been demonstrated in randomized placebo-controlled trials and rotigotine is approved for the treatment of PD and RLS in Europe and the USA.</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability of rotigotine have mainly been investigated in Caucasian subjects. Various factors including differences in height, body weight, genetic polymorphism in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2C9, and enzyme, transporter and receptor saturation, may influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rotigotine in subjects of different ethnic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The route of administration also plays a role and ethnic differences may not be relevant if the drug is applied transdermally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Many physicians prescribe medications at lower doses when treating Asian patients with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, subtherapeutic doses of the dopamine receptor agonist pergolide are commonly used in clinical practice in Japan; although doses of up to 1.25&#x000a0;mg/day are recommended for Japanese patients, many receive just 0.6&#x000a0;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is important that potential pharmacokinetic differences are considered when determining dose adjustments for different ethnic groups. To compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of rotigotine in subjects of different ethnic origin, the administration of a single transdermal patch (delivering 2&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;h) in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects was investigated in this open-label phase&#x000a0;I clinical study (NCT01761526).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Population and Design</title><p>This open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study was carried out at FOCUS Clinical Drug Development GmbH, Neuss, Germany in 2002.

Japanese participants were required to have been born in Japan to parents of 100&#x000a0;% Japanese origin, and to have left Japan no more than 10&#x000a0;years before the start of the study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included a clinically relevant allergy; known or suspected drug hypersensitivity (in particular to any components of the trial medication); prior or current clinically relevant medical or psychiatric conditions; a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse; positive testing for alcohol or drugs, HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody; and blood donation or comparable blood loss of &#x0003e;350&#x000a0;mL within 3&#x000a0;months prior to patch application. In addition, no acute diseases, skin diseases, suspicious and undiagnosed skin lesions, skin tumors, history of significant hypersensitivity to adhesives or other transdermal products, or recent unresolved contact dermatitis were allowed. Individuals were also excluded if they had participated in a clinical trial of an investigational product within 3&#x000a0;months prior to patch application; had used any concomitant medication (excluding paracetamol) within 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to patch application; had used methylphenidate, amphetamines, or catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase inhibitors within 28&#x000a0;days prior to patch application; or had used monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa, antipsychotic agents, antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, flunarizine, cinnarizine, metoclopramide, risperidone, or quetiapine or any other known enzyme-inducing or inhibiting agent within 3&#x000a0;months prior to patch application. More than 5 cigarettes/day, 600&#x000a0;mg caffeine/day, and/or 20&#x000a0;g alcohol/day, a diet deviating notably from normal daily amounts of proteins, carbohydrates or fat, or heavy physical exertion 2&#x000a0;days before the eligibility assessment also led to exclusion. Female subjects were excluded if they were without medically adequate contraception, were pregnant or lactating, or had taken oral contraceptives or hormone replacement within 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the eligibility assessment. Caucasian and Japanese subjects were matched by sex, BMI (&#x000b1;10&#x000a0;%), and age (&#x000b1;5&#x000a0;years). The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and amendments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the &#x02018;&#x000c4;rztekammer Nordrhein&#x02019;, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Eligibility assessments (medical history, complete physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs and laboratory screening, alcohol/drug screening and serology, and pregnancy test) were conducted within 21&#x000a0;days before patch application. Eligibility was confirmed on Day &#x02212;1 (day before patch application) with a repeat of the physical examination, vital signs, ECG, pregnancy test, and alcohol/drug screening. Eligible subjects were hospitalized on the day of patch application for a period of 60&#x000a0;h. One 10&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> patch containing 4.5&#x000a0;mg rotigotine (2&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;h delivery) (UCB Pharma, Monheim am Rhein, Germany) was applied to the ventral/lateral abdomen in the morning and removed after 24&#x000a0;h. Subjects stayed in bed for at least 2&#x000a0;h after patch application. A follow-up visit was conducted within 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample Collection and Analytical Methods</title><p>Blood samples for the pharmacokinetic assessment of rotigotine and metabolites in plasma were collected into lithium-heparinized monovettes prior to patch application (0&#x000a0;h) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, 48, and 60&#x000a0;h after patch application. Assessments included both unconjugated and total rotigotine (total rotigotine&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;unconjugated rotigotine&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;conjugated rotigotine), and the metabolites despropyl and desthienylethyl rotigotine. Samples were assayed untreated and after pre-incubation with glucuronidase to convert glucuronide and sulfate conjugates back into the unconjugated moiety for total rotigotine determination. Concentrations of rotigotine and metabolites in plasma were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) using Positive Electrospray Ionization (ESI) and Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) with the following lower limits of quantification (LLQ): 0.01&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated rotigotine, 0.01&#x000a0;ng/mL for total rotigotine, 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL for total despropyl rotigotine, and 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL for total desthienylethyl rotigotine. Internal standards were fentanyl citrate (Promochem, Wesel, Germany) for assay of unconjugated and total rotigotine and <italic>N</italic>-despropyl-propafenone oxalate for assay of the desalkyl metabolites. Standard curves were linear within the calibration range 0.01&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated and total rotigotine, and 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;ng/mL for the metabolites. Overall accuracy and precision for calibration standards and quality controls were well within 10&#x000a0;% at all concentrations.</p><p>For the evaluation of renal excretion of rotigotine and its metabolites, urine was collected pre-dose and 0&#x02013;24, 24&#x02013;48, and 48&#x02013;60&#x000a0;h after patch application. Urine samples were analyzed by LC&#x02013;MS/MS with the following LLQs: 0.05&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated rotigotine, 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated despropyl rotigotine, 0.25&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated desthienylethyl rotigotine, and 0.5&#x000a0;ng/mL for total despropyl rotigotine, total desthienylethyl rotigotine, and total rotigotine. Standard curves were linear within the calibration range of 0.05&#x02013;2.0&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated rotigotine, 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;ng/mL for unconjugated desthienylethyl rotigotine, and 0.5&#x02013;30&#x000a0;ng/mL for total rotigotine and total despropyl and desthienylethyl rotigotine.

No relevant differences in <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> were observed. Bioavailabilities of unconjugated rotigotine following administration of a single dose were similar in each ethnic group. Point estimates for AUC<sub>last</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> included unity, indicating a similar exposure to the active substance. Individual concentration levels for unconjugated rotigotine in plasma showed a high variability between subjects. The variability of the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters AUC<sub>last</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was reduced after normalization by body weight and by apparent dose. Sex differences in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> for unconjugated rotigotine were also minimized after body weight normalization.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of total rotigotine differed between ethnic groups. AUC<sub>last</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values were &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% higher in Japanese subjects than in Caucasians. Point estimates indicated a statistical difference that was minimized by normalization for body weight, but not by normalization for apparent dose. The very high CL of unchanged rotigotine (~500&#x000a0;L/h in both ethnic groups) indicates extensive metabolism as the main route of elimination. This is in line with an extremely high <italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub> of about 4,000&#x000a0;L. Differences between <italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub> values in Japanese and Caucasian subjects may reflect differences in body weight. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine, especially elimination via metabolism, can be concluded. Total rotigotine concentrations do not play a role in treatment efficacy but may affect the safety and tolerability of the medication. However, the overall incidence of AEs was similar in both ethnic groups and the high plasma concentrations observed in two Caucasian subjects were not associated with a higher incidence or intensity of AEs.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of total rotigotine desalkyl metabolites were similar in both ethnic groups; however, they were near or below the LLQ. The low concentrations of metabolites in plasma and the high variability of the values in all subgroups confounded interpretation of the pharmacokinetic parameters. The CL<sub>R</sub> of the active substance was similar in both groups. The <italic>A</italic><sub>e</sub> was slightly higher for Japanese subjects but accounted for &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;% of the dose absorbed, indicating a very small contribution of renal excretion to the CL of unconjugated rotigotine. Comparable amounts of total rotigotine and total desalkyl metabolites were excreted into urine. The proportion of total despropyl metabolite was more than double that of the desthienylethyl metabolite for both ethnic groups. The metabolic profile of rotigotine observed in our study is in agreement with the results of a pharmacokinetic study in Caucasian subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The major isoenzyme involved in rotigotine N-desalkylation, CYP2C19, is known to be differentially expressed in different ethnic groups; around 25&#x000a0;% of Asian individuals and 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% of Caucasians have a poor metabolizer phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, a study in healthy Caucasian subjects has shown that selective inhibition of CYP2C19 does not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of rotigotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rotigotine dose adjustment may not be necessary in patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers.</p><p>Application of a single rotigotine patch was safe and generally well-tolerated. Most AEs were mild in intensity and typical of dopamine agonists (e.g., nausea) or transdermal therapeutics (e.g., mild and transient erythema). Japanese subjects reported a higher incidence of application-site reactions (100 vs. 85&#x000a0;%) and a lower incidence of headache (25 vs. 50&#x000a0;%) than Caucasians. In the current study, the higher incidence of AEs observed in women than in men (58 vs. 42&#x000a0;%) may be due to sex-related differences in pharmacodynamic response. Patch adhesiveness was good for both ethnic groups; it was, however, better in Japanese than Caucasian subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The administration of a single patch delivering 2&#x000a0;mg/24&#x000a0;h rotigotine resulted in comparable pharmacokinetic profiles in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.
