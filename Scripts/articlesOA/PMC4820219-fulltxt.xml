As risks and side effects of long-term intervention outweigh the benefits in the general COPD population, the optimal dose, duration of treatment, and target population are yet to be defined. Hospitalization for an acute exacerbation (AE) of COPD may offer a targeted risk group and an obvious risk period for studying macrolide interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients with COPD, hospitalized for an AE, who have a smoking history of &#x02265;10 pack-years and had &#x02265;1 exacerbation in the previous year will be enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02135354). On top of a standardized treatment of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics, subjects will be randomized to receive either azithromycin or placebo during 3 months, at an uploading dose of 500 mg once a day for 3 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg once every 2 days. The primary endpoint is the time-to-treatment failure during the treatment phase (ie, from the moment of randomization until the end of intervention). Treatment failure is a novel composite endpoint defined as either death, the admission to intensive care or the requirement of additional systemic steroids or new antibiotics for respiratory reasons, or the diagnosis of a new AE after discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigate whether azithromycin initiated at the onset of a severe exacerbation, with a limited duration and at a low dose, might be effective and safe in the highest risk period during and immediately after the acute event. If proven effective and safe, this targeted approach may improve the treatment of severe AEs and redirect the preventive use of azithromycin in COPD to a temporary intervention in the subgroup with the highest unmet needs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>acute exacerbation</kwd><kwd>macrolide antibiotics</kwd><kwd>azithromycin</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major health challenges of the next decades and is currently estimated by Global Burden of Disease studies as the third leading cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="b1-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is a chronic disease characterized by airflow limitation which is progressive, not fully reversible and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles and gases.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The high burden of COPD resulting from its respiratory symptoms is further enhanced by recurrent exacerbations,<xref rid="b5-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which are triggered mainly by the acquisition of new strains of respiratory pathogens or an increase in the concentration of bacteria colonizing the lower airways.<xref rid="b7-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Known to drive progressive lung function decline and physical inactivity, these acute events contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality, and the resulting hospitalizations impose a significant strain on health care resource utilization.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Although the spectrum of available COPD treatments reduces the frequency of exacerbations by approximately 20%&#x02013;30%,<xref rid="b12-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> they are insufficient as many patients still experience at least one exacerbation a year of which one-quarter requires hospitalization. A recent large European audit on COPD exacerbations in hospitalized patients revealed that these events were associated with 12% mortality and 35% risk of readmission within 3 months after discharge.<xref rid="b16-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It is needless to argue that our current acute interventions are lacking effectiveness in a substantial proportion of the COPD admissions and that new interventions in this particular subset of patients are warranted. Bacterial infections are responsible for around half of the acute exacerbations (AEs) of COPD.<xref rid="b17-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Current guidelines therefore recommend antibiotic therapy for patients with more severe symptoms, with treatment typically lasting 5&#x02013;7 days. Although such intervention has shown to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations, relapse is common with some patients remaining at high risk for recurrent episodes for several weeks after the initial event. Failure may be related to inadequate antibiotic efficacy, but even with effective bacterial eradication, or in case of noninfectious events, increased airway inflammation may persist for a prolonged period after discharge and will likely promote recurrence.<xref rid="b9-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Epidemiological data confirm that the risk for subsequent events peaks drastically during 90 days after discharge and clearly increases with every following hospital admission.<xref rid="b18-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Disrupting the vicious cycle of one severe exacerbation introducing a subsequent one is therefore a promising interventional strategy.</p><p>Several randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of long-term macrolide treatment in a variety of chronic respiratory diseases, particularly in diffuse panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome post-lung transplantation, and bronchiectasis.<xref rid="b19-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The potential of long-term macrolide treatment for preventing COPD exacerbations has been recently confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial showing that chronic azithromycin therapy over 1 year, on top of standard inhalation therapy, reduced the risk of exacerbations by &#x0223c;30%.<xref rid="b24-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, the long-term use of this class of antibiotics is not recommended in all patients with COPD as it is inevitably associated with bacterial resistance and carries the risk for side effects such as hearing loss and life-threatening arrhythmias by the prolongation of the QT interval.<xref rid="b25-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Despite its potent effects and its proof of concept, uncertainty remains about the specific patient population that is most likely to benefit and also about the optimal dose and duration of the macrolide treatment.<xref rid="b26-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> For these reasons, a recent update of the international treatment recommendations for COPD by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) still did not incorporate azithromycin in its therapeutic arsenal.<xref rid="b4-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Reducing the dose and time course of the azithromycin intervention, as well as restricting the treatment to a subgroup of patients with COPD with the highest risk for future exacerbations, may overcome some of these concerns, and would therefore be a major step forward to a targeted clinical use.<xref rid="b25-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b27-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Additionally, short courses of macrolides were shown to facilitate the weaning process in ventilator-associated pneumonia and to shorten the time to resolution of pneumonia by approximately 40%.<xref rid="b28-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In AEs of asthma, 10 days of neomacrolides resulted in a significant symptom improvement compared to placebo.<xref rid="b29-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In line with these immediate therapeutic benefits for other acute respiratory diseases, azithromycin therapy, initiated at the onset of acute COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission, may also improve short-term outcomes of hospitalization and prevent early relapse.</p><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the main aim is to assess whether a targeted course of low-dose azithromycin for 3 months, initiated at the onset of a severe AE requiring hospitalization, might be effective and safe in the highest risk period, that is, during and immediately after the acute event.</p><sec><title>Content</title><p>This paper describes the BACE (the Belgian trial with azithromycin for acute COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization; clinicaltrial.gov number: NCT02135354) study design and its novel contributions to the current clinical research in the management of AEs of COPD.

Besides the lead center at the University Hospital in Leuven, patients will also be recruited from six academic and 13 nonacademic hospitals within Belgium.

Within 48 hours after hospital admission, a 3-month treatment phase with azithromycin or placebo is initiated at an uploading dose of 500 mg once a day for 3 days and subsequently administered at a lower maintenance dose of 250 mg every 2 days for the remainder of the 90-day treatment period. Patients will then be followed up for an additional 6 months to evaluate the recurrence rate after the withdrawal of study drug.</p><p>The BACE trial study design is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-11-687">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for duration and dose of azithromycin</title><p>In 2011, Albert et al showed that azithromycin reduces the risk of future COPD exacerbations by &#x0223c;30% on top of standard inhalation therapy when given chronically for over a year at a dose of 250 mg once daily. Careful observation of the data revealed that a major part of the reduction in exacerbations is already obtained within 90 days after treatment onset. Thereafter, the curves representing the proportion of patients free from AEs may still diverge, whereas after 6 months of treatment, a more steady and equal decline for both the placebo and intervention arm are reached.<xref rid="b24-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Remarkably, in the study by Wong et al on the reduction of exacerbations in bronchiectasis, in which azithromycin was stopped after 6 months of treatment, benefits persisted for another 6 months of follow-up.<xref rid="b23-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It indicates that the withdrawal of azithromycin after prolonged intake of 3&#x02013;6 months is reasonable to consider and sufficient for interrupting the circle of inflammation, infection, and relapse.</p><p>In addition to the optimal duration for the azithromycin intervention, uncertainty remains about the ideal dose to target therapeutic serum and tissue levels.<xref rid="b26-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Earlier pharmacokinetic studies have found that a dose of 500 mg corresponded to serum peak levels of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/mL with a half-life of 40&#x02013;68 hours.

By using this endpoint, the potential short-term benefits of acute macrolide treatment, as well as the long-term benefits of prolonged treatment, are utilized. The combined endpoint is defined as either death, the admission to intensive care or the requirement of additional systemic steroids or new antibiotics for respiratory reasons, or the diagnosis of a new AE of COPD after discharge. Each of the components in the combined endpoint bears the same weight; once one is fulfilled, the primary endpoint is met. The use of this combined endpoint of treatment failure in the first 3 months is in line with earlier studies on the efficacy of systemic steroids during the AE<xref rid="b37-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and will avoid arbitrary clinical decisions on whether recurrent symptoms or therapy needed is related to an incomplete resolution or to a new acute event.</p><p>Key secondary endpoints are the number of clinical failures at day 90, symptom COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score at day 90, and total days of steroid use at day 90.

Documented approval has been obtained from the Leading Ethics Committee (Commissie Medische Ethiek UZ KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium - affiliated to UZ KU Leuven) and the competent authority (Federaal Agentschap voor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten [Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products], Brussels, Belgium). All patients must provide a written informed consent according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and local legal requirements. Randomized patients, willing to participate in the PROactive and/or pharmacoeconomic substudy, will have to give an informed consent for the additional measures related to either of the substudies. However, individual patients can choose to opt out for these measures and only to participate in the medical intervention study, the BACE trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><sec><title>Efficacy population</title><p>The primary endpoint will be evaluated in the intention-to-treat population, that is, all randomized patients. As a secondary analysis, the primary endpoint will also be evaluated in the per-protocol population (not including dropouts and including only patients with satisfactory adherence to the intake of the study drug).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Two hundred and fifty subjects per group, 500 subjects in total, will yield 80% power to show a significant difference in the primary endpoint at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Sample size calculation is based on a survival analysis using a logrank test assuming proportional hazards, a clinical failure in at least 45% of the placebo arm within 3 months (based on 35% readmissions in the Belgian COPD population in the European COPD audit,<xref rid="b16-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> a proportion of 50% with a new exacerbation within 4 months after randomization in the randomized trial with vitamin D enrolling similar but stable patients,<xref rid="b39-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and a 20% treatment failure within 8 weeks in the MAESTRAL study looking at mild exacerbations<xref rid="b40-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), a 35% relative improvement with azithromycin intervention (hazard ratio (HR) =0.65; HR of 0.73 for time to first exacerbation,<xref rid="b24-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> HR of 0.5 for time to the resolution of ventilator-associated pneumonia<xref rid="b28-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and taking into account a maximal amount of 25% of dropouts. After the inclusion of 125 patients, recruitment was somewhat lower than anticipated and the observed dropout was also lower (16/125 [12.8%]). Therefore, it was opted to foresee an interim analysis for efficacy and futility when 300 patients reach their 90-day follow-up. Assuming a lower dropout rate of 17% and the same other assumptions as mentioned earlier, the trial remains powered at 80% with a sample size of 500 patients and a total number of 177 events. Sample size calculation was done using EAST Version 6.3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>As cardiac safety and the risk of QT prolongation are major concerns during an AE requiring hospital admission, an interim safety and efficacy analysis will be performed as soon as 300 patients have completed their 3-month visit. They will be tested for both efficacy and futility using the alpha- and beta-spending functions of O&#x02019;Brien&#x02013;Fleming.<xref rid="b41-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The amount of information will be assessed by the number of observed events over the required number of 177 events to obtain 80% power. Full details will be available in a statistical analysis plan. These analyses will be performed by an independent safety committee consisting of a cardiologist and a statistician.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All patients randomized will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed by means of a logrank test. In addition, a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval from a Cox proportional hazards model will be provided. A serial gatekeeping method<xref rid="b42-copd-11-687" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> will be used to control the family-wise type I error of the key secondary endpoints that will be addressed in the following hierarchy: number of clinical failures at day 90, symptom CAT score at day 90, and total days of steroid use at day 90. All other secondary outcomes and all analyses performed at day 90 and day 270 will be considered as exploratory. A 5% significance level will be used. Full details will be available in a statistical analysis plan which will be finalized before the interim analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Data will be collected in an electronic case report form by the local investigators and their dedicated clinical trial assistants, and will be monitored by the central study coordinators of the BACE trial blinded to the randomization code prior to a total database lock. There is no external clinical research organization. Particular attention will go to the adjudication of the primary endpoint as this is a composite one of which all components bear the same weight. For the interim as well as the final analysis, the database will also be checked for outliers after, respectively, the 300th patient has completed his day 90 visit and after the last patient has completed his day 270 follow-up visit. These outliers will be linked to the original on-site documents for revision via queries to the local investigators and clinical trial assistants. After database lock, the randomization code will be broken and the statistical analysis will be performed according to a comprehensive statistical plan which defines primary, secondary, safety, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This randomized placebo-controlled trial aims to establish an appropriate but more restricted use of azithromycin during and immediately after hospital admission for a severe exacerbation of COPD to overcome the highest risk period for treatment failure, relapse, and death. The proposed intervention will deal not only with short-term in-hospital outcomes but also with the relapse rate during the 3 months after discharge, a period known to have the highest risk for deterioration.</p><p>By reducing the dose and the duration of treatment with azithromycin and by targeting the treatment to acute periods with the highest risk for treatment failure, benefits may counterbalance potential side effects of macrolides, which may result in a new treatment strategy for severe AE of COPD. If proven to be safe and effective, a breakthrough in the acute treatment setting will be obtained and the chronic use of high-dose azithromycin in a large and poorly defined population of patients with COPD, with inherent risks and side effects, will be reserved for well-defined subgroups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The BACE trial is funded by a grant from the Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie (IWT) through the Toegepast Biomedisch onderzoek met een primair Maatschappelijke finaliteit (TBM) program: IWT&#x02013;TBM number: 130233.
