Both cultivars were imposed to gradual water depletion started on day 17 till day 32 after sowing. Sids, the more tolerant cultivar to drought showed higher fresh and dry weights than the drought sensitive genotype, Gmiza. Under water stress, Sids had higher membrane stability index (MSI), lower accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes; catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) than Gmiza. On the other hand, the differential expression patterns of the genes <italic>dhn</italic>, <italic>wcor</italic> and <italic>dreb</italic> were observed due to water deficit intensity according to cultivar&#x02019;s tolerance to drought. The DNA sequence alignment of <italic>dun</italic> showed high similarity of about 80&#x02013;92% identities with other related plants. The most striking overall observed trend was the highly induction in the expression of <italic>dun</italic>, <italic>wcor</italic> and <italic>dreb</italic> in leaves of the tolerant genotype, Sids under severe water stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antioxidants</kwd><kwd><italic>dhn</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>dreb</italic></kwd><kwd>Drought stress</kwd><kwd><italic>wcor</italic></kwd><kwd>Wheat cultivars</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drought is a wide world problem constraining global crop production seriously <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Common wheat possesses a very complex and huge genome with size of &#x0223c;16&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>&#x000a0;bp, which consists of about 90% repeated sequences <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Under drought stress, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated as a result of electron leakage from the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains to oxygen or during photorespiration resulting from the oxygenase activity of Rubisco. Also, drought results in changes in antioxidant enzymes activity. High antioxidant activities could be interpreted as symptoms of oxidative stress or damage, the plant upregulates antioxidant enzymes because it produces more reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Conversely, high antioxidant activity could be interpreted as higher tolerance to oxidative stress.</p><p>Alteration of gene expression is always involved in preparing plants for an existence under stress. Under conditions of water deficit (dehydration), numerous processes are modified or impaired resulting in growth inhibition <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> to cope with osmotic changes in their tissues. Modification of gene expression results in a strict control of the physiological and biochemical responses to stress. Identification and isolation of these genes are essential for developing tolerant crops. Expression profiling has become an important tool to investigate responses of an organism to environmental changes at the transcriptional level <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One of these adaptations is to produce proteins called dehydrins. Dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs) constitute a large family of TFs that induce the expression of a large number of functional genes and impart stress endurance to plants <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The dehydration responsive element (DRE) as a cis-acting element was found in the promoter regions of many drought- and low-temperature-inducible genes <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. All <italic>dreb</italic> genes feature three conserved regions, an EREBP/AP2 DNA binding domain, an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, and conserved Ser/Thr rich region adjacent to the EREBP/AP2 domain. <italic>dreb tfs</italic> play key roles in plant stress signaling transduction pathway, they can specifically bind to DRE/CRT element (G/ACCGAC) and activate the expression of many stress inducible genes. In several cases, the overexpression of these <italic>dreb</italic>/<italic>cbf</italic> genes was associated with retardation of plant growth under non stressful conditions <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It was suggested that the overexpression of these genes under stress-inducible promoter but not constitutive promoter may be a solution to avoid the change in plant growth <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Dehydrins <italic>dhn</italic> are associated with crucial protective functions <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>dhn</italic> are part of the late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA) <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. They are produced in response to abscisic acid (ABA) <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. They are primarily distributed in cytosol, nucleus and plasma membranes <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Dreb controls expression of cold-regulated (<italic>cor</italic>) gene. Wcor410 is a dehydrin that accumulates around the plasma membrane and is present in lesser amounts in the intercellular space <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is up regulated by low temperatures, dehydration, ABA, salt, wounding and polyethylene glycol. So, the present work is aimed at studying the expression of <italic>wdhn</italic>, <italic>dreb</italic> and <italic>wcor410</italic> in order to find their roles in drought tolerance of two wheat cultivars that differentially tolerate water stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Plant material and growing conditions</title><p>Seeds of two bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) cultivars, (Sids 4, and Gmiza 10) were obtained from Wheat Research Department, Field Crops Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, Giza, Egypt.

Sayar et al. <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported that there was a decrease in the seedling fresh weight of both drought tolerant and sensitive durum wheat cultivars as osmotic potentials increased. Moreover, the dry weight of Sids was not significantly affected by drought by the end of the experiment although drought significantly decreased dry weight of Gmiza. Drought may limit the growth of the plant organs thereby reducing meristems and finally decreasing the capacity of vegetation <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. More increase in dry weight of Sids was detected after 16&#x000a0;days drought stress than the other cultivar. This means that Sids was the superior cultivar in its growth and this probably due to the vigor and strength of its genotype.</p><p>Specific leaf area is a marker for the regulation of plant leaf following abiotic stress factors including drought <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The specific leaf area was larger in Sids, the more tolerant cultivar, than in Gmiza the less tolerant one. According to our results, drought did not change Sids leaf area at early stress but led to a significant decrease during the period from 26 to 30 DAS. Conversely, drought stress caused insignificant decrease in leaf area in Gmiza comparing control values. Sayar et al. <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> found decrease in leaf area in both tolerant and sensitive cultivars of durum wheat linearly as osmotic potentials in PEG increased. Reduction of leaf area in the more tolerant cultivar, Sids may be a try to decrease the transpiring area as an adaptive response to water deficit for avoiding water loss.</p><p>Cell membranes are among the first targets of adverse stresses and the maintenance of membrane integrity and stability under abiotic stress conditions is a major component of environmental stress tolerance in plants <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our results showed a reduction in membrane stability index in both genotypes due to mild drought stress followed by severe reduction in sensitive genotype. The decrease in MSI progressively augmented with increasing drought severity. These results are in agreement with those of Filippou et al. <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the present results revealed that mild drought induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in Sids and Gmiza. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content sharply dropped in Sids at 23 DAS but its accumulation continued in Gmiza. These findings are in accordance with the results of Wang et al. <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> who found that exposure of plants to moderate stress can induce tolerance to severe stress. Such treatment can improve tolerance to other stress as so-called cross-acclimation to stress usually functions to rescue plants from oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Severe drought stimulates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in Gmiza plants suggesting a lack of an enhanced capacity for protection from oxidative damage caused by drought stress in this sensitive cultivar. Actually, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by photorespiration can act on the redox states of leaf antioxidant pools, implicating the possibility of photorespiratory H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a signal role under drought <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The results of antioxidant enzymes showed variation and differentiation between tolerant and sensitive genotypes. CAT enzyme showed high significant activity in Sids genotype at all intervals and reached its maximum activity at moderate drought stress. Contrarily, there was no significant response to drought stress in the sensitive cultivar Gmiza except on 30 DAS. Accordingly, Rivero et al. <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> found that CAT remained more active for a greater duration of drought stress. APX and POD might be responsible for the fine modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for signaling, whereas CAT might be responsible for or the removal of excess ROS during stress <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, GPX activity showed significant increase in Sids genotype nearly during all the experimental period. However, there was no significant response in Gmiza to drought. Various stressful conditions of the environment have been shown to induce the activity of GPX <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. POD, APX and glutathione reductase are involved in fine regulation of ROS and loss of their activities resulted in build up of ROS to high levels that resulted in CAT induction. It appears that there was an association between the higher antioxidant capacity and higher tolerance to drought stress in our tolerant wheat cultivar. The association between the levels/activities of antioxidant enzymes and plant drought tolerance has been previously observed <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This strong antioxidant system under stress conditions plays a major role in stress tolerance of both leaves and roots of many species.</p><p>It has been reported that dehydrin accumulation is correlated with dehydration when dehydrin accumulation was compared in dried cereal seedlings <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. <italic>dhn</italic> data of the present results were in accordance with that observed by Lopez et al. <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> in drought-tolerant wheat compared with drought-sensitive plants. Dehydrins were thought to be associated with crucial protective functions <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recently, antioxidative activity has been proposed to be an important function of dehydrins <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, since <italic>CuCOR19</italic> was proposed to have antioxidative activity <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and <italic>PvSR3</italic> dehydrin was suggested to protect cells against oxidative damage caused by ROS and metal ions <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In accordance, the present results exhibited a general relationship between enzymatic antioxidants and <italic>dhn</italic>. Indeed, the more tolerant cultivar, Sids showed greater stimulation of antioxidant enzymes and also a 3-fold increase in the mRNA of <italic>dhn</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the transcript level of <italic>wco</italic>r gene, drought stress resulted in over regulation in Sids cultivar more than Gmiza. On the other hand, rewatering both cultivars resulted in sharp reduction in the transcript level of <italic>wcor</italic> gene to reach its minimum level during treatment period. Moreover, there was a dense early expression for <italic>wcor</italic> gene after 37 cycles in the droughted Gmiza after 6&#x000a0;days drought. Similarly, findings of Kurahashi et al. <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> on wild wheat <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> showed that KU-2829A, with high ABA sensitivity and drought tolerance, showed more rapid response in cold-responsive / late embryogenesis abundant (<italic>cor</italic>/<italic>lea</italic>) gene expression than the ABA-insensitive and drought-sensitive KU-2811. As indicated for <italic>dhn</italic>, there was a relationship between <italic>wcor</italic> and the efficiency of the antioxidant enzymes. The transcript level of <italic>wcor</italic> was increased more in the tolerant cultivar, Sids than in the sensitive one particularly under severe drought stress. The same pattern was also detected regarding the antioxidant enzymes supporting their relationship.</p><p><italic>dreb2</italic> homologs contribute to increase multiple stress tolerance in several plant species <xref rid="b0210 b0215 b0220 b0225" ref-type="bibr">[42&#x02013;45]</xref> expression is induced by low temperature, drought, NaCl exposure, and exogenous ABA treatment <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Drought stress differentially regulated the expression level of <italic>dreb</italic> gene in both cultivars. The increased <italic>dreb</italic> expression by drought was reported by Chen et al. <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In this context, the level of mRNA of <italic>dreb</italic> was sharply decreased after 6&#x000a0;days of dehydration in the sensitive cultivar, Gmiza but increased in the more tolerant one, Sids. Such increase continued to become maximum value after 10&#x000a0;days of water stress. A similar trend was also detected in enzymatic antioxidants pointing out to the presence of a general relationship between antioxidants and <italic>dreb</italic>. Altering the expression level of a single <italic>dreb</italic>/<italic>cbf</italic> can increase or decrease levels of expression of other transcription factors, which in turn, can lead to activation of a larger number of target genes, some of which may be directly activated not by the initially over-expressed <italic>dreb</italic>/<italic>cbf</italic> but by downstream <italic>drebs</italic>/<italic>cbfs</italic>. Several research groups have shown that raising levels of <italic>dreb</italic>/<italic>cbf</italic> expression by plant transformation enhance expression of downstream target genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, also known as dehydrins (DHNs), and cold-responsive (COR) proteins <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s1055"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present work is an attempt to clarify the direct relationship between <italic>wdreb</italic> and the two <italic>cor</italic> and <italic>dhn</italic> genes in development of drought stress tolerance in wheat using two cultivars with different drought tolerance. According to the present results, <italic>dreb</italic> seemed to activate the transcription process of <italic>Tadhn</italic> and <italic>wcor</italic>. Almost all genes examined in Sids and Gmiza appeared to be regulated by drought stress and subsequent rewatering in a variable manner. The most striking overall trend observed was the acute induction in expression of <italic>dhn</italic>, <italic>wcor</italic> and <italic>dreb</italic> in leaves tissue during severe water stress conditions in tolerant genotype Sids. Moreover, there was a general relationship of the enzymatic antioxidants with the genes <italic>dhn</italic>, <italic>wcor</italic> and <italic>dreb</italic>. A further study is needed to elucidate the transcription factors in relation to these antioxidant enzymes with the dreb genes. Some transcription factors that regulate the expression of several genes related to stress have been discovered <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Transcriptome analysis has revealed that dozens of transcription factors are involved in the plant response to various stresses <xref rid="b0245 b0250" ref-type="bibr">[49,50]</xref>. Transcription factors control the rates of transcription to regulate the amounts of gene products (RNA and protein) available to the cell. DREBs are important plant transcription factors that regulate the expression of many stress-inducible genes <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. So, the data presented here indicate a cross-talk between physiological and molecular tolerance mechanisms in response to drought stress.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><title>Conflict of
