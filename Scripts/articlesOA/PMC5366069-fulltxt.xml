Traditional phenotypically guided genetic testing may fail to identify rarer causes of disease as many conditions have a highly variable clinical presentation. The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to interrogate the exome sequence (ES) or whole genome sequence (WGS) may circumvent some of these difficulties since these approaches are agnostic to the underlying genetic cause.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></p><p>Craniosynostosis, a condition that affects &#x0223c;1 in 2250 births,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> is defined as the premature fusion of one or more of the normally patent cranial sutures, a consequence of disruption in the coordinated patterning, proliferation and differentiation of these tissues.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It has a highly heterogeneous and complex aetiology with contributions from monogenic, chromosomal, polygenic and environmental factors all playing a role.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Craniosynostosis most commonly occurs in isolation, but a minority of cases are associated with additional clinical features as part of a syndrome, probably reflecting the co-option of pleiotropic signalling pathways to pattern and maintain the suture; association with &#x0003e;100 human syndromes has been reported.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An underlying genetic cause can be identified in &#x0223c;24% of cases, with mutations in just six genes (in decreasing order of frequency: <italic>FGFR2</italic>, <italic>FGFR3</italic>, <italic>TWIST1</italic>, <italic>TCF12</italic>, <italic>ERF</italic> and <italic>EFNB1</italic>) together accounting for over three-quarters of monogenic diagnoses.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;19</xref> At least 52 other genes have been identified as recurrently mutated in craniosynostosis,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> but these rarer targets do not tend to be included in molecular testing panels unless indicated by specific clinical features. Craniosynostosis may also present as a low-frequency association with intellectual disability syndromes, possibly related to disturbed maintenance of suture patency.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>To evaluate the utility of ES and WGS in this context, we used these technologies to search for a molecular diagnosis in 40 patients with craniosynostosis who had previously been evaluated using existing routine molecular testing, without a diagnosis being made. Cases were identified as being of high priority for further investigation either by craniofacial clinical geneticists or by laboratory scientists specialising in craniofacial molecular diagnostics. From this cohort, we identified an underlying molecular lesion in 15 (37.5%) families. We document several cases where the mutation identified either did not obviously fit with the original clinical diagnosis or where identification of the causal mutation would have proved difficult using traditional methods of molecular testing. We highlight five families for which diagnosis has immediately impacted on clinical management or counselling. This work illustrates the molecular diversity of causes of craniosynostosis and the added value that can be gained by a comprehensive diagnostic approach in difficult cases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement and prior clinical investigation</title><p>Written, informed consent for genetic research and publication of clinical photographs was obtained by the referring clinicians and their research teams.

Clinical geneticists were asked to prioritise cases thought most likely to have a genetic diagnosis (based on presence of syndromic features, multiple sutures affected, consanguinity or positive family history, and lack of any obvious environmental predisposition), particularly where there were active issues with genetic counselling. Twelve of the cases initially identified by clinical geneticists were excluded either because further targeted genetic testing identified a monogenic cause (one case each with mutations in <italic>ERF</italic>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<italic>FGFR2</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and <italic>FLNA,</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and two with <italic>IL11RA</italic> mutations),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> where enrolment into the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> was considered more appropriate (n=5) or where samples were not available for analysis (n=2). The remaining cases (n=24), together with parental samples (where available), were enrolled into the craniofacial research study following informed consent. Sequencing comprised 12 singletons, 1 parent&#x02013;child duo, 10 parent&#x02013;child trios and 1 trio comprising three affected individuals. Similar criteria were used by clinical laboratory scientists to prioritise 20 cases for ES; however, clinical information tended to be more limited and availability of sufficient stored DNA sample was often a decisive factor for case inclusion. For the laboratory samples, consent for research investigation was sought secondarily to enable the entire exome to be interrogated; two cases were excluded because consent was not obtained. In 16 of the remaining 18 laboratory diagnostic cases, ES was performed on the proband only; in one instance, the exome of an affected sibling was already available, and in another the family trio subsequently had WGS. Two duplicate families (29 and 34) identified by both clinicians and laboratory scientists are listed under the latter category in <xref rid="JMEDGENET2016104215TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, which summarises the patterns of cranial suture involvement and syndromic features of the final total of 40 patients/families analysed, with further details in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref>.

The number of mutations identified in patients recruited via clinical geneticists (including the two duplicate ascertainments) was higher (11/24; 46%) compared with those recruited via the diagnostic laboratory (5/18; 28%), likely a consequence of more rigorous clinical selection and inclusion of sequencing data from a greater number of additional family members in these cases; however, the difference was not significant (one-tailed p=0.19). A positive diagnosis was obtained in a higher proportion of families in which multiple individuals were sequenced (6/14; 43%) than when singletons were sequenced (9/26; 35%), but this difference was also not significant.

ES identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.1330G&#x0003e;T; p.Gly444*) in <italic>NTRK2</italic>, encoding neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, type 2, with a predicted loss of the entire intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The proband's mother did not carry the mutation and the father was not available for analysis. Dominant mutations of <italic>NTRK2</italic> have been described in association with hyperphagic obesity associated with developmental delay (OBHD), and functional studies have pointed to haploinsufficiency as the likely pathogenic mechanism of disease associated with a previously identified p.Tyr722Cys substitution.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>The discovery of the <italic>NTRK2</italic> mutation prompted a further endocrinology assessment at the age of 7&#x02005;years 6&#x02005;months. Her height was 135.2&#x02005;cm (+2.04 SD), weight 46.2&#x02005;kg (+3.19 SD) and body mass index 25.3&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (+3.1 SD), consistent with a diagnosis of OBHD. She was noted to have a long-standing history of hyperphagia. The oral glucose tolerance test was normal; streak ovaries and uterus were evident on ultrasound scan. Management implications have included referral to a clinical psychologist and dietitian to address her eating behaviours, and regular monitoring for secondary complications including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present, to our knowledge, the first investigation of the added value provided by ES or WGS in molecular genetic diagnosis of craniosynostosis, applied to two cohorts of patients (total of 40) identified as high-priority cases by clinical or laboratory geneticists following negative results from routine molecular genetic testing. We identified 13 mutations in 12 confirmed disease genes that we considered to be pathogenic. Seven of the particular DNA sequence changes found were previously reported, whereas an additional six are currently unique to the patients described here. The newly identified variants were considered pathogenic using evidence from population MAF data, predictive computational data and studies of aberrant function (either performed ourselves or published in the literature), according to guidelines from the Association for Clinical Genetic Science.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In addition, we identified at least two likely novel disease-associated genes; further studies to corroborate these findings are ongoing, so details are not presented here. Including these latter cases, our overall success rate in identifying pathogenic mutations was 15/40 (37.5%), which is towards the upper end of the range usually quoted in ES/WGS analysis of other diseases with a major genetic component.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> We used a mixed strategy of sequencing both singletons and multiple family members; the latter strategy was associated with a higher success rate per family, but the former with a 2.3-fold higher success rate per sample sequenced. Although trio sequencing is the favoured design in many other ES/WGS studies because complete bioinformatic analysis of the data is more straightforward,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> singleton sequencing appears more cost-effective in a diagnostic setting.</p><p>Craniosynostosis comprises a very diverse group of disorders and its causes are correspondingly heterogeneous, with intrauterine fetal head constraint, reduced transduction of stretch forces from the growing brain owing to poor intrinsic growth, and polygenic background all likely to play substantial roles, in addition to monogenic causes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Since a major motivation of this work was to use NGS to identify novel disease genes in craniosynostosis, we selected cases suspected to have a genetic cause, based on positive family history, presence of additional syndromic features or multiple suture fusions, and for which clinically guided genetic testing had been normal. Although this strategy was successful, with at least four newly recognised disease genes for craniosynostosis being identified as part of this study (<italic>CDC4</italic>5<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and <italic>HUWE1</italic>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and two awaiting further corroboration), the major finding presented here is that NGS is very valuable for diagnosis of a long &#x02018;tail&#x02019; of rare genetic associations with craniosynostosis. All of these positive diagnoses have made a critical difference to genetic counselling, with some having broader management implications.</p><p>To understand why a genetic diagnosis in craniosynostosis may elude standard molecular diagnostic testing, we categorised each additional diagnosis in terms of the molecular genetic framework recently presented by Twigg and Wilkie.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These authors identified 57 genes as recurrently mutated in craniosynostosis, of which they categorised 20 as &#x02018;core genes&#x02019; (craniosynostosis present in &#x0003e;50% of patients with specific categories of mutation in that gene), while mutations in the remaining 37 genes were associated with craniosynostosis in only a minority of cases. The core genes could be further subdivided into six with mutations each accounting for &#x0003e;0.5% of all craniosynostosis and 14 more rarely mutated genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104215F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> summarises how the 13 identified mutations are classified according to this framework. While, not surprisingly, the number of mutations identified, as a proportion of total genes in the category, rose progressively as the pathogenic hierarchy was ascended, there were multiple genes in each category. This includes two genes (<italic>NTRK2, AHDC1</italic>), for which we are unaware of any previous association with craniosynostosis; it is unclear whether the co-occurrence of the mutation and sentinel phenotype is causally linked (potentially through the adverse effect of the mutation on brain development)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> or simply coincidental.</p><fig id="JMEDGENET2016104215F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Identified mutations and their association within the classification of craniosynostosis-associated genes proposed by Twigg and Wilkie.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmedgenet-2016-104215f02"/></fig><p>In the cases found to have mutations in the &#x02018;core&#x02019; genes, the question arises why these were not identified by testing within the routine diagnostic service. In the patients with <italic>EFNB1</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> mutations, the diagnosis was missed because analysis of the relevant gene had not been requested by the clinician; either because of an unusually mild presentation (<italic>EFNB1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104215F1">figure 1</xref>B) or a severe, atypical presentation (<italic>TWIST1</italic>). Of the other core genes, homozygous mutations in <italic>IL11RA</italic>, first described in 2011,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> are increasingly recognised, especially in consanguineous families from the Indian subcontinent, and clinical diagnostic testing has now been introduced in the UK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ukgtn.nhs.uk/uploads/tx_ukgtn/CRSDA_IL11RA_GD_Sept_14.pdf">http://ukgtn.nhs.uk/uploads/tx_ukgtn/CRSDA_IL11RA_GD_Sept_14.pdf</ext-link>). Although a specific heterozygous mutation of <italic>MSX2</italic> encoding Pro148His was the first molecular lesion to be described in craniosynostosis in 1993,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> only two further families (both segregating p.Pro148Leu) have subsequently been reported worldwide,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and the family described here (also with p.Pro148Leu) is the first known in the UK. Finally, the <italic>CDC45</italic> patient contributed to the recent identification of mutations in this gene,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and the patient with the <italic>ZIC1</italic> mutation extends the currently described genotype&#x02013;phenotype correlation,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> being the first with a mutation in exon 2 and also the first with involvement of the sagittal suture instead of the originally described presentation with bilateral coronal synostosis.</p><p>As in any branch of genetic medicine, achieving a precise molecular diagnosis has immediate implications for genetic counselling, both in terms of recurrence risk and for targeted preventive measures. The common craniosynostosis syndromes all show dominant patterns of inheritance, so that when parents are clinically unaffected, empiric recurrence risks are low (around 5%).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Our cohort illustrates two scenarios where providing the standard genetic advice would substantially underestimate recurrence risks. In family 25 (<italic>EFNB1</italic> mutation), the clinically unaffected father was shown to be hemizygous for the mutation originally identified in his daughter, indicating that the risk of CFNS in future female children is 100%. In family 3 (<italic>CDC45</italic> mutation), the autosomal-recessive inheritance of this disorder raises the recurrence risk for children of the unaffected parents to 25%. Both findings have affected reproductive decision-making; one family is seeking PIGD, whereas in the other, the option not to have further children is being considered.</p><p>In addition to the genetic implications, in several cases (mutations in the <italic>FBN1</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NTRK2</italic> and <italic>STAT3</italic> genes), the molecular diagnosis has had immediate implications for clinical management, as described in the case reports, so genetic diagnosis was additionally important. Mutations in each of these genes are only infrequently associated with craniosynostosis; indeed, the presence of the craniosynostosis may have delayed correct diagnosis by laying a confusing trail. As a result of the molecular diagnosis, appropriate, potentially life-saving monitoring has been instigated. The high apparent rate of rare actionable mutations identified in complex craniosynostosis without an obvious diagnosis may reflect developmental pleiotropy of signalling in the cranial sutures, with multiple pathways, co-opted from more ancient uses in embryogenesis, implicated at different stages of suture development.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In summary, our findings illustrate the considerable added value provided by ES/WGS to the precise diagnosis of patients with craniosynostosis suspected to have a genetic cause, but where routine testing has failed to elucidate this. As technologies improve, a strategic question in molecular diagnostics is whether it is preferable to extend panel tests to more genes or whether to opt directly for ES/WGS. Aside from the most common disease-associated mutations, for which targeted testing currently remains cost-effective, we propose, based on the distribution of mutations identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104215F2">figure 2</xref>), together with the substantial burden of actionable findings (case reports), a low threshold for implementing ES/WGS. An additional benefit of this strategy is that it may identify new disease loci,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
