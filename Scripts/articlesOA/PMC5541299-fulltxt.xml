Logistic regression models will test the hypothesis that there are more cardiovascular events in enrolled patients with a low level of vitamin D (&#x0003c; 50&#x02005;nmol/L).

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Also, myocytes and cells of the vessel walls contain vitamin D receptor and enzymes essential for vitamin D metabolism, and low levels of vitamin D are associated with several cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In non-RA subjects, epidemiological studies consistently show significant associations between low vitamin D levels and increased cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref> Atherosclerosis has become accepted as an inflammatory state,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> and the main proinflammatory cytokines involved in the atherosclerotic process, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1;,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> are also pivotal in RA.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

These are considered below.</p><p>Patients with RA are often obese or have an altered body composition.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In those with a low or normal body mass index (BMI), rheumatoid cachexia (low muscle mass, high fat mass) may be present,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> leading to an altered distribution of body fat and muscle mass; obesity and altered body composition are also obvious cardiovascular risk factors. Vitamin D sequesters in fatty tissue, and high fat mass, can thereby lead to lower levels of circulating bioavailable vitamin D.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a sedentary lifestyle,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> often due to lack of sun exposure and thereby cutaneous vitamin D production during ultraviolet B radiation. Patients with RA, especially those with active disease and high disability, often have a sedentary, indoor lifestyle, thereby increasing the probability of having lower vitamin D levels.</p><p>Smoking is a well-known risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> one of the main-steps in the development of cardiovascular disease. Smoking can also be a part of the pathogenesis in RA, where it leads to early citrullination, and thereby, production of autoantibodies.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In non-RA subjects, smoking is associated with lower levels of vitamin D than found in matched non-smokers.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref></p><p>Patients with RA often have the &#x02018;lipid paradox&#x02019;&#x02014;that is, low levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein, but a remaining high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Likewise, in patients with RA, an inverse association has been observed between vitamin D levels and LDL,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> indicating that vitamin D might be associated with known cardiovascular risk factors in patients with RA.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47&#x02013;49</xref></p><p>Other comorbidities in RA, such as insulin resistance,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> hypertension<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and metabolic syndrome,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> are highly prevalent, and similarly, low levels of vitamin D are linked to these comorbidities,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> which are all known to be individual risk factors of CVD.</p><p>An eventual aetiological role of low vitamin D levels in the development of CVD is important, as it is potentially remediable.

<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79&#x02013;81</xref> We find the assumption of a 40% prevalence of low vitamin D levels in our cohort reasonable. Originally, our study protocol aimed to evaluate cardiovascular death as the primary outcome, but we learnt that there were only 11 deaths in the cohort during the first 10&#x02005;years of follow-up. Therefore, we agreed to use &#x02018;any cardiovascular event&#x02019; as primary outcome,<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> to enable the study to have sufficient statistical power. The authors and the working group have no knowledge about cardiovascular events in the study before the journal adjudication. Moreover, to achieve a substantially greater power, by probably implicating more events, we have extended the follow-up period from the originally planned 10&#x02005;years after inclusion (October 2009&#x02014;October 2012) to the 10th of October 2016, thereby following up the patients for up to 17&#x02005;years. In a recent meta-analysis in 41&#x02005;490 patients, the pooled hazard ratio for any incident cardiovascular event in patients with RA was 1.48, compared with non-RA-patients.<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> For non-RA patients, two meta-analyses of cardiovascular disease in relation to vitamin D levels have recently been published.

We are not aware of any other studies of associations between risk of cardiovascular death and low vitamin D levels in patients with RA, and therefore the main limitation of the power calculation is the assumptions on which it is based.

Differences between numbers of cardiovascular events in the two D<sub>total</sub> groups will be analysed using the log-rank test.</p><p>Following simple logistic regression analysis, some of the variables collected at baseline will probably be statistically significantly associated with the CVD events. Thus we will use a multivariable logistic regression, enabling two or more independent variables in the model&#x02014;that is, simultaneously adjusting for more than one factor that has an impact on the outcome. The relationship between the outcome and the potential confounding variables gender, age, smoking status, BMI &#x02265; 30, ACPA positivity at baseline, antihypertensive treatment initiated after inclusion and statin treatment initiated after inclusion will be explored in further sensitivity analyses, using multivariable logistic regression modelling. Those variables were chosen because of their well-known association with CVD.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Missing outcome data</title><p>The adjudication strategy using data from patient journals might introduce some inconsistencies in the final diagnosis, and thereby misclassification of the primary outcome. Though, we will aim to counteract this, by consulting the third member of the adjudication group in any cases of disagreement.</p><p>Missing values represent a potential source of bias, and therefore every effort will be undertaken to ensure sufficient follow-up. There are no missing D<sub>total</sub> levels at baseline (Herly M, 2010, abstract only), but we expect that the collection of journal data for cardiovascular events or hospitalisation might be insufficient, mainly because participants may move to another region in Denmark. There might be sociodemographic differences in patients moving from one region to another, but we do not expect changes in these characteristics to be so different that they will markedly change the estimates. Moreover, Denmark is a small country, with a relatively homogeneous population, and equal access to all types of health services, further minimising the risk of regional differences in prevention and registration of health outcomes. We will collect follow-up data concerning hospitalisation in all patients moving to one of the other regions where we have access to patient records, to minimise the amount of data missing.</p><p>If outcome data are missing, we assume that they will be missing at random, and therefore, data missing before the patient has had an event, will not bias the estimates toward a stronger association, but solely underestimate the event rate, and thereby the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation in the cohort. If data are missing after the first cardiovascular event, the primary outcome; first cardiovascular event, will be evaluated as specified in the primary analyses.</p><p>Data concerning events after patients are lost to follow-up can also be handled as &#x02018;last observation carried forward&#x02019;. For a patient moving to another region, the last observation will be that the patient is alive when lost to follow-up. This will possibly lead to an overestimation of the survival in the cohort, and an underestimation of the risk of hospitalisation, and ultimately, number of deaths, thereby diminishing the size of the final estimate towards &#x02018;no association&#x02019;.</p><p>To further evaluate the extent of missing data, and especially the assumption of data missing at random, we will quantify the number of patient-years in the two vitamin D groups.</p><p>When data are incomplete at the end point, we will perform sensitivity analyses based on an imputation of missing values, using two different approaches:

This is a crucial strength, as we would be unable to use a better experimental design owing to ethical constraints (ie, it is not possible to randomise to low vitamin D). Keeping this in mind, one drawback of observational studies is that they lack the ability to randomise their participants into treatment groups&#x02014; that is, there is a chance that we infer from selection bias and confounding by indication. One way to adjust for this is through the use of a propensity score analysis. For this analysis, an adjustment will be performed through various forms of propensity scoring (including stratification, matching and regression adjustment). Each form is separately conducted, reviewed and assessed for its effectiveness in improving the model.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Potential limitations</title><p>Instead of being part of the pathogenesis in several diseases, vitamin D might merely be a marker of poor lifestyle,<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>

Therefore, a patient initially evaluated as having low vitamin D levels at baseline, will presumably achieve normal levels during the follow-up. If causality between low vitamin D levels and development of CVD exists, such patients might be &#x02018;misclassified&#x02019;, thereby leading an eventual association towards null. Though, we still find it relevant to evaluate if baseline vitamin D levels can predict long-term cardiovascular outcomes, despite &#x02018;blurring&#x02019; the results by substitution. We recommend all rheumatologists to substitute their patients with RA with vitamin D and calcium,&#x000a0;both because it is known that low vitamin D levels are common in these patients, and as prophylactic treatment for osteoporosis. However, we also acknowledge that the substitution strategy in our cohort might diminish the comparability with studies not using vitamin D and calcium substitution.</p><p>A profound association between D<sub>total</sub> level and other cardiovascular risk factors may confound the association between baseline D<sub>total</sub> and cardiovascular mortality. To date, associations between vitamin D levels and several cardiovascular risk factors are well established, as mentioned in the introduction, and many of those risk factors are also associated with low vitamin D levels.</p><p>In general, it seems that associations between vitamin D, RA and CVD are part of an extremely delicate interplay, challenging clarification of causality, and increasing the risk of confounding.</p><p>Despite our attempts to handle these confounders, the study lacks baseline data, such as markers of early atherosclerosis, body composition, insulin resistance and sedentary lifestyle, leading to potential residual confounding. Most of this major limitation is due to the study design, with use of secondary analyses from a prior randomised controlled trial, with no influence on the variables collected at the time of inclusion. Those limitations are regrettable, but we attempt to deal with them in the discussion section of the final paper. We accept those limitations, because the use of a cohort established at the millennium has the advantages of long-term follow-up, and therefore probably an &#x02018;acceptable&#x02019; amount of cardiovascular events during this follow-up. Moreover, despite potential confounders, we still find that the study design is appropriate for evaluating if low vitamin D levels at baseline can predict long-term CVD in a cohort of patients with RA treated-to-target and receiving relevant anti-osteoporotic treatment according to National Guidelines.</p><p>Using a previously designed cohort provides the advantage of long-term follow-up, but also has some major limitations due to the study design&#x02014;for example, the exclusion criteria; diastolic blood pressure &#x0003e; 90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg excludes some patients with a great risk of cardiovascular disease, and may therefore bias the results towards fewer incident cardiovascular events. Neither is there information about lipid status, and therefore we cannot adjust for this well-known confounder.

<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89&#x02013;91</xref> is likely, as vitamin D is a marker of generally poor lifestyle.

Additionally, although the eligibility criteria led to selection of patients with RA with few comorbidities at baseline, the long-term follow-up leads to generalisability of the results.</p><p>Like the present cohort, many other RA cohorts are strictly selected to avoid comorbidity, and long-term follow-up studies in RA cohorts with several comorbidities are needed.

<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref> The two methods of classification in patients with RA could be compared, which would indicate the accuracy of the register-based outcome evaluation for CVD in patients with RA.</p><p>This study will be a cohort study, and causality underlying an eventual association on the effect of vitamin D in CVD in patients with RA needs to be evaluated in future studies, preferably in randomised controlled trials, measuring the effect on cardiovascular outcomes of varying sufficiently high doses of vitamin D supplements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>All patients received verbal and written information before enrolment, and gave written consent at baseline.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The supplemental protocol, which reported cardiovascular events from the medical records in all 160 patients from the original CIMESTRA protocol, NCT00209859 (registered 16 September 2005), is approved by the Danish Health Authority and the Danish Medicines Agency (3&#x02013;3013&#x02013;930/1/ 10-year patient-record adjudication, approved 24 April 2015, extension of follow-up to 10 October 2016, approved 10 October 2016) as well as the Danish Data Protection Agency (2008&#x02013;58&#x02013;0035, approved 23 April 2015). Principal investigators in the original study were Kim H&#x000f8;rslev-Petersen, Merete Lund Hetland and Kristian-Stengaard Pedersen. This study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT02932644, 12 October 2016.</p><p>To disseminate understanding of factors that can predict cardiovascular outcome in RA, we will attempt to have a first draft ready no later than 1&#x02005;year after the adjudication process has finished. There are gaps in knowledge concerning prediction of CVD in RA, and despite great scientific activity in the field of vitamin D and RA, there are also disparities in this area. If our hypothesis that low vitamin D levels can predict cardiovascular events in RA, no matter if vitamin D is part of the causality, or just a marker of &#x02018;poor lifestyle&#x02019;, it is relevant to take this into account in a prediction model, to be considered by patients, physicians and health politicians. Moreover, it will be important to further investigate if vitamin D supplementation can alter the risk of cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e319" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014816.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e320" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-014816.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed to conception and design, data acquisition or analysis and interpretation of data, and took part in drafting or revising the article.
