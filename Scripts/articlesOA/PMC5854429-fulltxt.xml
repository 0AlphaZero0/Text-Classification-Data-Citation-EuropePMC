The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, however, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although this unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details of the process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. A free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. This simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelicdal turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. At one end of the DNA, the first five bps unwrap, after which a second five bps unwrap at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 bps are unwrapped. During further unwrapping of 15 bps, the unwrapping advances at one of the ends, after which the other end of the DNA unwraps to complete the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The eukaryotic genome is compactly packaged into the cell nucleus. Within the nucleus, DNA forms protein-DNA complexes called nucleosomes. The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of chromatin. It is composed of a histone octamer around which DNA wraps about twice. During cellular processes such as DNA transcription, replication and repair, the DNA must be unwrapped from the structure. This unwrapping has been investigated experimentally, but details of the process at the atomic level are not yet well understood. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations using an enhanced sampling method to obtain free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of the nucleosomal DNA. Our analysis shows that some energy cost is required to unwrap the first 5 bps at one end of the DNA, after which a second 5 bps unwrap with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA for up to 10 bps. In this way, DNA unwrapping occurs asymmetrically from one end. These findings provide insight into how DNA dynamics are related to gene regulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (JP)</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP25116003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-8707</contrib-id><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Hidetoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>MEXT</institution></funding-source><award-id>hp120309, hp130003, hp140029, hp150233, hp160223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-8707</contrib-id><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Hidetoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research has been funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Strategic Programs for Innovative Research, Computational Life Science and Application in Drug Discovery and Medical Development (hp120309, hp130003, hp140029, hp150233, hp160223) and by JSPS KAKENHI(No. JP25116003).

Its crystal structure revealed that within the nucleosome, 146 or 147 bps of DNA wrap 1.75 times around an octameric histone core [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, for proper gene function, such as transcription, duplication and repair, this nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, at least partially.</p><p>Single-molecule experiments showed that the energetics of protein-DNA interactions depend to varying degrees on the protein-DNA contact positions. FRET experiments[<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that in the absence of salt, the outer superhelical turn of DNA (hereinafter referred to as &#x0201c;outer DNA&#x0201d;) within the nucleosome repeats spontaneously and repeatedly unwrapping and rewrapping. Rewrapping is about 5 times faster than unwrrapping, which is within about 10 to 50 ms [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Single-molecule experiments in which the two ends of the DNA in a nucleosomal array [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or individual nucleosome [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are mechanically pulled in opposite directions demonstrated that the outer DNA is more easily unwrapped than the inner super-helical turn. Later, after performing a DNA unzipping experiment, Wang&#x02019;s group reported the energetics of histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This single molecule experiment showed that distinct histone-DNA interactions occur at intervals of about five bps, indicating that the two phosphate backbones of double-stranded DNA interact independently with the histones. It is difficult, however, to determine at the atomic level details such as which interaction is lost first during unwrapping and then second and so on.</p><p>All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided detailed information about the dynamics of the nucleosome [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ettig et al. were the first to carry out all-atom MD simulations of the nucleosome to investigate unwrapping energetics [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Gribkova et al. calculated histone-DNA binding energies with a concept similar to this study [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with the unzipping experiment, Ettig et al. observed a 5-bp periodicity. However, because of the limited amount of time that could be computationally processed, a large force was imposed on the DNA during the unwrapping process, which caused unrealistic distortion of the DNA and histones.</p><p>Coarse-grained MD is an attractive method because it enables processing time spans not achievable in all-atom simulations using current state-of-the-art computer systems. Kenzaki and Takada performed a coarse-grained MD simulation that captured residue-level structural details, and exhibited spontaneous unwrapping and rewrapping of the outer DNA [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, their simulation showed that the unwrapping is mostly asymmetric, with one end unwrapping while the other end remains wrapped. Using a similar coarse-grained model, Lequieu et al. calculated the tension-dependent free energy surface and found that the contributions of histone tails to DNA stability differed between the H3/H4 and H2A/B tails [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whereas H3/H4 contributes more to the stability of the outer DNA, H2A/B stabilizes the inner DNA. The results of these simulations are consistent with the experimental findings [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, coarse-grained MD requires adjustable parameters for the target of interest and is still less reliable in dynamics than all-atom simulations with an explicit solvent model due to the nature of the simplification.</p><p>Here, we carried out MD simulations with an enhanced sampling method to obtain conformational ensembles. We report the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer-turn of nucleosomal DNA. The obtained profiles based on the ensembles show that unwrapping of the outer-turn costs about 11.5 kcal/mol. Comparison of the numbers of unwrapped base pairs at the two ends of the DNA shows that the unwrapping occurs asymmetrically, though the nucleosome has a pseudo-symmetric structure and a symmetric DNA sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>We carried out simulations of unwrapping outer superhelical turn DNA (outer DNA) to obtain the free energy profiles. Here, we define &#x0201c;outer DNA&#x0201d; as the DNA regions extending from one end to a position 10 bps from the off-dyad position: &#x02212;73 to &#x02212;48 and +48 to +73 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g001">Fig 1</xref>, stage 1 plus stage 2). Crystal structures show that the histone core has 14 separate DNA binding domains [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this study, we unwrapped 25 bps of DNA from each end (50 bps in total), which corresponds to a loss of interaction with four DNA binding domains, two from each of end of the DNA. In these unwrapping simulations, we divided the unwrapping into two stages: stage 1, &#x02212;73 to &#x02212;58 and stage 2, &#x02212;63 to &#x02212;48. The initial structures for stage 2 were prepared by deleting 10 bps from each end of the DNA. This reduced the computational cost by making the simulation size smaller.</p><fig id="pcbi.1006024.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006024.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The initial and final conformations in the outer DNA unwrapping simulations.</title><p>Shown are DNA numbering and unwrapped DNA regions in stages 1 (a) and 2 (b).

A &#x0201c;flooding time&#x0201d; &#x003c4; determines how fast the current position is destabilized. A larger drop of biasing energy given by a smaller flooding time can save computational time because energy wells along the reaction coordinate are filled faster. However, a short flooding time, for instance &#x003c4; = 1 ps, often corrupted the dsDNA structure of the nucleosomal DNA. We tested three &#x003c4; values, 1, 10 and 100 ps, with 100 walkers and found that 10 ps was mostly acceptable from a structural point of view. However, to further ensure proper dsDNA structure was maintained, we set &#x003c4; to 100 ps. Note that the flooding time, &#x003c4; value has to be determined considering the total number of walkers used in ABMD simulation because the total energy dropped during the simulation is proportional to the product of 1/&#x003c4; and the total number of walkers. With this &#x003c4; value, ABMD simulations with 100 walkers were carried out for 15 ns (1.5 ms in total), until the dropped energy converged at every point over the entire range of the reaction coordinate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s001">S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s002">S2A</xref> Figs).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, end-to-end distance takes a wide range of values (90 to 180 &#x000c5;) at 20 bps in total unwrapped bp, and a free energy minimum is located around 130 &#x000c5;, at which the slope of free energy curve sharply increases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Since unwrapping simulation in stage 2 starts with 20 bps shorter DNA than that of stage 1, the slope of the free energy curve at the beginning in stage 2 was expected to be similar to that of stage 1 after 130 &#x000c5;. However, the slope of stage 1 was nearly two times larger than that of stage 2. Then, to check DNA conformation, we calculated base pair and base step parameters of 10 bps from both ends for the 15 ns trajectories of the umbrella samplings using X3DNA[<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and tabulated them in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s006">S1</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s009">S4</xref> Tables for stage 1 and S5 to S8 for stage 2.

However, &#x0201c;roll&#x0201d; of CG started to decrease and &#x0201c;rise&#x0201d; of TA started to increase at 130 &#x000c5; in end-to-end distance in stage 1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s008">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s009">S4</xref> Tables), indicating that some of energy was used for DNA bending or stretching rather than for unwrapping. This indicates that a longer time would be necessary for relaxing the stress in the DNA bending and further unwrapping. Therefore, we did not consider data for unwrapping more than 20 bps.</p><p>During stage 2, the free energy decreased with unwrapping the first five bps, which corresponds to 20&#x02013;25 bp in stage 1, probably because unfavorable stresses in DNA were relaxed. This is another reason we stopped the unwrapping analysis at 20 bp in stage 1. The energy then gradually increased until a total of 17 bps were unwrapped. There are two small gaps between 13 and 14 bps and between 17 and 21 bps. After those points, four bps were unwrapped from the histone core without cost. The free energy started to increase again at 25 bps, reaching 6 kcal/mol, after which we again observed a sharp increase in free energy. This position indeed corresponds to an end-to-end distance of about 160 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), which is consistent with a position where the slope showed a sharp increase in the free energy as a function of end-to-end distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, a minimum in free energy at 25 total unwrapped bp is around 160 &#x000c5; in end-to-end distance.

To check this possibility, we calculated the root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the initial conformations of the two DNA endpoints using heavy atoms on each of the 100 structures for stage 1. In the calculation, considered were 15 bps from the end of the DNA and a part of the histone core close to the DNA (13 residues from H3, 10 residues from H2A and 19 residues from H2B). The averaged rmsd value and standard deviation over 100 initial structures for stage 1 of ABMD which were obtained 100 ns long MD simulation are 2.70 &#x000c5; and 0.65 &#x000c5;, respectively. When only the DNA is considered, the corresponding values are 2.80 &#x000c5; and 0.58 &#x000c5;, respectively. These rmsd values are comparable with fluctuation of P atoms observed in the 100 ns MD simulation of the canonical nucleosome which maintained both DNA ends wrapped around the histone [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, we consider that the initial conformations still maintain a pseudo-symmetric structure and the asymmetric unwrapping comes from the nature of stochastic process.</p><p>During stage 2, the asymmetry of the unwrapping was clearly observed as unwrapping at one end advanced up to 15 bps before the other end started to unwrap.

In each stage, we observed unusual DNA stretch at longer end-to-end distances in ABMD simulations and therefore excluding those regions before the umbrella samplings. After checking the DNA conformations obtained by the umbrella samplings, we estimated the free energy cost of unwrapping a total of 44 bps, which corresponds to nearly the entire outer DNA, to be about 11.5 kcal/mol (5.5 kcal/mol in stage 1 and 6 kcal/mol in stage 2). The full unwrapping free energy has been estimated about 40 kcal/mol using an integrating model of a coarse-grain and fine-grain models[<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or a theoretical model [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The calculated cost of 11.5 kcal/mol for unwrapping 44 bps in this study is about a quarter of the cost for the full unwrapping, indicating the obtained value is quite reasonable compared with the reported values. The corresponding free energy value obtained by experiments ranges about 5 to 12 kcal/mol [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which likely depends on interpretation of the experimental results.</p><p>Because DNA unwrapping starts at one of the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g006">Fig 6</xref>), gaps in the free energy curves are well explained by the loss of interaction between the DNA and histones. However, there is a discrepancy between our model and a previous model [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Forties et al. proposed a quantitative theoretical model of DNA unwrapping and disassociation from the histone octamer [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. By calibrating the model to a high-resolution nucleosome unzipping experiment [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], they successfully explained the differences in the rate of nucleosome disassembly caused by hMSH2-hMSH6 between two DNA sequences and between histone modification states. In their model, free energy increases stepwise as unwrapping advances, which is consistent with our findings. However, they found that the cost to unwrap 20 bps was about 1 k<sub>B</sub>T, which is 10 times smaller than our calculated value. Most likely, this discrepancy arises from the following differences. First, unwrapping and rewrapping rates are highly dependent on the salt concentration [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Second, in the simulation, we counted the number of unwrapped bps from both DNA ends. In the unzipping experiment, by contrast, the model building always occurred from one DNA end. Third, the definition of unwrapping is context dependent. They assumed that the number of broken base pairs equals the number of base pairs unwrapped from the nucleosome; however, it is quite possible that there is a gap in time between the unwrapping and the dissociation, which would lead to the observed small free energy for unwrapping 20 bps.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Key residues in the DNA interaction</title><p>In an alanine mutation experiment, Ferreira et al. showed that each residue within the H3 &#x003b1;N helix revealed different aspects of nucleosome dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We found that the measured effects on DNA wrapping (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006024.s006">S1 Table</xref> in the reference) are well correlated with the contact ratio between the protein and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006024.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). For example, R49A caused the largest decrease in the FRET ratio between the two DNA ends, followed by R52 and R53. Mutation of V46, L48 or K56 had a moderate effect. This trend is in good agreement with the contact ratios observed in the present study and in our earlier MD study [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which indicates these residues are directly involved in protein-DNA interaction to stabilize the nucleosome. Interestingly, alanine mutation of L48 or Q55, which have little or no direct contact with DNA, destabilized histone octamer formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Most likely, these mutations destabilize the H3 &#x003b1;N helix causing favorable protein-DNA interactions to be lost. Thus, these residues are well conserved among eukaryotes.</p><p>During stage 2, we observed that T76 and R77 of H2A and Y39 and K43 of H2B gradually lose direct hydrogen bonds to the DNA.

This treatment has a possibility of underestimating the unwrapping free energy of mono-nucleosome though the tails have more important role in inter-nucleosome interaction as discussed below.</p><p>Histone tails are known to mediate interactions between nucleosomes, enabling them to fold into the chromatin solenoid [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], or they may mediate nucleosome assembly [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In particular, H4 tails probably play the most important role in inter-nucleosome interaction. All atom MD simulations by Langwoski&#x02019;s group showed that H4K16 acetylation drastically reduces H4 tail-acidic patch of the stacked nucleosome and increases the tail conformational diversity [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

These results indicate the impact of post-translational modification to chromatin conformation.</p><p>At mono-nucleosome level, what is the role of tails? At least in terms of thermodynamic view, thermal stability of the entire nucleosome changes little with or without the tails at mono-nucleosome level.

For instance, in a single molecule study, Brower-Toland et al. showed that tail truncation reduces the overall affinity of histones for outer DNA [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, in SAXS and FRET experiments, Andersen et al. showed that truncation of the H3 or H4 tail has opposite effects. In their FRET studies, whereas H3 truncation induces dissociation of DNA, H4 truncation stabilizes the wrapped conformation to a greater degree than the intact nucleosome [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When Biswas et al. used all-atom MD simulations to examine nucleosome dynamics with and without the histone tails, they found that tail truncation destabilized the histone core [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consistent with that finding, using an implicit solvent model, Erler et al. found that attractive interactions between positively charged Lys and Arg residues in the histone tails and negatively charged phosphate groups in the DNA stabilized the nucleosome structure [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, a MD simulation carried out by one of the authors showed that the H3 N-terminal tail and H2A C-terminal tail both interact with linker DNA [<xref rid="pcbi.1006024.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and that the latter stabilizes the closed form of the linker DNA.
