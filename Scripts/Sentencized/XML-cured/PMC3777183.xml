<SENT sid="14780" pm="."><plain>The cause of these degenerate changes is multifactorial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14781" pm="."><plain>It is based on genetics and influenced by lifestyle and injuries [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14782" pm="."><plain>To maximize musculoskeletal health regular exercise [5], proper diet [6] and maintenance of an appropriate body weight are recommended [7]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14785" pm="."><plain>They carry heavy loads on their backs and march and run long distances over varied terrain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14786" pm="."><plain>They represent a population whose musculoskeletal system is subjected to extremely high and sustained loading [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14787" pm="."><plain>According to the Atlas of Injuries in the US Armed Forces [9], musculoskeletal (orthopedic) conditions are the leading cause of disability for all three services: army (53%), navy and marine corps (63%), and air force (22%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14788" pm="."><plain>No specific data is available for elite infantry soldiers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14789" pm="."><plain>We undertook a comparison study of the effect of the extremes of very high versus very low sustained musculoskeletal loading beginning at a young age on the musculoskeletal health of the lower back and knees at middle age using MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14790" pm="."><plain>We compared a group of elite infantry soldiers who were under surveillance since the beginning of their military training in 1983 [8] with a group of full time Torah scholars who were deferred from military service at the same time and maintained a sedentary lifestyle since then. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14857" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six soldiers from the 1983 induction group were contacted by phone by the study's senior author who was one of their army physicians in 1983. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14860" pm="."><plain>Twenty soldiers and 17 Torah scholars had both maternal and paternal Ashkenazi origins.

<SENT sid="14865" pm="."><plain>This difference was mostly due to a greater participation in sport activities by the soldiers (P = 0.001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14866" pm="."><plain>Generally, the Torah scholars avoided participation in sport as can be seen from a compendium of their continuous sport activity for the previous five years (Table 5), considering it a waste of valuable study time. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14881" pm="."><plain>The study shows that very high skeletal loading did result in an increase in lumbar disk degeneration as assessed by the Pfirrmann score [11] but not degenerative knee changes as assessed by the WORMS score [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14882" pm="."><plain>Over the past 25 years, soldiers from the 1983 study had a significantly greater incidence of back problems, requiring changes in their health profiles than knee problems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14883" pm="."><plain>The extremely physically active group in this study was composed of former elite infantry soldiers who were subjects in a 1983 prospective study of stress fractures [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14884" pm="."><plain>Their training was so physically demanding that 31 percent were found to have sustained stress fractures during basic training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14885" pm="."><plain>The sedentary group in this study was composed of Torah scholars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14886" pm="."><plain>They had the same military health profiles when they were 18 years old as the elite infantry soldiers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14887" pm="."><plain>Instead of doing military service, they received deferment and continued to study Torah. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14888" pm="."><plain>The extent of their physical activity was usually limited to walking to their place of study and domestic activities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14889" pm="."><plain>During the three years of compulsory military service, the soldiers marched long distances over difficult terrain carrying heavy loads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14890" pm="."><plain>These loads were not supposed to exceed 40% of their body weight but often exceeded 50% of their body weights. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14891" pm="."><plain>During this same period, the Torah scholars sat long hours studying. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14892" pm="."><plain>After completing three or more years of regular army service, the soldiers continued to serve a month each year in reserve infantry units until the age of forty. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14894" pm="."><plain>The great difference in the physical activity levels between the groups continued until the time of the 25-year review done in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14895" pm="."><plain>The mean daily energy expenditure of the soldiers was a third higher than that of the Torah scholars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14896" pm="."><plain>Most of this difference was because few Torah scholars participated in any sport or exercise activities other than walking to their place of study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14897" pm="."><plain>The former elite infantry soldiers continued to do endurance sports such a running, mountain and road biking, and basketball. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14900" pm="."><plain>Recent genetic studies have shown that these two populations are closely genetically related [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14901" pm="."><plain>Because both groups in this study also had similar body weights and smoking histories, the study is an effective model for studying the single variable of the effect of extremes in physical lifestyle on the health of the lumbar spine and knees in middle age. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14940" pm="."><plain>There are several possible explanations for the greater long term resilience of the meniscus compared to that of the lumbar disks found in this study among the high loading group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14941" pm="."><plain>One is that the heavy back packs carried by the soldiers in many of their activities repetitively placed higher stresses on the lumbar intervertebral disks than on the meniscus and thereby led to increased fatigue failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14942" pm="."><plain>Another explanation is that the meniscus may have better fatigue failure characteristics at repetitive high loading than the lumbar intervertebral disk. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14945" pm="."><plain>This study compares the effect of extreme physical activities with an inactive life style on knees and the lower back at middle age using elite infantry soldier and Torah scholar cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14946" pm="."><plain>From an engineering stand point, this represents a test of very high versus very low sustained loading on these structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14947" pm="."><plain>The strength of the study is the uniform genetic backgrounds of the subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14948" pm="."><plain>The main study limitation is the relatively small number of subjects in each of the two study cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14949" pm="."><plain>Even with this limitation, statistically significant higher lumbar disk degeneration was found in the elite infantry cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14950" pm="."><plain>In spite of the extreme differences in the musculoskeletal loading between the cohorts, there was surprisingly little difference found by MRI criteria, in the amount of degenerative changes in both their knees and lumbar spines at middle age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14951" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that the knee may possibly be more resilient to sustained heavy loading than are lumbar disks. </plain></SENT>
