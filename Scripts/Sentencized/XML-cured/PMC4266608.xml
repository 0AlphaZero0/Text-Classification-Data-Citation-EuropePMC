Before treatment, significantly higher levels of CD109+ CECs and viable CD109+CECs were found in breast cancer patients and glioblastoma patients compared to healthy controls, and their number significantly decreased after treatment. Higher levels of endothelial specific transcripts expressed in developing endothelial cells CLEC14a, TMEM204, ARHGEF15, GPR116, were observed in sorted CD109+CECs when compared to sorted CD146+CECs, suggesting that these genes can play an important role not only during embryogenesis but also in adult angiogenesis. Interestingly, mRNA levels of TEM8 (identified as Antrax Toxin Receptor1, Antrax1) were expressed in CD109+CECs+ but not in CD146+CECs. </p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="25835" pm="."><plain>Conclusion <p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="25836" pm="."><plain>Taken together our results suggest that CD109 represent a rare population of circulating tumor endothelial cells, that play a potentially useful prognostic role in patients with glioblastoma.

Higher levels of CLEC14a, TMEM204, ARHGEF15, Gpr116 expressed in developing endothelial cells [33], were present in CD109+CECs when compared to CD146+CECs, suggesting that these genes may play an important role not only in developing endothelial cells but also in adult angiogenesis. <p><text><SENT sid="26023" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that CD109+CECs and CD146+CECs are two different subpopulation of endothelial cells, being these two antigens not expressed on the same cells, while CD34 (a marker currently used to identify progenitor cells) was positive on 20% of CD109+CECs and on 30% of CD146+CECs. <p><text><SENT sid="26024" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the number, viability and kinetic of CD109+CECs and of CD146+ CECs and observed that both subpopulation of endothelial cells are enriched in the blood of glioblastoma and breast cancer patients, are more viable when compared to value observed in healthy subject, and their number decrease significantly after treatment. <p><text><SENT sid="26025" pm="."><plain>In our previous experience, we reported that in patients with breast cancer treated with metronomic chemotherapy, CD146+CEC levels after two months of treatment were associated with prolonged PFS [15]. </plain></SENT>
