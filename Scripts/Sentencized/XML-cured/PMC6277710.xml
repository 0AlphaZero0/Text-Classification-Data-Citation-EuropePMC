</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86424" pm="."><plain>One of the major causes of liver-related mortality and morbidity is Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86425" pm="."><plain>It is also one of the reasons behinds of chronic liver disease and related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86426" pm="."><plain>Overall, 350,000 global deaths in a year have occurred because of HCV-related complications (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86427" pm="."><plain>HCV considered as an important disease in both developed and developing countries (4, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86428" pm="."><plain>There are 160 million patients with HCV infection in the worldwide (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86429" pm="."><plain>Transmission of this blood-borne pathogen will occur due to the exposure to the contaminated body fluids and blood (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86430" pm="."><plain>Despite our knowledge about hepatitis C virology and pathogenesis has been grown rapidly, there is little information about the current and future burden of this infection throughout the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86431" pm="."><plain>It may potentially need considerable health care services and impose very high costs for health systems in the United States, Europe, and others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86432" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is essential to have the information about hepatitis burden in order to the development of national and international health policies for prevention of complications and control of disease and injury (9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86433" pm="."><plain>Several methods have been proposed to quantify population-level burden of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86434" pm="."><plain>The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is one way to measure population health which is being increasingly used in comparing and analyzing the burden due to diseases (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86435" pm="."><plain>It is a concept similar to healthy year includes weights for time spent in less-than-perfect health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86436" pm="."><plain>DALYs are formed from two components: years of life lost (LLY) because of premature death and years lived with disability (YLD) consist of nonfatal injuries and disease (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86437" pm="."><plain>To measure the economic burden of hepatitis, a considerable number of studies have been published in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86438" pm="."><plain>The global epidemiology and burden of hepatitis C were measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86439" pm="."><plain>The total burden related to HCV may be as high as 4.2 million DALYs (8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86440" pm="."><plain>The average diagnosis and treatment costs of hepatitis C were studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86441" pm="."><plain>One course of treatment and six months after that with standard protocol plus Ribavirin and Peg-interferon plus Ribavirin have costs of exceeds 3,850 and 16,494 purchasing power parity dollars (PPP$) respectively (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86442" pm="."><plain>Hepatitis C is a very important and expensive disease for health care system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86443" pm="."><plain>HCV patients need expensive drug treatments and require high health care services (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86444" pm="."><plain>A modeling approach was used to quantify the current HCV-infected population, future disease progression and associated costs in Egypt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86445" pm="."><plain>With newer therapies, strategies to reduce disease burden are feasible and cost-effective (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86446" pm="."><plain>In one study, future morbidity, mortality, and costs resulting from HCV have been estimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86447" pm="."><plain>Number of deaths for chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma were estimated 165900 and 27200 deaths during year 2010 until year 2019 respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86448" pm="."><plain>Indirect medical costs for HCV services were calculated $10.7 billion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86449" pm="."><plain>From 2010 until 2019, HCV cause the loss of 1.83 million years of life in people younger than 65 with cost of $21.3 and $54.2 billion, respectively (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86450" pm="."><plain>In another study, cost-effectiveness of generic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C treatment was evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86451" pm="."><plain>By use of DAAs, the life expectancy increased by 8.02 years and the lifetime healthcare costs by $1,309 per-person treated in comparison of no treatment (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86452" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, the disability-adjusted life year’s estimation has not been done on HCV infection in Iran. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86456" pm="."><plain>To do this study, 200 patients with HCV infection, who referred to hospitals in three cities of Tehran, Karaj and Tabriz, Iran during year 2015, were randomly selected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86457" pm="."><plain>Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86458" pm="."><plain>The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86459" pm="."><plain>Public library system and questionnaire were used for data collections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86460" pm="."><plain>Questionnaire which contains information about demographic and patient’s history, quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment was prepared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86461" pm="."><plain>Content validity of the questionnaire was examined with reference to the gastroenterologists’ and pharmacoeconomists’ comments and opinions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86462" pm="."><plain>They were asked to evaluate relevance, completeness, scoring and clarity of each question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86463" pm="."><plain>The Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient for each question was determined to test the reliability of the questionnaire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86464" pm="."><plain>Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient more than 0.75 was approved level to each question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86465" pm="."><plain>Correlation of each question with other questions was higher than medium level and there was no negative correlation (an inverse relationship) between questions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86466" pm="."><plain>After questionnaire preparation, a review of the literature was undertaken to recognize the latest treatments available for patients with HCV, in Iran. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86467" pm="."><plain>In order to calculate total economic burden of hepatitis C, the algebraic sum of direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs was obtained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86468" pm="."><plain>Costs of DALYs and costs of economic welfare index were also calculated as intangible costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86469" pm="."><plain>These items were collected as following: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86470" pm="."><plain>For direct medical and non-medical costs and indirect costs’ calculations, diagnostic and laboratory tests, physician visits and drug treatments were considered as direct medical costs and transportation, meals and telephone conversation were considered as direct non-medical costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86471" pm="."><plain>Common therapeutic protocol in HCV infection including direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) was used (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86472" pm="."><plain>We also calculated accommodation costs as direct non-medical costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86473" pm="."><plain>As most of patients were in their own cities and did not need accommodation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86474" pm="."><plain>Therefore we eliminated accommodation costs from total non-medical direct costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86475" pm="."><plain>Days of absence from work (patient or his/her caregiver) were calculated as indirect costs by use of Laspeyres index. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86476" pm="."><plain>The unit costs of these items (diagnostic and laboratory tests and physician visits) were calculated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://irmna.com/">http://irmna.com/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86477" pm="."><plain>The prices of medication were retrieved from drug list of Food and Drug Organization of Iran (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov.ir/en/">http://www.fda.gov.ir/en/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86478" pm="."><plain>To estimate the total burden of hepatitis, we also calculated DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) using Murray methodology (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86479" pm="."><plain>The years of life lost (YLL) because of premature mortality and the years lived with disability (YLD) are the two components of DALYs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86480" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy was considered 74 and 77 year for men and women respectively based on life expectancy in Iran. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86481" pm="."><plain>Incidence, duration, and disability weight are the information specifically required for calculating YLD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86482" pm="."><plain>For estimation of parts of economic burden based on calculated DALYs, we multiplied DALYs by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86483" pm="."><plain>15572.83 PPP$. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86484" pm="."><plain>PPP$ was used for the purpose of international comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86485" pm="."><plain>We also added economic welfare index for calculating the total economic burden of hepatitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86486" pm="."><plain>Welfare index was calculated by social welfare cardinal function as below: W=1n∑i=1nYi=Y¯ </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86487" pm="."><plain>Where W is social welfare, Yi is the income of individual and n is number of individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86488" pm="."><plain>Finally, total economic burden of hepatitis C was obtained by the algebraic sum of direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86764" pm="."><plain>It also imposes a high socioeconomic burden on patients and the society (1, 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86765" pm="."><plain>Therefore, calculation of total costs of HCV is useful for healthcare systems to make a suitable health policy in the country. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86766" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to obtain total burden of HCV in Iran. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86767" pm="."><plain>Total direct medical and non-medical costs of HCV infection were estimated 24197.6 PPP$ annually per patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86768" pm="."><plain>Regarding the HCV patients population in Iran in 2015 (19), total direct costs for all HCV population in Iran have obtained 7,259,280,000 PPP$ annually from which the drug treatment costs had the largest share of it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86769" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to the previous studies regarding high costs of drug treatments in HCV patients (20, 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86770" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of HCV infection in Iran is low, total direct costs of HCV population are dramatic which means that it has a high priority for our healthcare systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86771" pm="."><plain>Some portions of direct medical costs of HCV will be decreased due to insurance coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86772" pm="."><plain>According to the insurance coverage percentages, different behavior of the insurance organizations in Iran, share of paid by patients and portion of services covered by insurance, we estimate that up to 40% of direct medical costs will be paid by insurance and the remaining will be deducted from the household consumption expenditure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86773" pm="."><plain>Therefore, about 4,393,356,000 PPP$ will be imposed on HCV patients population in Iran. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86774" pm="."><plain>As the total health costs in Iran in 2015 was 90,799,249,123 PPP$ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.worldbank.org/">https://data.worldbank.org/</ext-link>), total direct costs of HCV population was equal to 4.8% of it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86775" pm="."><plain>Since the household consumption expenditure per capita in 2015 was about 9962 PPP$ based on our results, total direct costs of HCV for each patient are more than the household consumption expenditure per capita. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86776" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for the HCV patient, household’s income is not enough to cover the costs of it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86777" pm="."><plain>Another point is about indirect costs of HCV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86778" pm="."><plain>It will impose 613,560,000 PPP$ on community and health care systems which is due to loss of productivity and can damage the economics of the society. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86779" pm="."><plain>Most of direct costs of HCV were spent on drug treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86780" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is a reasonable policy of our healthcare systems to increase insurance coverage of HCV drugs in order to decrease costs imposed on HCV patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86781" pm="."><plain>One of the main measure indexes of disease frequency is incidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86782" pm="."><plain>As it is just based on patient’s number and basic population data, for comparing between different areas or different times, it must be standardized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86783" pm="."><plain>Since DALYs consider both survival time and life quality, it is more inclusive than incidence (22). </plain></SENT>
