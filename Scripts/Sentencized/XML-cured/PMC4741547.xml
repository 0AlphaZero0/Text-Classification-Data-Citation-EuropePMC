</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36310" pm="."><plain>Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among adult Americans, with an estimated 136,800 new cases and 50,300 deaths in 2014 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36311" pm="."><plain>If detected early, patients with localized, resectable disease have a favorable prognosis with a 91% 5-year overall survival rate, yet survival rates decline significantly with disease progression [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36312" pm="."><plain>Patients with metastatic disease to distant organs at the time of presentation have an expected 5-year overall survival rate of only 12% and a median survival time of 29 months [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36313" pm="."><plain>Despite improved understanding of the molecular events leading to colon cancer, there is a continued need for prognostic markers that can predict disease progression, metastasis, or recurrence in patients with the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36314" pm="."><plain>For example, patients with stage II colon cancer, in which overall survival is already ∼80% with surgery alone, the benefit of adjuvant therapy does not improve survival by more than 5%, thus underscoring the need for better prognostic markers to determine low from high risk stage II patients [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36315" pm="."><plain>Additionally, elucidation of genes necessary for the metastatic process can lead to new avenues for targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36316" pm="."><plain>Genes induced in colon cancer provide novel candidate biomarkers of tumor phenotype and aggressiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36317" pm="."><plain>CEMIP, originally called KIAA1199/CCSP1, is one such gene that is highly upregulated in colon cancer [5-8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36318" pm="."><plain>The role of CEMIP in colon cancer progression and mediating oncogenic growth is unclear, with studies implicating CEMIP as a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [5, 7, 9], and as a promoter of glycogen breakdown and cellular survival [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36319" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study by Yoshida et al. demonstrated that CEMIP can bind to the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), and is essential for the degradation of HA by human fibroblast cells [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36320" pm="."><plain>HA is a large, linear molecule (&gt;1000 kDa) made up of repeating disaccharide units and is abundantly expressed in most tissues, including the colon [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36321" pm="."><plain>Degradation of HA to low molecular weight fragments can stimulate angiogenesis, promote cell migration, and play an important role in cancer progression and inflammation [13-16], thus suggesting a possible functional role for the upregulation of CEMIP in the progression of colon cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36322" pm="."><plain>In this study, we comprehensively characterize CEMIP expression in colon cancer and investigate its role in colon cancer progression and as an indicator of poor clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36323" pm="."><plain>We identify CEMIP as a secreted protein that is induced as early as the colon adenoma stage, whose overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome in colon cancer patients, and has a potential role in promoting tumor metastasis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36434" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have comprehensively characterized CEMIP expression in colon cancer and have provided the novel findings that CEMIP overexpression is associated with poor patient prognosis and is necessary for tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36435" pm="."><plain>We originally identified KIAA1199 as a novel transcript highly induced in colon cancer and deposited the full-length transcript and 5′ UTR variants as GenBank accession numbers AY581148, AY585237, and AY581149, under the name Colon Cancer Secreted Protein 1 (CCSP1) before the gene name was officially changed to CEMIP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36436" pm="."><plain>We found that CEMIP is markedly upregulated in colon cancer both at the mRNA and protein level, with induction occurring as early as the colon adenoma stage, and encodes a secreted protein (U.S. patent #7,118,912) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36437" pm="."><plain>Similar to ours and others [5-7] findings in colon cancer, a search of the Oncomine [30] database identifies microarray studies demonstrating upregulation of CEMIP in several other epithelial cancers, including breast [31], gastric [32], and pancreatic cancer [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36438" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that induction of CEMIP expression in neoplasia may be a general feature of many solid tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36439" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence of amplification of CEMIP or for rearrangement of the gene promoter as possible explanations for CEMIP overexpression in colon cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36440" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CEMIP was not found to be a target for amplification in the TCGA dataset [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36441" pm="."><plain>Findings by Sabates-Bellver et al., suggests that CEMIP overexpression in colon tumors may be due to activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, consequent to mutations in either APC or beta-catenin [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36442" pm="."><plain>This observation is consistent with our findings that induction of CEMIP is common in colon cancers and occurs as early as the colon adenoma stage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36443" pm="."><plain>Important to this study is our finding that elevated CEMIP expression in human colon tumors is associated with markedly reduced survival in stage III colon cancer cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36444" pm="."><plain>Individuals whose stage III colon cancer tumors express CEMIP below the median lived an average &gt; 8.6 years longer than stage III colon cancer cases whose tumor CEMIP levels were above the median, a dramatic difference in patient survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36445" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox regression analysis including age at diagnosis, gender, and race demonstrated that CEMIP expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36446" pm="."><plain>Elevated tumor CEMIP expression showed an even more statistically significant association with reduced survival in an expanded set of individuals having either stage II or stage III colon cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36447" pm="."><plain>Our finding of high tumor CEMIP expression associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer is supported by findings of a 50% decrease in 5-year survival of gastric cancer patients whose tumors expressed high versus low CEMIP [35] as well as a survey of breast cancer DNA microarray datasets finding reduced survival in patients with tumors expressing high versus low CEMIP [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36448" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the association of CEMIP expression with poor prognosis in colon cancer was found in a different context by Birkenkamp-Demtroder et al. based on immunohistochemical studies in which a slightly better prognosis was reported for subgroup of stage II patients with strong nuclear, yet weak cytoplasmic, staining for CEMIP compared to cases with strong cytoplasmic, or nuclear and cytoplasmic staining [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36449" pm="."><plain>Our findings of a marked difference in survival between individuals whose colon tumors have high versus low CEMIP in our patient cohort will clearly merit testing in follow-up studies of larger cohorts of stage III and of stage II plus III colon cancer cases, as well as in cohorts of sufficient size to detect possible effects of CEMIP expression on outcome of stage II only colon cancer cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36450" pm="."><plain>Our finding that knocking out CEMIP markedly attenuates xenograft growth provides the first in vivo data demonstrating a critical role for CEMIP expression in colon cancer tumor growth, thus suggesting that CEMIP directly contributes to tumor phenotype and may itself be a therapeutic target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36451" pm="."><plain>In testing for CEMIP somatic mutations, we identified only one mutation among 13 colon cancer cell lines, a homozygous Gly1173Asp alteration present in a single sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36452" pm="."><plain>Likewise, TCGA data finds CEMIP mutated in only 8 of 212 cases, with none of the mutations predicted to have a significant deleterious impact on function [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36453" pm="."><plain>Thus, the contribution of CEMIP to tumor phenotype appears to generally be mediated by the native protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36454" pm="."><plain>Facilitation of tumor growth by CEMIP overexpression may be due, in part, by protecting cells from apoptosis; as deletion of CEMIP resulted in increased cleaved caspase-3 staining in CEMIP knockout DLD-1 xenografts with significantly attenuated growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36455" pm="."><plain>Our findings are supported by studies in other cancers demonstrating CEMIP can protect cervical [37], gastric [10], and breast [38] cancer cells from apoptosis, though the exact molecular mechanism of CEMIP's anti-apoptotic effect has yet to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36456" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our demonstration that CEMIP knockout results in markedly increased intratumoral levels of HA suggests an important role for CEMIP overexpression in the degradation of HA in the extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36457" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the biochemical studies of Yoshida et al. demonstrating CEMIP as a hyaladherin involved in HA depolymerization [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36458" pm="."><plain>High molecular weight HA plays an important role in a variety of functions involved in maintaining tissue integrity and homeostasis while low molecular weight fragments from the degradation of HA are potent promoters of a variety of functions important to tumor progression, and have been detected in a variety of cancer types [13-16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36459" pm="."><plain>Of note, in vitro studies have demonstrated that addition of HA tetrasaccharides to cultured cell lines can induce heat shock proteins and suppress apoptosis [39], potentially linking CEMIP's anti-apoptotic activity with its role in HA depolymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36460" pm="."><plain>Our finding of an inverse association between CEMIP levels and HA deposition suggests a model in which CEMIP overexpression contributes to colon cancer phenotype both by removing a HA physical barrier as well as by increasing production of tumor promoting low molecular weight HA fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36461" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it suggests that CEMIP overexpression may be a novel target for therapy as studies in which tumor HA turnover is disrupted demonstrate tumor growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo [13, 40] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36462" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings that CEMIP is not only a prognostic marker of outcome in colon cancer, but also directly contributes to maintenance of tumor phenotype, should spur further investigations to determine the potential of CEMIP as a therapeutic target, and to elucidate its biological function in HA metabolism when overexpressed in human cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36463" pm="."><plain>Future studies are currently planned to elucidate the mechanism of CEMIP expression on protection from apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36464" pm="."><plain>Finally, the finding that CEMIP is a secreted protein whose expression is dramatically upregulated in colon adenomas and early colon cancers nominates this protein as a highly interesting candidate serological marker of early human colon neoplasia, for which future studies will certainly be warranted. </plain></SENT>
