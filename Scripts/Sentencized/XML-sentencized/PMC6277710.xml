<SENT sid="86426" pm="."><plain>Overall, 350,000 global deaths in a year have occurred because of HCV-related complications (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86430" pm="."><plain>Despite our knowledge about hepatitis C virology and pathogenesis has been grown rapidly, there is little information about the current and future burden of this infection throughout the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86431" pm="."><plain>It may potentially need considerable health care services and impose very high costs for health systems in the United States, Europe, and others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86432" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is essential to have the information about hepatitis burden in order to the development of national and international health policies for prevention of complications and control of disease and injury (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86433" pm="."><plain>Several methods have been proposed to quantify population-level burden of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86434" pm="."><plain>The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is one way to measure population health which is being increasingly used in comparing and analyzing the burden due to diseases (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86478" pm="."><plain>To estimate the total burden of hepatitis, we also calculated DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) using Murray methodology (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86479" pm="."><plain>The years of life lost (YLL) because of premature mortality and the years lived with disability (YLD) are the two components of DALYs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86766" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to obtain total burden of HCV in Iran. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86767" pm="."><plain>Total direct medical and non-medical costs of HCV infection were estimated 24197.6 PPP$ annually per patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86768" pm="."><plain>Regarding the HCV patients population in Iran in 2015 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), total direct costs for all HCV population in Iran have obtained 7,259,280,000 PPP$ annually from which the drug treatment costs had the largest share of it. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86775" pm="."><plain>Since the household consumption expenditure per capita in 2015 was about 9962 PPP$ based on our results, total direct costs of HCV for each patient are more than the household consumption expenditure per capita. </plain></SENT>
