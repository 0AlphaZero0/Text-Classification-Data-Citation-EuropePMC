</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14945" pm="."><plain>This study compares the effect of extreme physical activities with an inactive life style on knees and the lower back at middle age using elite infantry soldier and Torah scholar cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14946" pm="."><plain>From an engineering stand point, this represents a test of very high versus very low sustained loading on these structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14947" pm="."><plain>The strength of the study is the uniform genetic backgrounds of the subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14948" pm="."><plain>The main study limitation is the relatively small number of subjects in each of the two study cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14949" pm="."><plain>Even with this limitation, statistically significant higher lumbar disk degeneration was found in the elite infantry cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14950" pm="."><plain>In spite of the extreme differences in the musculoskeletal loading between the cohorts, there was surprisingly little difference found by MRI criteria, in the amount of degenerative changes in both their knees and lumbar spines at middle age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14951" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that the knee may possibly be more resilient to sustained heavy loading than are lumbar disks. </plain></SENT>
