Carbetocin has a longer half-life when compared to oxytocin, resulting in a reduced use of additional uterotonics. Oxytocin is known to cause fewer cardiovascular side effects when administered as a short-infusion compared to as an intravenous bolus. Based on these findings, we aim at comparing carbetocin 100 mcg given as a slow intravenous bolus with carbetocin 100 mcg applied as a short-infusion in 100&#160;ml 0.9&#160;% sodium chloride in women undergoing a planned or unplanned caesarean delivery. We hypothesise uterine contraction not to be inferior to a bolus application (primary efficacy endpoint) and greater haemodynamic stability to be achieved after a short-infusion than after a bolus administration, as measured by heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (primary safety endpoint).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled, investigator-initiated, non-inferiority trial taking place at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.</p><p>Uterine tone is quantified by manual palpation by the obstetrician using a linear analogue scale from 0 to 100 at 2, 3, 5 and 10&#160;minutes after cord clamping. We will evaluate whether the lower limit of the confidence interval for the difference of the maximal uterine tone within the first 5&#160;minutes after cord clamping between both groups does not include the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of &#8722;10. Both haemodynamic secondary endpoints will be analysed using a linear regression model, adjusting for the baseline value and the dosage of vasoactive drug given between cord clamping and 1 minute thereafter, in order to investigate superiority of a short-infusion as compared to a bolus application.</p><p>We will follow the extension of CONSORT guidelines for reporting the results of non-inferiority trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Haemodynamic stability and adequate uterine tone are important outcomes in caesarean sections.

PPH is defined as a blood loss of at least 500&#160;ml after vaginal birth and at least 1000&#160;ml after CS and/or the need for blood transfusion within 24&#160;hours after delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and represents the most important cause of maternal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As PPH is more common after CS than after vaginal delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and as the rate of CS is rising, the incidence of PPH is expected to increase accordingly.</p><p>The two most commonly used uterotonic drugs after operative delivery are oxytocin and carbetocin, a synthetic oxytocin analogue. Carbetocin has some advantages over oxytocin due its four- to ten-times longer half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], allowing for a single injection. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis showed that carbetocin significantly reduces the use of additional uterotonics as compared to oxytocin, although the risk of severe PPH remains similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Carbetocin is associated with cardiovascular side effects including hypotension and a compensatory increase in heart rate similar to those of oxytocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to randomised trials with oxytocin, the extent of these cardiovascular side effects seems to be dependent on dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the rate of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The manufacturer of oxytocin requires the drug to be given as a short-infusion to maintain cardiovascular stability. In contrast, the manufacturer of carbetocin recommends a bolus injection of carbetocin. Whether carbetocin administration as short-infusion offers the optimal balance between contractile benefit to minimise maternal haemorrhage and reduce cardiovascular side effects is unclear.</p><p>In this randomised controlled trial, we aim to investigate whether carbetocin 100 mcg applied as a short-infusion in 100&#160;ml 0.9&#160;% sodium chloride as compared to a bolus injection minimises the cardiovascular side effects (first secondary safety endpoint) without compromising uterine tone (primary efficacy endpoint) in women undergoing a planned or unplanned caesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a prospective, single-centre, randomised, double-dummy, investigator-initiated, non-inferiority trial conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.

The non-inferiority margin has been defined to be &#8722;10 on the LAS by the four most senior obstetricians at our institution.

Continuous variables will be described by using the mean (SD) or median (interquartile range) as appropriate, categorical variables by using count (percentage).</p><p>In order to answer the primary research question, a CI of the mean difference in LAS score of the maximal uterine tone within the first 5&#160;minutes after cord clamping will be calculated. If the lower limit of this CI does not include the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of &#8722;10, an inferiority of a short-infusion of more than 10 points on the LAS as compared to a bolus application is unlikely. In order to improve efficiency, an additional model will be built adjusting for the most relevant confounders, such as experience of the obstetrician, parity or number of previous CS, number of risk factors for PPH (multiple pregnancy, abnormal placentation, history of PPH or uterine atony), duration of surgery, and duration of antenatal oxytocin infusion. In order to compare the change of the uterine tone over time between both study groups, a generalised estimation equation (GEE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] will be built using an exchangeable correlation matrix (with an interaction term between treatment group and time). Moreover, the uterine tone over time will be displayed graphically.</p><p>The haemodynamic secondary outcomes (lowest mean arterial blood pressure and highest heart rate within the first 5&#160;minutes after the administration of the study drug) will be analysed using a linear regression model adjusting for the corresponding baseline value and the amount of vasoactive drug administered during this period. In a further analysis, the course over time of mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be modelled using a GEE model with an exchangeable correlation matrix, using a knot at the average time of the lowest mean arterial pressure adjusted for the dosage of vasopressors administered, in order to compare the trend over time in both groups. Moreover, the change over time in blood pressure and heart rate will be displayed graphically. The incidence of any clinically relevant ST segment changes in both groups will be compared using a chi-squared or a Fisher&#8217;s exact test as appropriate. Further secondary endpoints will only be analysed descriptively. The comparison of the calculated blood loss will be adjusted in a linear regression model for whether or not the mother is breastfeeding.</p><p>All analyses and graphs will be performed using Intercooled Stata Version 13.1 for Mac (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Based on the findings of reduction in cardiovascular side-effects with a short-infusion as compared to a bolus injection found for oxytocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], our study hypothesis is that a slower administration rate of carbetocin (using a short-infusion) minimises cardiovascular side effects without compromising uterine tone. In the following, we discuss considerations regarding trial design and chosen endpoints.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Choice of non-inferiority design</title><p>The aim of this trial is to reach greater haemodynamic stability using the slower administration method (primary safety endpoint) while ensuring non-inferiority with regard to the uterine tone (primary efficacy endpoint) and ultimately the risk of elevated blood loss. Since superiority in haemodynamic endpoints can be achieved with fewer patients, we decided to choose as our primary endpoint non-inferiority in uterine tone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Choice of primary endpoint</title><p>We consider the choice of the appropriate measurement of our primary endpoint as a main challenge in this trial. The choice of our primary outcome is based on a randomised controlled trial performed by Butwick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] who also used a LAS ranging from 0 to 10 to assess uterine tone in a similar setting. We expanded the scale from 0 to 100 to avoid the fact that some outcome assessors used decimal places (e.g. 7.5) while others did not. Moreover, manual palpation of the uterus represents the standard method to assess uterine tone in daily clinical practice. To reduce bias, especially when using a subjective primary outcome measurement, we have established and will maintain blinding by using a double-dummy technique for study drug administration in patients and all care providers until the statistical analysis has been performed. We have chosen to abstain from a binary assessment of the uterine tone as it would be too parallel to our secondary outcome variable &#8216;any additional uterotonics &#8211; yes/no&#8217;. The objective efficacy outcome of interest would have been intraoperative blood loss. Blood loss during PPH is often estimated visually, but visual assessment has been shown to be imprecise, usually underestimating blood loss particularly concerning larger volumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We have, therefore, decided to choose the uterine tone as our primary outcome variable. We consider blood loss as a secondary endpoint, calculated by taking into account the pre- and postoperative haematocrit and the estimated blood volume of the parturient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Haemodynamic measurement method</title><p>We chose haemodynamic stability, defined as lowest mean arterial pressure and highest heart rate within the first 5&#160;minutes after the administration of the carbetocin. After evaluating the options for continuous invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurements, we have decided to measure blood pressure non-invasively using a cuff on the upper arm. We have considered the accuracy and the precision of the continuous non-invasive methods insufficient to justify their use in the context of this trial. Although the risk for complications of an intra-arterial catheter is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the potentially severe side effects do not justify invasive blood pressure monitoring.</p><p>This sample size allows showing a superiority of the short-infusion over the bolus administration in mean arterial blood pressure by at least 5&#160;mmHg with 80&#160;% power and a type-1 error of 5&#160;% assuming a SD of 10. Thus, even a clinically irrelevant difference in efficacy could be found with our data. However, we need to acknowledge that we are not able to show a minor difference in the incidence of serious drops in blood pressure with our sample size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Choice of study population</title><p>This trial will include patients undergoing a planned and an unplanned CS. Patients undergoing a unplanned CS often have already received oxytocin to induce or enhance labour, thus, showing a different response to the intraoperative dosage of carbetocin. Therefore, we are using a stratified randomisation for planned and unplanned CS. Excluding these patients would limit the generalisability of our study results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Poor recruitment is the most frequently reported cause for discontinuation of a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, due to good interdisciplinary cooperation, adequate personal and financial resources and a high acceptance for clinical research, we are able to exceed the target recruitment rate (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additionally, an amendment was handed in shortly after the beginning of the recruitment to incorporate patients with a breech position fetus. Within the same amendment, we have also translated the study information and the consent into English to be able to address more patients.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Target and actual recruitment rate to achieve the given sample size within the planned recruitment period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1285_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Implications for future clinical practice</title><p>Haemodynamic stability and adequate uterine contractility are important outcomes in CS. The results of this trial may be used to optimise these factors and thereby increase safety in parturients due to reduced cardiovascular side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently enrolling patients. Upon submission of this manuscript, 60&#160;% of the patients have been enrolled.
