Biochemical and genetic studies showed that DNA ends can also be joined via microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ), especially when proteins responsible for NHEJ, such as Ku, are reduced or absent. While it has been known that Ku-dependent NHEJ requires DNA ligase IV, it is unclear which DNA ligase(s) is required for Ku-independent MHEJ. In this study, we used a cell-free assay to determine the roles of DNA ligases I, III and IV in MHEJ and NHEJ. We found that siRNA mediated down-regulation of DNA ligase I or ligase III in human HTD114 cells led to impaired end joining that was mediated by 2-, 3- or 10-bp microhomology. In addition, nuclear extract from human fibroblasts harboring a mutation in DNA ligase I displayed reduced MHEJ activity. Furthermore, treatment of HTD114 nuclear extracts with an antibody against DNA ligase I or III also significantly reduced MHEJ. These data indicate that DNA ligases I and III are required in MHEJ. DNA ligase IV, on the contrary, is not required in MHEJ but facilitates Ku-dependent NHEJ. Therefore, MHEJ and NHEJ require different DNA ligases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most serious form of DNA damage and a single unrepaired DSB can lead to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In mammalian cells, there are at least two enzymatically distinct pathways for the repair of DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). HR uses a homologous template (most frequently the sister chromatid) to carry out DSB repair, whereas NHEJ joins two ends without the requirement for extensive homology. Proteins known to be involved in NHEJ include DNA-PK<sub>CS</sub> (the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase), Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, XRCC4 (X-ray Cross Complementing factor 4), and DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, DNA ends can also be joined via microhomologous sequences flanking the break point, especially when proteins responsible for NHEJ, such as Ku, are absent or limiting in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">4&#8211;13</xref>). Microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ) is always accompanied by a deletion that spans one of the two homologous sequences and the intervening sequence, if any, and thus is a mutagenic repair pathway. Indeed, microhomologies were observed at deletion break points in the <italic>HPRT</italic> gene in primary human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and in the <italic>Aprt</italic> gene in hamster cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Furthermore, translocations mediated by MHEJ were frequently detected in pre-B cell lymphomas in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the factors involved in MHEJ, but it can be assumed that the MHEJ pathway may consist of a series of steps, culminating in the sealing of DNA nicks by the action of a DNA ligase. DNA ligases catalyze the joining of nicked DNA in DNA replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Eukaryotic cells encode three well-characterized ATP-dependent DNA ligases, DNA ligases I, III and IV, each specializing in distinct pathways of DNA repair and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Although these DNA ligases vary in sequence and size, sequence and structural analyses have shown that they contain a common catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). While the central core of the enzyme carries out the catalytic function of sealing nicked DNA, other domains may determine the specificity of the various ligases in different DNA metabolic reactions, e.g. by targeting ligases to different parts of the nucleus or by mediating interactions with different proteins. DNA ligase I is involved in at least two distinct processes within the nucleus: the joining of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication, and the ligation of a newly synthesized patch during base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). DNA ligase I is recruited to sites of DNA replication by its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It has been shown that the loss of its PCNA binding activity severely compromised the ability of DNA ligase I to join Okazaki fragments, and to participate in long-patch BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Two isoforms of DNA ligase III resulting from alternately spliced mRNA variants have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Ligase III&#945; is ubiquitously distributed, whereas ligase III&#946; has been detected only in testes, where it is believed to play a role in recombination during meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). DNA ligase III&#945; interacts with XRCC1 (X-ray Cross Complementing factor 1) via its carboxy-terminal BRCT (BRCA C-terminal) domains and functions in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). DNA ligase IV is distinct from other DNA ligases in that it possesses two tandem C-terminal BRCT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This protein forms a complex with XRCC4, which appears to stabilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and stimulate the overall activity of ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This complex further interacts with DNA-PK<sub>CS</sub> and the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer to function in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Though many studies have revealed the role of DNA ligases in DNA repair pathways, such as NHEJ and BER, a systematic study of these ligases in the MHEJ pathway has been lacking. We recently developed a cell-free assay, with which factors modulating two end-joining pathways, i.e. Ku-dependent NHEJ and MHEJ, can be evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We previously showed that Ku and histone H1 facilitate error-free NHEJ and inhibit MHEJ, and that FEN-1 is involved in MHEJ. In the present study, we have determined the roles of DNA ligases I, III and IV in these end-joining pathways. We found that while DNA ligase IV is required to join DNA ends in the Ku-dependent NHEJ pathway, DNA ligase I and ligase III are required in MHEJ.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>Human cell line HTD114 was grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Briefly, linearized DNA substrates were incubated with nuclear protein extract at 14&#176;C for 2 h. DNA products were deproteinized, purified and separated by electrophoresis through 0.6% agarose gels. The intensity of DNA bands was quantified by using Kodak Gel Logic 100 Imaging System and Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software. The overall end-joining efficiency was calculated as the percentage of end-joined product (dimer and multimers) as a fraction of total DNA in the reaction (monomer, dimer and multimers).

Nuclear extract was then incubated with 380 ng linear DNA at 14&#176;C for 1 h, and DNA end-joined products were analyzed with agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of MHEJ</title><p>The MHEJ activity of individual protein extract was determined by two steps. First, a quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to measure the total amount of &#8216;head to tail&#8217; end-joined products, including MHEJ products. Second, the fraction of end-joined products mediated by microhomology was determined by PCR amplification of the junction of rejoined ends, followed by XcmI digestion for DNA substrates with 10-bp repeats or by DNA sequencing for substrates with 2- and 3-bp repeats. The MHEJ activity of individual nuclear extracts was calculated by multiplying the values obtained in these two steps.</p><sec><title>Step one</title><p>The primers utilized in the quantitative real-time PCR were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). One pair of primers amplifies a DNA fragment containing the rejoined ends. The sequences of the primers for amplifying the 10-bp-mediated products are: forward, 5&#8242;-GCC AGT GCC AAG CTA CCA TC -3&#8242;, and reverse, 5&#8242;-TGG AAT TGT GAG CGG ATA ACA AT-3&#8242;. The sequences of the primers for amplifying the 2- or 3-bp-mediated end-joined products are: forward, 5&#8242;-GTT GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GTG-3&#8242;, and reverse, 5&#8242;-CAG CTA TGA CAT GAT TAC GAA TTC G-3&#8242;. As an internal loading control, a pair of primers were used to amplify a DNA fragment that is about 70 bp away from the junction of rejoined ends. All DNA in the end-joining reaction, including monomers and multimers, can be amplified by this pair of primers, forward, ATT CAG GCT GCG CAA CTG TT-3&#8242;, and reverse, 5&#8242;-CCC AAC TTA ATC GCC TTG CA-3&#8242;. An aliquot of the end-joined product was amplified for 40 cycles on a GeneAmp 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Syber Green dye was used for signal detection. All analyses were carried out in triplicate, and nontemplate controls and dissociation curves were used to ensure specific template amplification.

If joining of the DNA ends is mediated by the 10-bp microhomology, resulting in an XcmI site (CCAN<sub>9</sub>TGG) at the junction, digestion of PCR products (&#8764;600 bp) with XcmI would give rise to a 400- and 200-bp fragment. Restriction fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel. The intensity of the undigested and XcmI-digested fragments was quantified using Kodak Gel Logic 100 Imaging System and Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software. The relative contribution of the 10-bp microhomology-mediated end-joining of the DNA substrate was calculated as the percentage of the XcmI-digested fragments of total PCR products (sum of the undigested and XcmI-digested fragments).</p><p>The relative contribution of MHEJ using the 2- or 3-bp microhomology was determined by sequencing the junction of rejoined ends.

Preincubation of 1.6 &#956;g nuclear protein extract prepared from HTD114 cells with 1 &#956;g monoclonal antibody raised against ligase I before initiating the end-joining assay reduced the overall end-joining efficiency by 7-fold, 1% versus 7% in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), and the MHEJ activity by about 5-fold, as compared to the control, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E).

This notion is supported by findings showing that mammalian cell lines deficient in either DNA ligase I, III or IV exhibit different phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We showed here that human DNA ligases I and III contribute to microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ). The supporting evidence includes: first, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of DNA ligase I or III in human HTD114 cells leads to impaired joining of DNA ends mediated by a 10-, 2- or 3-bp microhomology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>); second, GM16096, a cell line derived from a patient with immunodeficiency, increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and delayed development due to loss of DNA ligase I function, showed decreased level of MHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>); third, treatment of HTD114 nuclear extracts with antiserum against DNA ligase I or III significantly reduced MHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We have also shown that human DNA ligase IV is not required in MHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6 F7 F8">Figures 6&#8211;8</xref>). In addition, reduction of ligase IV significantly decreased Ku-dependent NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that human DNA ligases I, III and IV each play a different role in MHEJ and Ku-dependent NHEJ, the two end-joining pathways for DNA DSBs.</p><p>DNA ligase I functions in DNA replication to join Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA synthesis and in DNA BER to seal single-strand nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Our data indicate that DNA ligase I is also involved in end joining of DNA DSBs, especially in MHEJ. Although ligase I interacts with several different proteins in DNA replication and BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), it remains unclear whether or not it acts alone in MHEJ. It has been shown that the amino terminus of the DNA ligase I protein has a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding motif that is required for the loading of the DNA ligase I protein to replication foci within the nuclei of S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Moreover, the PCNA-binding motif is required for the efficient joining of Okazaki fragments and completion of long patch BER in cell extract assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that in addition to DNA ligase I, PCNA interacts with DNA polymerases &#948; &#949; and &#946; replication factor C (RFC), and a DNA structure-specific endonuclease (FEN-1), and coordinates their activities by forming complexes that are involved in several DNA metabolic pathways, including the processing of Okazaki fragments, and the repair of DNA base damage and single-strand breaks (SSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#8211;34</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that PCNA coordinates the involvement of DNA ligase I and other factors, such as FEN-1, in MHEJ. Indeed, it has been reported that FEN-1 is required for the MHEJ pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It is possible that FEN-1 is responsible for the removal of single-stranded flaps formed from broken DNA ends during MHEJ, and then ligase I seals the remaining nick. All these processes are probably mediated by the protein&#8211;protein interaction of FEN-1 and ligase I with PCNA.</p><p>Besides its critical role in the repair of damaged bases and SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), evidence from several studies suggests that DNA ligase III is also involved in DSB repair through an alternative route of DSB repair that complement the DNA-PK/XRCC4/ligase IV-dependent NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#8211;37</xref>). In line with these findings, we have shown that DNA ligase III is required for MHEJ. While ligase III exists in a tight complex with XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) in BER to repair DNA base damage and DNA SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), it was also reported that the Ku-independent end-joining, which may be mediated by microhomology sequences, required the synapsis activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and the ligation activity of the XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), implying that ligase III may also work together with other factors in MHEJ. However, amongst DNA ligases, ligase III is unique in having a zinc-finger motif at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), enabling its recruitment to DNA strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Furthermore, Taylor <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) reported that the zinc-finger motif confers upon ligase III the ability to bind DNA duplexes and stimulates intermolecular end joining between DNA duplexes. Therefore, the possibility that ligase III functions alone in DNA end joining can not be excluded.</p><p>Like DNA ligase III that forms a complex with XRCC1, DNA ligase IV is tightly associated with XRCC4, upon which it depends for stability and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Strikingly, ligase IV&#8211;XRCC4 complex functions in coupling with Ku heterodimers and DNA PK<sub>CS</sub> in NHEJ, but not in other DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In line with this notion, we here demonstrated that DNA ligase IV facilitated Ku-dependent end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), but was not required for MHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Furthermore, when ligase IV was absent, the activity of MHEJ in the nuclear extract was increased, suggesting that DNA ligase IV may negatively regulate the MHEJ pathway. It is not clear how ligase IV inhibits MHEJ. One possibility is that the Ku-ligase IV&#8211;XRCC4-dependent NHEJ pathway, which is initiated by binding of Ku proteins to DNA ends, may compete with the MHEJ pathway for binding to and processing DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Once the DNA ends are ligated by DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex, Ku proteins presumably become dissociated from DNA, and bind to other DNA ends to start another round of NHEJ reaction. Lack of DNA ligase IV would lead to an incomplete NHEJ reaction in which Ku proteins cannot be released from DNA ends. Due to lack of competition caused by a shortage of recycled Ku proteins, DNA ends would have a greater chance to be exposed to nuclease attack and to be joined by the alternative MHEJ pathway. In addition, there is growing evidence showing that DNA ligase IV may coordinate DNA processing activities that are critical for both NHEJ and MHEJ. For instance, Ma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) showed that there are conserved physical and functional interactions between DNA polymerase (pol) X family members (pol &#956; and pol &#955;) and DNA ligase IV that coordinate gap-filling DNA synthesis and DNA ligation in NHEJ. Notably, in yeast, DNA ligase IV physically and functionally interacts with Rad27 (FEN-1 in mammalian cells) to process and join DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Therefore, while ligase IV, by interacting with other DNA processing proteins, may facilitate the Ku-dependent NHEJ pathway, it may inhibit MHEJ as a consequence of the competition for components common to both pathways.</p><p>Overall, our work showed that human DNA ligase I and ligase III, which are involved in long patch BER and short patch BER, respectively, to repair DNA base damage and SSBs, are also critical for the repair of DSBs by MHEJ. It should also be noted that the requirement of ligase I and III seems to vary depending on the length of microhomology sequences. While a reduction in ligase III affects MHEJ using both short and long microhomology, a reduction in ligase I had only slightly affected MHEJ using 2-bp repeats, though it greatly decreased the MHEJ using 10-bp repeats. Since the 2- and 3-bp substrates are much more likely to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, ligase III is probably the primary ligase contributing to MHEJ. This notion is in accordance with previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#8211;37</xref>). Furthermore, our observations also suggest that DNA ligase I and ligase III may function in MHEJ through two independent pathways. In keeping up with this notion, protein partners of DNA ligases I and III, which are required for their stability, DNA-binding recruitment and catalytic activity, have never been shown to overlap. Although little is known about whether or not other factors may be involved in MHEJ, further studies of factors involved in the repair of DNA base damage and SSBs by using our end-joining assay may shed more light on the mechanisms of DNA DSB repair.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (ES011633 and P30ES05022), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNG05GN24G), and New Jersey Stem Cell Research grants from New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology (06-2042-014-85 and 07-2042-014-90).
