The use of MRI in clinical practice has had a particularly notable impact on the investigation of patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). Prior to MRI, there was reliance on radiographs as the most important imaging tool for identifying patients with sacroiliitis. With MRI, inflammation in the axial skeleton can now be visualized even in the absence of radiographic damage (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) has established classification standards for patients with axial SpA, including patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The imaging arm of the ASAS criteria requires the presence of sacroiliitis on MRI or radiography in addition to 1 SpA feature for patients with chronic low back pain with the onset of back pain at age &#8804;45 years. Positive MRI findings for sacroiliitis characteristic of SpA were further defined by the ASAS/Outcome Measures in Rheumatology MRI working group as the presence of bone marrow edema highly suggestive of SpA, with &gt;1 bone marrow edema lesion on a single slice or 1 bone marrow edema lesion present on at least 2 consecutive slices (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The ASAS classification criteria for axial SpA were specifically developed to facilitate the conduct of clinical trials. Fulfillment of the imaging arm of the criteria takes into account the presence of MRI-documented inflammation only in the sacroiliac (SI) joints, but not in the spine (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In daily clinical practice, MRI findings can be useful in confirming a clinical diagnosis of nonradiographic axial SpA and detecting objective evidence of active inflammation in patients with an established diagnosis of nonradiographic axial SpA (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, a sensitivity of MRI of only 38% for biopsy-proven sacroiliitis was reported (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Inflammation of the axial skeleton in nonradiographic axial SpA may involve the SI joints and/or spine. In the ASAS criteria validation study, eligibility criteria did not include a specified disease activity level. Of the 130 patients diagnosed as having axial SpA who underwent MRI of the SI joints and spine, only 5.4% had active inflammation in the spine but not in the SI joints (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the present study of patients with nonradiographic axial SpA who had active disease, we evaluated the presence of spinal inflammation on MRI at baseline among these patients with and without sacroiliitis on MRI, and we compared the disease characteristics of these patient subgroups.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>ABILITY-1 (NCT00939003) is an ongoing phase III, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of adalimumab versus placebo in patients at least 18 years of age with nonradiographic axial SpA classified using the ASAS axial SpA criteria (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) who had an inadequate response to, intolerance to, or contraindication for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As part of the assessment for fulfillment of the ASAS criteria, investigators reported whether or not patients had MRI evidence of active inflammatory lesions of the SI joints on either a prior or current MRI scan with definite bone marrow edema/osteitis highly suggestive of sacroiliitis. Active nonradiographic axial SpA was defined as a total back pain score of &#8805;4 cm on a 0&#8211;10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) score of &#8805;4 cm on a 0&#8211;10-cm VAS. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) as defined by the modified New York criteria (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), past or present diagnosis of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, or prior exposure to biologic therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>MRI assessments</title><p>MRI of the SI joints and spine was performed at baseline. Images were scored, using the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) method for SI joints (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and the SPARCC 6&#8211;discovertebral unit (6-DVU) method for the spine (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), independently by 2 central readers who were blinded with regard to time point and treatment. Scoring of the spine MRI was completed by the readers before seeing and scoring the corresponding MRI scans of the SI joints from the same time point. The mean scores from the 2 readers were used.</p><p>Six consecutive coronal slices were selected as representing the synovial compartment of the SI joints. Each SI joint, left and right, was divided into quadrants for a total of 8 per coronal slice. Each quadrant was assessed and scored for the presence (scored 1) or absence (scored 0) of bone marrow edema. Each coronal slice per SI joint was also given an additional score of 1 for the presence of an &#8220;intense&#8221; signal and an additional score of 1 for a &#8220;deep&#8221; lesion, defined as a homogeneous, unequivocal increase in signal &gt;1 cm from the articular surface. The maximum possible score for all SI joints across 6 slices was 48 for the presence of bone marrow edema, 12 for intense edema, and 12 for deep edema, for a maximum possible total score of 72 (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>For the spine, the 6 most severely affected DVUs were selected by an independent reviewer who did not perform the scoring. Each DVU was divided into 4 quadrants, with each quadrant assessed for the presence (scored 1) or absence (scored 0) of bone marrow edema. Each quadrant was scored on 3 consecutive sagittal slices per DVU, yielding a maximum possible score of 12 per DVU for bone marrow edema. Each sagittal slice per DVU was given an additional score of 1 for the presence of an &#8220;intense&#8221; signal and an additional score of 1 for a &#8220;deep&#8221; lesion, defined as a homogeneous, unequivocal increase in STIR signal &gt;1 cm from the vertebral end plate. The maximum possible score for all 6 DVUs was 72 for the presence of bone marrow edema, 18 for intense edema, and 18 for deep edema, for a maximum possible total score of 108 (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Intra- and interreader reliability of baseline scores for MRI SPARCC scoring of both the SI joints and spine was assessed. Interreader correlations for the SI joints and spine were based on images from 177 and 176 patients, respectively. Intrareader correlations were based on a subset of 9 patients whose MRIs were reread by the same reader.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All patients were combined in these analyses, regardless of randomized treatment assignment. Analyses were performed only on baseline data obtained prior to randomization to study treatment. For the purpose of this analysis, positive evidence of inflammation on MRI was defined as an MRI SPARCC score of &#8805;2 for either the SI joints (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) or spine. Scoring of the baseline MR images was already completed when these cutoffs were determined. Descriptive statistics are presented for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the correlation of MRI SPARCC score with symptom duration and baseline disease activity measures. Analysis of variance was used to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for intra- and interreader reliability of MRI SPARCC scores. In addition, we evaluated agreement between readers' assessment of the spine or SI joint in terms of a SPARCC score of &lt;2 versus &#8805;2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Intra- and interreader reliability was strong for baseline SPARCC spine and SI joint MRI scores. The ICCs for intrareader reliability for SPARCC spine scores were 0.90 and 0.86 for readers 1 and 2, respectively. The ICCs for intrareader reliability for SPARCC SI joint scores were 0.70 and 0.92, respectively. The ICC for interreader reliability was 0.90 for SPARCC spine scores and 0.95 for SI joint scores. The 2 readers agreed on the assessment of the baseline MRI of the spine in terms of SPARCC score &lt;2 versus &#8805;2 for 84% of the cases, and the 2 readers agreed on SPARCC SI joint scores for 79% of the cases.</p><p>At baseline, 89 of the 185 study patients (48%) were reported by the investigator to have past or present MRI evidence of sacroiliitis as required by the ASAS axial SpA criteria.

We showed that among patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA as defined by BASDAI and total back pain scores, spinal inflammation on MRI may be observed in half of those without MRI evidence of SI joint inflammation. Sex differences were noted in MRI findings. More males were in the subgroup with MRI evidence of inflammation of both the spine and SI joints at study entry. An observation that has important clinical relevance is the finding that SPARCC spine MRI scores correlated with symptom duration. Only approximately one-third of patients in this study with bone marrow edema in the spine regardless of the presence or absence of sacroiliitis seen on MRI had symptom duration of &lt;5 years, but approximately two-thirds of patients had symptom duration of &#8805;5 years. Previous studies in patients with duration of axial SpA symptoms of &lt;5 years and MRI evidence of either SI joint or spine inflammation have shown lower percentages of patients with MRI evidence of spine inflammation than in our study (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although the patient populations in those studies were somewhat different from our patient population, the data suggest that MRI evidence of spine inflammation in the absence of MRI evidence of SI joint inflammation may not be a lesser concern in patients with shorter symptom duration.</p><p>The small but significant negative correlation noted between the SPARCC SI joint score and the BASDAI is most likely a chance finding; this is underscored by a lack of correlation of baseline SPARCC SI joint and spine scores with other baseline clinical disease activity measures in nonradiographic axial SpA. This is generally consistent with previous reports in patients with axial SpA (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the lack of correlation with CRP level is surprising (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and indicates that both CRP level and MRI findings should be considered in the evaluation for active disease in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA. The distribution of DVU involvement along the spine in our study population confirms previous findings that the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine are the areas most frequently affected by inflammation in axial SpA (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>This study has several limitations. The study population had longstanding nonradiographic axial SpA. The scope of the analyses did not include evaluation of correlation of MRI findings with treatment response or change in disease activity. We used a definition of positive MRI evidence of active inflammation in the spine&#8212;a SPARCC spine score of &#8805;2&#8212;that has not been previously validated. The analyses were focused on evaluating MRI evidence of active inflammation in the spine and SI joints in patients with established nonradiographic axial SpA that is clinically active. Therefore, the findings and conclusions do not necessarily address the approach to imaging used in clinical practice when making a diagnosis of axial SpA. Typically, the SI joints are imaged first in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient in whom axial SpA is suspected. An important question for clinicians is whether imaging of the spine should be performed if the SI joint scan does not reveal axial SpA but the disease is strongly suspected. This study was not designed to address that important question. There was also no group of patients without axial SpA who served as a control for this exercise.</p><p>In summary, spinal inflammation without evidence of SI joint inflammation on MRI was observed in patients with longstanding nonradiographic axial SpA. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA with shorter symptom duration and to investigate the optimal use of SI joint and spine MRI in clinical practice for monitoring disease activity and response to therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Kathleen V.
