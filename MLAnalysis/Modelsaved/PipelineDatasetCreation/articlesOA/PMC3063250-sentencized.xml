</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Human imaging studies reveal an underlying disruption in the reward systems in addictive behaviors including alcohol use disorder and binge eating [1], [2], [3] and common neurobiological mechanisms may underlie these diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recently, ghrelin and its receptor (GHS-R1A) have been implied for such roles [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The gastric-derived orexigenic peptide, ghrelin [7], affects brain circuits involved in energy balance [8] as well as in reward [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Indeed, ghrelin activates an important reward circuit involved in natural- as well as drug-induced reward, the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This reward link encompasses a dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (N.Acc.) that forms part of the mesolimbic dopamine system, together with a cholinergic projection from the laterodorsal tegmental area (LDTg) to the VTA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin may, via activation of this reward link, increase the incentive value of motivated behaviors such as food and drug seeking [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Supportively, alcohol-, cocaine- as well as amphetamine-induced reward, as measured by locomotor activity, accumbal dopamine release and conditioned place preference, are suppressed by ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1A) antagonism [5], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Further, genetic, pharmacologic and surgical rodent models of altered ghrelin signalling has been used to show that ghrelin action at the level of the VTA is important for the intake of and motivation to obtain palatable/rewarding food [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of a common reward mechanism for alcohol and sweet substances also transfers to humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, alcohol dependent individuals have higher craving for sweets than do healthy controls [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The hedonic response to sweet taste may, at least in part, depend on genetic factors [15] which have been shown in both humans and animals in numerous studies [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], and is modulated via several mechanisms, which include the mesolimbic dopamine system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Specifically, sweet tasting substances (both caloric and non-caloric) increases the firing of accumbal dopamine [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to translate the preclinical data regarding ghrelin, sucrose and alcohol into humans, a group of alcohol-consuming individuals selected from a population cohort was investigated for genetic variants of the ghrelin signalling system in relation to both their alcohol and sucrose consumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effects of GHS-R1A antagonism on voluntary sucrose- intake and operant self-administration, as well as saccharin intake were investigated in preclinical studies using rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To exclude the possibility of taste aversion by the GHS-R1A antagonist, such experiments were conducted in mice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In the present study we found associations with the haplotype AGACGT, and its shorter version, GACGT, in the GHRL and increased sucrose consumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The haplotype GACGT was associated with increased sucrose intake in all individuals included in the study, and a trend for the same association was specifically seen in the high alcohol consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The nearly identical haplotype, AGACGT, in the GHRL was associated with high sucrose intake in male subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The preclinical data show that the GHS-R1A antagonist reduces the intake of sucrose as well as saccharin in rodents, as well as decreases self-administration of sucrose in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that the GHS-R1A antagonist did not induce a taste aversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Finally, the present study shows that peripheral ghrelin administration increases the intake of sucrose in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this suggests that ghrelin signalling, including the GHS-R1A, is important for regulation of the consumption of rewarding substances in general, and that this is independent of both the caloric content and any aversive effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In the genetic part of this study, an association between a GHRL haplotype and higher sucrose intake, particularly in males, was found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This is in line with previous studies where male gender specifically predicts a high preference for sweets [14], [39], and that sweet preference is a highly genetically determined trait [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Even though the effect size of this association was quite modest and the functional significance of this haplotype is yet unknown, it may be suggested that the associated ghrelin-encoding polymorphisms might influence the ability of the ghrelin signalling system to regulate the intake of rewarding substances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Supportively, in the preclinical experiments, we showed that pharmacological suppression of the GHS-R1A reduced high sucrose consumption as well as operant self-administration of sucrose in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Further, peripheral administration of ghrelin increased the intake and preference of sucrose in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Supportively, it was recently shown that ghrelin (administered centrally as well as peripherally) increases whereas GHS-R1A antagonism suppresses the motivation to consume sucrose [37] and that central grelin administration increase the intake of sucrose in rats [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Given that the orexigenic peptide, ghrelin, regulates energy balance [8], the reduced sucrose intake may be related to its caloric content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>However, this appears less likely since we here show that GHS-R1A antagonism decreases consumption of saccharin, a non-caloric sweetener, in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Recently, peripheral ghrelin administration was shown to increase the consumption of saccharin in wild type but not GHS-R1A knockout mice [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that JMV2959 did not induce a taste aversion in mice, as LiCl does, suggesting that the reduced intake of sweet substances is due to suppressed reward mechanisms rather than aversion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>A trend for an association between the GHRL haplotype, AGACGT, and higher sucrose intake was also seen specifically for the group with higher alcohol consumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>As this study investigated a sample of individuals from a population cohort, this trend needs to be further investigated in an alcohol dependent population with a higher alcohol intake and possible co-morbid eating disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>These data are, however, of interest since previously published studies show a positive correlation with the response to sweet taste and excessive alcohol intake in humans [18], [41], and that SNPs and haplotypes of both the GHRL and GHSR have been associated with increased weight in alcohol dependent individuals [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Moreover, animals bred for high saccharin preference show increased alcohol consumption compared to low saccharin-preferring animals [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Given that human imaging studies also reveal an underlying disruption in the reward systems in addictive behaviors, including alcohol use disorder and binge eating [1], [2], [3], we suggest that underlying neurobiological mechanisms for such addictive behaviors include central ghrelin signalling at the level of the reward systems, such as the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>From both preclinical and clinical data it now seems clear that central ghrelin signalling, including both the peptide ghrelin and its receptor, have a role in reward regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Indeed, here we showed that ghrelin increases whereas GHS-R1A antagonist reduced the intake and self-administration of sucrose in fed rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Additionally, recent studies show that ghrelin increases the intake of sucrose in rats fed ad libitum as well as in rats subjected to mild food restriction [37], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cocaine-seeking is associated with elevated plasma levels of ghrelin and a peripheral ghrelin injection enhances cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation and conditioned place preference [44], [45], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ghrelin administration in to the brain ventricles or into the VTA or LDTg, important reward nodes, increases alcohol consumption in mice [5] and the alcohol-induced locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine releases is attenuated in ghrelin knockout mice [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Further, ghrelin increases foraging in rats [47] and enhances the activity of reward-related brain nodes in humans subjected to food-related cues [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In human genetic studies a GHRL haplotype has been associated with paternal heredity of alcohol-use disorder [27], of increased weight in alcohol dependent individuals [26], as well as with increased sucrose consumption, as shown in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Regarding the GHS-R1A, it was recently shown that GHS-R1A suppression reduces the intake of as well as the motivation to obtain palatable food [6] and attenuates alcohol-, cocaine-, and amphetamine-induced reward, as measured by locomotor activity, accumbal dopamine release and conditioned place preference [5], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Further central or peripheral administration of a GHS-R1A antagonist reduces alcohol consumption as well as self-administration of alcohol in both mice and rats [5], [34], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Supportively, present and recent studies have shown that GHS-R1A antagonism decreases the intake of sweet substances in rodents [37], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Associations with one SNP and of haplotypes in GHSR and alcohol consumption, increased weight in alcohol dependent individuals, as well as with smoking in female alcohol dependence have been shown [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Conclusively, these clinical and preclinical findings suggest that ghrelin signalling may regulate both the intake of and search for rewarding substances, and a possible role for ghrelin signalling in patients with multiple addictions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>It now seems clear that ghrelin activates the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link and that ghrelin thereby increase the incentive value for motivated behaviors i.e. reward-seeking [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Given that the present and recent studies show that ghrelin increase and that the GHS-R1A antagonist reduces the intake of sucrose in rats [37], [38], it should be considered that the role of ghrelin signaling for the consumption of sweets is related to the endogenous peptide ghrelin and/or to the GHS-R1A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>However, the specific mechanisms through which ghrelin signalling may regulate the intake of rewarding substances need to be further elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that ghrelin amplifies dopamine signalling in the mesolimbic dopamine system through cross-talk involving heterodimerization of GHS-R1A and dopamine D1-like receptors, receptors co-localized on dopaminergic neurons in the VTA [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that the GHS-R1A via its constitutive activity regulates the sensitivity of the mesolimbic dopamine system, and the ability of drugs of abuse to activate this system [51]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed that haplotypes in the GHRL are associated with increased sucrose consumption in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>We also showed that a GHS-R1A antagonist reduces the consumption of both sucrose and saccharin, as well as the self-administration of sucrose in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data provide a clear indication that the central ghrelin signalling system, via GHS-R1A, is involved in regulating the intake of rewarding substance and hence, provides a novel target for the development of drug strategies to treat addictive behaviors. </plain></SENT>
