In human H441 airway epithelial cells, incubation of cells with 15&#160;&#181;g ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup> LPS caused a significant reduction in amiloride-sensitive <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub> from 15&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2 to 8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#160;&#181;A cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.01, <italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;13) and a shift in IC<sub>50</sub> amiloride of currents from 6.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;7</sup> to 6.4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>&#160;M. This effect was associated with a decrease in the activity of 5&#160;pS, highly Na<sup>+</sup> selective, amiloride-sensitive &lt;1&#160;&#181;M channels (HSC) and an increase in the activity of &#8764;18&#160;pS, nonselective, amiloride-sensitive &gt;10&#160;&#181;M cation channels (NSC) in the apical membrane. LPS decreased &#945;ENaC mRNA and protein abundance, inferring that LPS inhibited &#945;ENaC gene expression. This correlated with the decrease in HSC activity, indicating that these channels, but not NSCs, were comprised of at least &#945;ENaC protein. LPS increased NF-&#954;B DNA binding activity and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2, but decreased phosphorylation of ERK5 in H441 cells. Pretreatment of monolayers with PD98059 (20&#160;&#181;M) inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, promoted phosphorylation of ERK5, increased &#945;ENaC protein abundance, and reversed the effect of LPS on <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub> and the shift in amiloride sensitivity. Inhibitors of NF-&#954;B activation were without effect. Taken together, our data indicate that LPS acts via ERK signaling pathways to decrease &#945;ENaC transcription, reducing HSC/ENaC channel abundance, activity, and transepithelial Na<sup>+</sup> transport in H441 airway epithelial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Na<sup>+</sup> channel</kwd><kwd>Lung</kwd><kwd>Airway</kwd><kwd>Amiloride</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>ERK</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer-Verlag 2010</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In lung disease states, particularly cystic fibrosis, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a common opportunistic pathogen which can cause exacerbation of the existing condition. Such infections can lead to inflammation and damage to the epithelial barrier. This can result in increased fluid leak from the underlying tissues into the lumen of the conducting airways and the distal alveoli contributing to the formation of pulmonary edema. Evidence has indicated that bacterial and viral infections also modify the ion transport processes that control lung fluid homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These processes maintain the correct hydration of the luminal surface of the airway for optimal function of the mucociliary escalator as part of the airway defense against infection and the alveolar surface to maintain efficient gas exchange. The vectorial transport of Na<sup>+</sup> across the lung epithelium via amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels drives the osmotic movement of fluid from the lumen to the interstitium. Two populations of amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable cation channels have been described in the membrane of human H441 airway epithelial cells, alveolar type I and type II cells that could contribute to apical Na<sup>+</sup> conductance (G<sub>Na+</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and these have been described as a highly Na<sup>+</sup> selective of 5&#160;pS conductance channel that is inhibited by &lt;1&#160;&#181;M amiloride (HSC) and a nonselective cation channel of &#8764;18&#160;pS conductance that is inhibited by &gt;10&#160;&#181;M amiloride (NSC). The relative expression of these channels in alveolar type II are determined by culture conditions and the cellular abundance of protein subunits of the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The HSC is thought to comprise &#945;ENaC, &#946;ENaC, and &#947;ENaC in heterotrimeric combination, while the NSC has been reported to require only &#945;ENaC. As these channels are essential for the regulation of lung fluid homeostasis, then factors that alter their expression and function could potentially lead to a decrease in net fluid absorption and contribute to aberrant fluid homeostasis in the airway and the formation of pulmonary edema in the distal lung.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present in the coat proteins of many bacterial pathogens including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are potent inducers of the secretion and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, reactive oxygen species, and NO production via the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While the release of factors into the medium by LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages has been shown to inhibit ENaC expression in fetal distal lung epithelial cells via a NO-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and TNF-&#945; has been demonstrated to decrease ENaC mRNA expression in adult rat alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the effects of LPS applied directly to airway epithelial cells have not been fully explored. In this paper, we have used the human H441 airway epithelial cell line, which has Clara cell-like properties, to show that LPS inhibits amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> transport and alters the amiloride sensitivity of the monolayer by reducing the function of HSCs in the apical membrane. We have also used a combination of pharmacological and molecular techniques to characterize the role of NF-&#954;B and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1, 2, and 5 (ERK1, ERK2, and ERK5) in these LPS-mediated effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>H441 cells (obtained from ATCC, USA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, UK) supplemented with 2&#160;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) fetal bovine serum (Immune Systems, UK) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin; Life Technologies, UK).

Interestingly, decreased HSC function correlated with reduced transepithelial Na<sup>+</sup> transport and would indicate that HSCs are the principal route of entry for Na<sup>+</sup> across the apical membrane of H441 cells. Furthermore, while our data indicate that NSCs also transport Na<sup>+</sup>, their functional significance and contribution to Na<sup>+</sup> transport in the airway requires further exploration.</p><p>Amiloride-sensitive channels with differing kinetics, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity, and amiloride sensitivity can be a product of differential ENaC subunit combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In rat ATII cells, the presence of &#945;ENaC, &#946;ENaC, and &#947;ENaC subunits favored the expression of HSCs with a low EC<sub>50</sub> for amiloride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], while NSCs were proposed to be a product of &#945;ENaC alone or in dimeric combination with either &#946;ENaC or &#947;ENaC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The H441 cells in this study expressed &#945;ENaC, &#946;ENaC, and &#947;ENaC mRNA and &#945;ENaC protein. We have previously shown that &#946;ENaC and &#947;ENaC are also present in the membrane of these cells, consistent with HSC activity and the low EC<sub>50</sub> for amiloride we observed in control monolayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Work in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes showed that &#945;ENaC is necessary to produce functional channels at the cell surface and that maximal amiloride-sensitive current was achieved with a &#945;ENaC, &#946;ENaC, and &#947;ENaC combination and when the &#945; and/or &#947; subunits are protease cleaved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our finding that &#945;ENaC in the apical membrane was cleaved and that LPS decreased mRNA and abundance of cleaved and noncleaved protein would, therefore, support the observed decrease in the number of functional HSC channels and reduction in amiloride-sensitive <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub>. Similar findings have been described in alveolar epithelial cells and distal lung epithelial cells from the fetal rat where LPS inhibited ENaC mRNA expression and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the decreased abundance of &#945;ENaC was inversely related to the frequency of observation and activity of NSCs. Our interpretation of this result is that NSCs are unlikely to be a product of &#945;ENaC protein. In support of this notion, previous studies showed that antisense oligonucleotides to &#945;ENaC, &#946;ENaC, or &#947;ENaC decreased the observed frequency of HSCs but did not significantly affect the frequency of NSCs in ATII cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The identity of NSCs in H441 cells and how their observed frequency is increased by LPS, therefore, remains to be confirmed.</p><p>LPS has been shown to act through a number of cell signaling pathways to modulate gene expression (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). We found that LPS increased binding of NF-&#954;B to a consensus sequence found in the promoter region of human &#945;ENaC. Activation of MAP kinase pathways, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and activation of NF-&#954;B have both been shown to modulate the transcription and activity of &#945;ENaC in lung and renal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Treatment with SAS, an inhibitor of I&#954;B phosphorylation and NF-&#954;B binding activity, prevented LPS-mediated NF-&#954;B activation but did not reverse the suppressive effect of LPS on amiloride-sensitive currents in these cells. In addition, CAPE, which prevents translocation of NF-&#954;B to the nucleus, had no effect. In support of our findings, SAS did not reverse TNF-&#945; suppression of &#945;ENaC mRNA levels in type II epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>LPS has been shown to stimulate both ERK1/2 and ERK 5 in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We found that LPS induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but decreased phosphorylation of ERK5. While we cannot rule out any effect of the treatments on ERK1/2 and ERK5 abundance, few roles for ERK5 have been described in the lung and the opposing changes in phosphorylation we have demonstrated infer that LPS differentially regulates these two kinases in H441 cells. Such differential regulation of ERK5 and ERK1/2 has been described in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and ERK5 activation was shown to be enhanced when ERK1/2 signaling was suppressed in NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consistent with the findings of Kamakura et al., the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 prevented LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and the decrease in phosphorylation of ERK5, reversed the suppressive effect of LPS on amiloride-sensitive <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub>, increased &#945;ENaC protein abundance, and restored amiloride sensitivity to that of untreated control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Taken together, these data infer that inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and/or increased ERK5 phosphorylation were, at least in part, important mediators of the LPS effect on Na<sup>+</sup> transport.</p><p>We observed that LPS reduced &#945;ENaC mRNA and decreased protein abundance in this study and inhibited transcriptional activity of the &#945;ENaC promoter in A549 lung epithelial cells in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Both ERK1/2 and ERK5 have been described to mediate changes in gene transcription in lung cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and there is good evidence that transcriptional effects as a result of rapid ERK phosphorylation are maximal several hours later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. ERK-sensitive pathways disrupted glucocorticoid transactivation of the &#945;ENaC promoter in A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and decreased &#945;-ENaC mRNA expression in rat parotid epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, cross-talk between ERK and cAMP activation of CREB regulated &#945;ENaC mRNA abundance in rat submandibular gland epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, we propose that LPS inhibits &#945;ENaC mRNA transcription by the activation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of ERK5. However, the pathways and the specific roles of ERK1/2 versus ERK5 in H441 cells remain to be defined.</p><p>Direct ERK2 phosphorylation of &#946; and &#947;ENaC subunits has been shown to facilitate their interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, promoting a decrease in functional channels at the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addition, activation of ERK2 by progesterone or a vasopressin-induced factor (VIP32) downregulated ENaC activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes via a decrease in channel open probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. If LPS activation of ERK1/2 mediated the effects on <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, they would be expected to precede changes in transcription and &#945;ENaC abundance. As we were unable to demonstrate any significant functional effects within 4&#160;h, we do not think this is a likely route of LPS action. We cannot, however, rule out an action of endogenously active ERK1/2 on channel <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>. Neither do we exclude additional effects of LPS on mRNA and protein stability or the release of factors including TNF-&#945; (a proinflammatory cytokine) which has also been shown to decrease ENaC mRNA and activity in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, using a combination of techniques, we have demonstrated novel effects of LPS applied directly to human airway epithelial cells. We propose that LPS acts via ERK signaling pathways to decrease &#945;ENaC transcription, reduce HSC/ENaC channel abundance, activity, and transepithelial Na<sup>+</sup> transport in H441 airway epithelial cells. Such changes could potentially lead to a decrease in net fluid absorption and contribute to the formation of pulmonary edema as a result of bacterial infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Chong Tan and Susan Dunford for their contributions to this work and the Wellcome Trust (068674/Z/02) and BBSRC (BB/E013597/1) for their support.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollhead</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Mace</surname><given-names>OJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Baines</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>AICAR decreases the activity of two distinct amiloride-sensitive Na+-permeable channels in H441 human lung epithelial cell monolayers</article-title><source>Am J Physiol</source><year>2008</year><volume>295</volume><fpage>L837</fpage><lpage>L848</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Baines DL, Janes M (2003) Effect of LPS-induced NF-&#954;B activity on the transcriptional response of a 5&#8242; flanking region of the &#945;ENaC gene.
