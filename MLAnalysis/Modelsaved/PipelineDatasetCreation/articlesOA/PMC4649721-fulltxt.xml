Closed-loop (CL) systems, which use a control algorithm to direct insulin delivery autonomously in a glucose-responsive manner by coupling a real-time subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin delivery by a pump, may transform the management of type 1 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Over the past decade, CL research has made incremental progress from studies performed in clinical research facility and transitional settings to the home environment.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#8211;5</xref></sup> Unsupervised home studies provide the ultimate test bed for CL systems and reflect daily life conditions without intervention or monitoring by researchers. As modulation of insulin delivery is based on CGM sensor glucose levels, sensor performance is important in determining the efficacy and safety of CL systems.</p><p>Accuracy of commercially available CGM devices has improved over the years. Glucose sensor accuracy studies in ambulatory patients at home have reported mean absolute relative difference (MARD), a statistical measure of the difference between two related measures, of around 12&#8211;19%.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> At least 80% of measurements from current CGM devices lie within Zone A and B, deemed clinically accurate or benign errors, of the Clarke error grid (CEG) analysis.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, glucose sensor accuracy in the hypoglycemic range as assessed by MARD is known to be worse compared with during euglycemia.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There are few published reports of CGM performance during CL studies. Unsupervised crossover home studies provide a unique opportunity to assess accuracy of real-time CGM across all glycemic ranges during standard therapy and CL insulin delivery in an environment reflecting the user's free-living home conditions.</p><p>The present study assessed the accuracy of the Freestyle Navigator<sup>&#174;</sup> II real-time CGM (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) during two overnight<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and one day-and-night<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> unsupervised CL home studies under free-living conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s002"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-one adults (18 females, 23 males) and 16 adolescents (six females, 10 males) with type 1 diabetes were recruited as part of CL home studies in these two cohorts.

Each study period lasted 4 (adults) or 3 (adolescents) weeks in the overnight CL studies and 1 week in the day-and-night CL study.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#8211;12</xref></sup> Identical study insulin pump and real-time CGMs were used during the two study periods, which were separated by a 3&#8211;4-week washout period, during which participants used their own pump and discontinued continuous glucose monitoring.</p><p>Participants were not restricted in dietary intake or daily activities during either CL or control periods.

Participants were instructed on the insertion and use of the continuous glucose monitoring system following enrollment into the study. During the CL and control periods, participants were instructed to calibrate the sensor according to the manufacturer's instructions using the built-in Freestyle glucose meter. In addition, during the CL period participants were advised to recalibrate the sensor before going to bed (overnight and day-and-night CL use) or in the morning (day-and-night CL use) if the sensor was over-reading by more than 3.0&#8201;mmol/L.

Our analysis suggests that in ambulatory real-life conditions, the Freestyle Navigator II CGM achieved nearly comparable MARD scores with those reported in the manufacturer's labeling and in controlled research facility settings.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The reliability and consistency of CGM performance are particularly important in CL home studies. As expected and shown in other studies, the Freestyle Navigator II CGM was less accurate in the hypoglycemic range compared with the euglycemic range when measured by ARD (MARD, 30.6% vs. 13.9%), but absolute difference was comparable (mean, 0.9 vs. 0.9&#8201;mmol/L). Nonetheless, the accuracy measured by MARD was higher in the hyperglycemic range, and the Bland&#8211;Altman plot demonstrated relatively few variations in sensor accuracy over the range of measured glucose concentrations. Sensor accuracy was not found to be significantly different between participants in the euglycemic and hyperglycemic range, when insulin delivery is actively modulated by the control algorithm. From a CL perspective, this facilitates safer operation of CL by avoiding hypoglycemia resulting from sensor over-reading, whereas this risk is mitigated in the hypoglycemia range as insulin delivery is suspended by the algorithm. The clinical relevance of the accuracy analysis is further substantiated by the percentage values in Zone A and B of the CEG analysis, suggesting that over 95% of the input data to the control algorithm from CGM had led to either clinically appropriate decisions or avoided inappropriate treatment.</p><p>Previously published CGM accuracy studies were mostly performed in clinical research facility settings.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Experimental conditions in inpatient studies do not fully reflect free-living conditions, although such studies benefit from gold-standard reference glucose measurements. Some studies do not assess CGM performance across all glycemia ranges.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> An inpatient head-to-head comparison study reported superior overall accuracy for the Navigator CGM, when compared with the Dexcom<sup>&#174;</sup> Seven<sup>&#174;</sup> Plus (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA; the latter superseded by Dexcom G4&#8482; Platinum) and the Guardian<sup>&#174;</sup> (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) (now superseded by the Enlite&#8482; sensor).<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> When paired with venous glucose measured by the GlucoScout&#8482; (International Biomedical, Austin, TX), the percentage points in Zone A of the CEG were comparable to our analysis (80.6%). Another recent inpatient study compared the Navigator, Dexcom G4 Platinum, and Enlite CGM sensors.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Using venous glucose as reference, the Navigator and Dexcom G4 Platinum had the best overall accuracy (MARD, 12.3% and 10.8%, respectively).</p><p>Direct comparability to assess CGM performance during home use of CL can be challenging, as inpatient studies commonly use plasma or venous glucose as reference measurements or for calibration. Such conditions are not practical in routine clinical practice, and participants would normally rely on capillary glucose measurements. Based on the limited number of published reports on CGM performance in the home environment, data from our analysis are comparable. Kropff et al.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> compared the accuracy of the Dexcom G4 Platinum and Medtronic Enlite CGM system during 6 days of home use. The overall accuracy in the home setting was better for the Dexcom G4 Platinum compared with the Enlite (MARD, 12.2&#177;12.0% vs. 19.9&#177;20.5%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p><p>These findings were complemented by another ambulatory head-to-head CGM home comparison study by Matuleviciene et al.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The accuracy of a modified Dexcom G4 Platinum system with an enhanced calibration algorithm was recently assessed over 7 days.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The MARD during home use was 11.3%, with 92.4% in CEG Zone A. These studies were of a shorter duration and had fewer numbers of CGM&#8211;capillary glucose reference pairs available for analysis, especially in the hypoglycemia range. To our knowledge, no other CL home studies of similar duration have published data related to CGM accuracy and performance.</p><p>The incidence and duration of large sensor errors are other important determinants that may impact on the efficacy and safety of a CL system. Although a continuous error grid analysis has been specifically developed to evaluate CGM performance,<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> such a measurement tool has yet to be used widely and does not provide information about the duration, severity, and incidence of large sensor errors. A recent study quantifying the incidence and duration of large inaccuracy found that the Freestyle Navigator was safer for CL use compared with the Dexcom Seven Plus.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Although the Dexcom Seven Plus has been superseded by Dexcom G4 Platinum with comparable performance to FreeStyle Navigator in terms of large sensor errors,<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> the report highlights the unmet need of having additional measures to assess CGM performance and reliability during CL operation.</p><p>Determining individual-level factors associated with reduced accuracy would help identify strategies to optimize sensor performance. Post hoc analysis of our results revealed that individuals with the most time spent in the hypoglycemia range had lower MARD overall. This is consistent with findings of lower MARD in the hypoglycemia range and may potentially contribute to bias in studies reporting primarily on hypoglycemia reduction outcomes. Further work is needed to determine individual-level factors influencing sensor performance and impact on CL performance.</p><p>The strengths of the present analysis are real-world settings and the large dataset spanning a broad age range and geographical locations. We assessed sensor accuracy across a wide glycemic range experienced by participants during free-living conditions. Capillary glucose data used in the analysis were obtained directly from the capillary blood glucose meter built-in within the Freestyle Navigator CGM, thereby eliminating timing and transcription errors and standardizing device use. The limitations include pre-analytical errors associated with fingerstick capillary glucose testing at home, which may lead to erroneous measurements and calibration. However, participants were instructed to perform hand washing before performing fingerstick testing as per usual clinical practice.</p><p>In summary, we observed high and consistent numerical and clinical accuracy of the Freestyle Navigator II CGM in the nonhypoglycemic range during home use in CL studies during free-living conditions. In the hyperglycemic range, the improved numerical accuracy facilitates safe operation of CL by avoiding hypoglycemia from CGM sensor over-reading. Conversely, sensor inaccuracy at the hypoglycemic range is mitigated by insulin delivery suspension during CL operation. Our analysis supports use of the Freestyle Navigator in unsupervised CL home studies and may contribute toward establishing CGM performance criteria for home use of CL systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Fig1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1013" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1018" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1023" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s012" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to study volunteers for their participation.
