Disseminated tuberculosis is associated with compromised cell-mediated immunity and the bacteremic form is rapidly fatal in a large proportion of HIV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Early recognition and treatment are likely to be important in improving patient outcomes. Although research has identified a number of clinical and laboratory features that may assist with recognition of patients with bacteremic disseminated tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], non-specific clinical findings and lack of typical features of pulmonary tuberculosis complicate diagnosis.

However, these studies have focused primarily on pulmonary tuberculosis, leaving unanswered questions about the timing and impact of ART in patients with confirmed disseminated tuberculosis.

Unlike studies of disseminated tuberculosis done among febrile patients, we did not detect an association between cough, fever, or weight loss and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteremia. This is probably because A5221 enrolled tuberculosis suspects who would be expected to have cough, fever, or weight loss irrespective of the co-occurrence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteremia.</p><p>The case fatality ratio of patients with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteremia was much lower in A5221 than in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and there were no significant differences in survival or AIDS-free survival of HIV and tuberculosis co-infected patients by mycobacteremia status. Possible explanations for the better outcomes observed in this study include that A5221 entry criteria would have excluded the most severely ill patients; initiation of ART and tuberculosis treatment may have been more timely in the clinical trial than would be the case under program conditions; and that some patients with occult presentations of disseminated tuberculosis could have been overlooked through a focus on features of clinical tuberculosis. The lack of differences in survival and AIDS-free survival between the groups may suggest that mycobacteremia does not have the prognostic value in the HIV-infected tuberculosis suspect population that it does in the febrile illness population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or may simply be due to lack of power to detect a difference.</p><p>The higher total body mycobacterial load assumed to be present in patients with the bacteremic disseminated form of tuberculosis combined with rapid ART-associated immune reconstitution has been suggested to increase the risk for IRIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The use of mycobacterial blood culture during the baseline evaluation of ACTG protocol A5221 varied considerably by site and was at the discretion of the site team. This could have introduced bias.

Tuberculosis suspects with mycobacteremia were more likely to convert their sputum smear from positive at baseline to negative at week 8, but did not otherwise significantly differ by outcome compared to those without <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteremia. Most notably, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteremia did not appear to be associated with increased risk for IRIS despite the high proportion achieving virologic suppression and CD4 count increases &#8805;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> at week 48. However, larger studies with standardized and consistent use of mycobacterial blood culture are needed to confirm the findings of our analysis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declared that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#8217; contributions</bold></p><p>JAC and SS conceived of the study.
