Three categories were typical. The &#8220;missing scans&#8221; were the cases in which these OCT images were either not acquired in the first place (mostly occurred at the 3- and/or 6-month visits) or not successfully converted from the proprietary image format to a format readable by our algorithms. &#8220;Bad scans&#8221; represent the OCT scans with bad image quality, so the layer segmentation algorithm failed to process them. Typical situations included: (1) the images had severe motion artifacts, (2) the centers of these images were off from the ONH center, or (3) the images had random regions with extremely low intensity. &#8220;Wrong scans&#8221; were only applicable for the HD-5LR scans. These scans were inaccurately acquired using macular protocol instead of the required ONH-centered protocol. To fairly compare the pRPE/BM shape measure with the other OCT measures (i.e., the pRNFL and pTR thicknesses, and the ONH volume) in both treatment groups at the baseline, 3, and 6-month follow-ups, the subjects who did not have complete measurements from both OCT image protocols and longitudinal time points were further excluded. The number of subjects with complete OCT measures at all three visits in the acetazolamide group and placebo group were 39/62 (62.9%) and 31/63 (49.2%), respectively; this data set will be referred to as the &#8220;complete data set&#8221; in the following sections.

Most of the change in shape of Bruch's membrane occurred during the 3 months of acetazolamide therapy, whereas no significant shape change occurred in the placebo group during the study period. Quantitative assessment of the pRPE/BM shape and subsequent change of the pRPE/BM shape appears to be another potential biomarker used to measure the success of treatment of raised ICP.

Several reasons resulted in the data exclusion including performing wrong OCT exams, incorrectly centered OCT images, truncation of markedly swollen ONH and peripapillary retina, and incomplete data for all three visits.</p><p>One future aspect of this work will be to replace the manual step of placing the BMO landmarks with a fully automated analysis. Although the semiautomated method in this study was a significant improvement, reducing the necessary amount of manual landmarks required from 20 landmarks in the traditional manual method<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2554-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> to only two landmarks in the semiautomated method,<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2554-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> there still exists a need to develop a fully automated method to make the pRPE/BM shape analysis available for data sets without any sample size limitation<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-58-5-2554-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and without the need for acquiring high density raster scans. Another future direction is to extend the current 2D pRPE/BM shape analysis into a 3D analysis, in which the pRPE/BM opening landmarks are able to be sampled on the entire pRPE/BM surface in an ONH SD-OCT volume rather than just one HD 2D B-scan. A 3D pRPE/SM shape model is expected to have promising advantages because it potentially will have significantly more landmarks than the 2D models have (e.g., hundreds of landmarks in a 3D shape versus 20 landmarks in a 2D shape) and will incorporate 3D contextual information. We also plan to determine whether automated analysis showing pRPE/BM shape changes can accurately reflect the dynamic process occurring at the ONH and reflect changes in CSF pressure from therapy or failed intervention. The hope is that this OCT measure can provide an in vivo noninvasive measure of significant increases or decreases in ICH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>A part of this work was presented at the ARVO 2015 annual meeting.</p><p>Supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants U10 EY017281-01A1, U10 EY017387-01A1, 3U10EY017281-01A1S1, R01 EY023279, Unrestricted Grant from Research to Prevent Blindness, C9251-C, Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development (RR&amp;D), Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development (VA-ORD), Iowa City VA Center for The Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>J.-K.
