</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the last 20 years, the chemotherapy treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy in children, has reached success rates of up to 90%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This achievement has allowed limiting the administration of damaging cranial irradiation to rare cases with central nervous system (CNS) infiltration (Laningham et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical routine of chemotherapy treatments in these patients includes intrathecal and high intravenous doses of various drugs with a highly toxic profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is therefore a source of a wide variety of complications that add up to those caused by peripheral blood cell depression or the disease itself (Vagace and Gervasini, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In fact, the toxicity of chemotherapy is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children with ALL, as well as a frequent source of sequelae at mid-long term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These adverse effects are often the consequence of direct toxicity in healthy tissue, as a result of the low specificity displayed by these drugs and become more frequent as the treatment is intensified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In particular, central neurotoxicity is a major clinical concern in pediatric patients (Vagace et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, it is obvious that any factor able to modify either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of chemotherapy drugs holds the potential to be critical for the occurrence of serious adverse effects in ALL patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>One such factor is the presence of genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Genetic association studies in this field have traditionally been focused on efficacy parameters in general and survival in particular and therefore the body of work on the association with toxicity is still scarce. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In this review we will summarize what is currently known about how genetic variability can affect the toxicity induced by the main drugs used in the chemotherapy of ALL (see summary in Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A special focus will be put on the discussion on those genetic analyses with the potential to tailor chemotherapy regimes in the ALL setting. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>L-asparaginase is a standard component in the initial treatment of childhood ALL which induces the depletion of the essential amino acid L-asparagine in the tumor cells resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This drug has been related to serious adverse effects in ALL patients, such as acute pancreatitis (Flores-Calderon et al., 2009) or cerebrovascular accidents (Gugliotta et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, hypersensitivity reactions occur in up to 25% of the patients and 10% of those may experience life-threatening anaphylactic reactions (Cortijo-Cascajares et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Studies on the pharmacogenetics of asparaginase in ALL are in their early stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A large study recently carried out at St Jude Children’s Hospital by Chen et al. (2010) interrogated more than 500 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 485 children with ALL and found that five mutations (rs4958351, rs10070447, rs6890057, rs4958676, and rs6889909) in the GRIA1 gene were associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity to the drug. GRIA1 encodes a subunit of the AMPA receptor, a tetrameric ligand-gated ion channel that transmits glutamatergic signals in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Glutamate not only has a role as a neurotransmitter, but also as an immunomodulator (Pacheco et al., 2007) and the study by Chen et al. (2011) provides the first link between GRIA1 polymorphisms and an immune-related phenotype such as the occurrence of hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A later genome-wide study by the same group using the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines tested more than 2 million SNPs and identified the aspartate metabolic routes as the most likely candidate pathway for asparaginase sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Finally, polymorphisms in other genes that mediate the antileukemic effect of asparaginase, such as the asparaginase synthetase gene (ASNS), the basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), or the argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), have been associated to lower event-free survival of ALL patients, albeit the authors reported no associations with adverse effects (Rousseau et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Cyclophosphamide, an oxazophosphorine, bifunctional DNA alkylating agent, is crucial in the treatment of most pediatric and adult malignancies, including ALL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Cyclophosphamide is bioactivated in the liver by various enzymes of the hepatic P450 system including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 (Cox, 1979; Parekh and Sladek, 1993; Dirven et al., 1994; Hayes and Pulford, 1995; Ludeman, 1999; Huang et al., 2000), whilst detoxification of active metabolites is mainly mediated by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1; Parekh and Sladek, 1993) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1; Hayes and Pulford, 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are known to have functional polymorphisms, some of which have been found to impact toxicity associated with cyclophosphamide-based therapies in several pathologies (Zhong et al., 2006; Cho et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>A study conducted in patients with leukemia who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation showed that carriers of CYP2B6*2A or CYP2B6*4 variant alleles treated with cyclophosphamide were at higher risk of developing hemorrhagic cystitis and oral mucositis, respectively (Rocha et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, at least the CYP2B6*4 variant has been related to increased enzyme activity (Lang et al., 2001; Kirchheiner et al., 2003), and presumably this could lead to increased bioactivation of the drug and therefore could explain the observed higher incidence of toxicity in the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Numerous other CYP2B6 alleles that have been associated with changes in the enzyme activity/expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm/">www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm</ext-link>) and therefore they could be relevant with regard to cyclophosphamide-induced side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It should also be remarked that the CYP2B6 gene exhibits a large intraethnic variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Indeed, novel allelic variants and different linkage disequilibrium values have been described in certain populations (Restrepo et al., 2011), which should be taking into account when implementing tailored genotyping protocols aimed to determine the potential of CYP2B6 as a biomarker of drug response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Allan et al. (2001) have reported that the 105Val allele of the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was overrepresented in a group of patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this association was only observed in therapies including GSTP1 substrates such as cyclophosphamide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that an overexposure to the drug due to reduced detoxification capabilities could have played a role in leukemogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the same variation of the GSTP1 gene has been suggested to be one of the factors determining a higher neurotoxicity of ifosfamide, a closely related agent (Zielinska et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A later report showed that the presence of the 677C-1298C haplotype in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene was also associated to secondary acute myeloid leukemia after cyclophosphamide treatment of hematologic malignancies (Guillem et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Other polymorphisms reportedly associated with increased cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity are CYP2C19*2 (Takada et al., 2004; Ngamjanyaporn et al., 2011), CYP3A4*1B (Su et al., 2010), GSTM1/T1 null (Cho et al., 2010), ALDH3A1*2 and ALDH1A1*2 (Ekhart et al., 2008), ABCC4 rs9561778 (Low et al., 2009), or ABCG2 Q141K (rs2231142; Kim et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>It should be stated that some of these studies were conducted in patients with hematological malignancies but there are as yet no available data on ALL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapeutic agent used in a broad array of malignancies, which somewhat hampers the reproducibility of these findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Therefore, larger studies and more consistent populations are needed in order to unequivocally establish the impact of the aforementioned SNPs and to identify other variants that could account for increased toxicity in cyclophosphamide-based therapies in ALL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>CYTOSINE ARABINOSIDE </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Cytosine arabinoside (Cytarabine, Ara-C) is an antimetabolite widely used in acute leukemia, which is associated with several adverse side effects, including myelosuppression, infections, mucositis, neurotoxicity, and acute pulmonary syndrome (Hartford et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Candidate gene approaches have been used to identify genetic variables that are important in susceptibility to Ara-C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>These studies have mainly focused on genes in the pharmacokinetic pathway of the drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>For instance, a common polymorphism, A79C (rs2072671), in the cytidine deaminase (CDA) gene, which catalyzes the rapid deamination of Ara-C, results in lower enzyme activity and hence a decreased rate of Ara-C metabolism (Kirch et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Bhatla et al. (2009) have shown that Ara-C-related mortality was significantly elevated in carriers of the 79CC genotype in children with acute leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Ciccolini et al. (2012) have related this SNP to life-threatening toxicities induced in a girl with lymphoma treated with Ara-C. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Hartford et al. (2009) utilized an unbiased whole-genome approach to find polymorphisms that might predict the susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of Ara-C in cell lines derived from persons of European (CEU) and African (YRI) ancestry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The authors identified a unique pharmacogenetic signature consisting of four SNPs explaining 51% of the variability in sensitivity to ara-C among the CEU and five SNPs explaining 58% of the variation among the YRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>These unique genetic signatures comprised novel target genes, most importantly GIT1, RAD51AP1, and SLC25A37, which can be studied further in functional studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors examined 64 SNPs in the deoxycytidine kinase gene (DCK), which catalyzes the most essential step in the Ara-C activation pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Their conclusions show that cells that carried the DCK A70G (Ile24Val) polymorphism, which affects protein function, had an increased sensitivity to Ara-C (Hartford et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In this regard, a later study has suggested that another DCK SNP, C-360G, is associated with the occurrence of mucositis after low-dose Ara-C in pediatric ALL patients (Banklau et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study by Xu et al. (2012) seems to confirm the importance of both CDA and DCK genes as important loci that should be further investigated regarding the outcome of Ara-C-based chemotherapy in leukemia patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>CYTOTOXIC ANTIBIOTICS </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Doxorubicin (adriamycin) and daunorubicin (daunomycin) are anthracycline antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of leukemias whose main concern is their well-known dose-related cardiotoxicity (Gilladoga et al., 1976). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The contribution of pharmacogenetic factors across the doxorubicin biochemical pathway is not well established, but the drug is characterized by inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and genetic variation has been suggested to account for at least part of this variability (Jamieson and Boddy, 2010; Lal et al., 2010).For instance, SNPs in the ABCB1 and SLC22A16 transporter genes have been shown to increase exposure levels that could result in a higher incidence of adverse effects (Lal et al., 2007, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>No studies on the impact of these mutations on the incidence of adverse effects in ALL patients have as yet been conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In patients of breast cancer treated with doxorubicin, Bray et al. (2010) have shown that several SNPs in the SLC22A16 influx transporter gene (A146G, T312C, and T755C) are related to lower incidence of dose delay, indicative of less toxicity; although it should be noted that the authors considered their own findings as preliminary. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vitro studies have shown that the wild-type allele of the Val88Ile (262G &gt; A, rs1143663) SNP in the carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) gene, involved in doxorubicin metabolism, exhibits a higher rate of synthesis of cardiotoxic metabolites (Gonzalez-Covarrubias et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The conclusions of this work seem to indicate that the small percentage of individuals of African ancestry (to which this SNP is confined) who are homozygous for the low-activity Ile88 allele would therefore be at lower risk of cardiotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, this would imply that a majority of the African population is at-risk for doxorubicin-induced toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Interestingly enough, a study by Hasan et al. (2004) evaluated 100 African American patients who underwent doxorubicin-based combination therapy and found that they appeared to suffer cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin three times more frequently than previously studied populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Because of the low sample size analyzed and the lack of head-to-head comparison, larger studies in a multiracial setting seem necessary to clarify this finding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>With regard to daunorubicin, a recent work has shown a trend toward significant increase in the drug systemic exposure in patients carrying the C-allele of the CBR1 G312C (Leu73Leu, rs25678) polymorphism, which could elevate the risk of drug-induced toxicity (Varatharajan et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In any case, it should be stated that the genetic associations reported for these two anthracyclines are still relatively recent and have not been consistently observed yet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Mitoxantrone is an anthracycline analog which is a known substrate for ABC efflux transporters such as those encoded by the ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes (Kodaira et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>To date, there are no studies in the ALL setting testing the plausible hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in these genes could affect mitoxantrone disposition and hence modulate the response and side effects to the drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>However, Cotte et al. (2009) have determined the frequencies of seven ABCB1 and ABCG2 SNPs in multiple sclerosis patients treated with mitoxantrone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Several associations were reported regarding the clinical response rate, but no relevant differences in genotype frequencies were observed in a subset of patients with severe hematological or cardiac side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>However, it was intriguing that one patient presenting cardiomyopathy after a low dose of mitoxantrone was found to carry an uncommon genotype with homozygous variant alleles in two ABCB1 (G2677T/A, rs2032582 and C3435T, rs1045642) and one ABCG2 locus (Gln141Lys, rs2231142), in addition to a variant allele for the ABCC2 C-24T (rs717620) SNP (Cotte et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>ETOPOSIDE </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor used in a variety of malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This drug is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein transporter, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoforms (Relling et al., 1994), whose expression is partly regulated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR; Drocourt et al., 2002), and a number of phase II metabolizing enzymes, including GSTs and UGT1A1 (Watanabe et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Therefore, alterations in these genes hold the potential to be relevant for the drug concentrations and clinical effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge there are as yet no studies investigating the association of polymorphisms in the etoposide pathways with the occurrence of adverse effects, mainly dose-limiting myelosuppression, in patients treated with the drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are only indications based on the impact of these genetic variations on the level of exposure to the drug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>For instance, a study in 109 children diagnosed with ALL showed that carriers of both the CYP3A5*3/*3 and GSTP1 Ile/Ile genotype displayed a lower drug clearance, although this association was only observed in African Americans one month after treatment (Kishi et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ABCB1 C3435T SNP was found to be an independent predictor of etoposide clearance disregarding ethnicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In contrast, one year after treatment, the UGT1A1 6/6 (*1/*1), VDR intron 8 GG and VDR Fok 1 CC genotypes predicted higher clearance in African Americans (Kishi et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Despite that the drug pharmacokinetics were shown to correlate with the incidence of adverse effects, no analyses of the association between SNPs and toxicity were conducted by the authors (Kishi et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Two genome-wide studies by an American research group have identified both genomic regions and SNPs associated with cellular sensitivity to etoposide. Huang et al. (2007) identified 63 genetic variants that contributed to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity through the evaluation of cell growth inhibition in cell lines from multi-generational pedigrees. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Finally, the G-80A polymorphism in the RFC1influx transporter, which determines intracellular levels of MTX, has been associated with increased overall toxicity in ALL patients (Shimasaki et al., 2006; Imanishi et al., 2007; Kishi et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The utility of pharmacogenetics in clinical routine has turned to be lower than anticipated, as numerous barriers to implementing individualized medicine have appeared over the years (Agundez et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Cases in which a genetic test is sufficient to significantly affect a given therapy are discouragingly uncommon (Groenen, 2011) and the leukemia setting is not an exception. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Indeed, only 1–2% of marketed drugs have pharmacogenomic-based recommendations (Agundez et al., 2012) and amongst the drugs commonly used in the chemotherapy of pediatric ALL, only 6-MP, thioguanine and azathioprine labels include genetic testing (TPMT) as a recommendation to help individualize therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, steps are being taken in order to revert this situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The increasing availability of low-cost, high-throughput genetic platforms that allow the simultaneous screening of hundreds of polymorphisms, the education of health practitioners or the implementation of multicenter networks aimed to improve the safety of new drugs, are some of the measures that hopefully will help improve the impact of pharmacogenetics on clinical routine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>It should also be pointed out that genetic variability in several of the targets for which genetic testing is recommended by the FDA and other corporations has been shown to modify the risk of acute leukemia (Agundez, 2004), which certainly enhances the utility of these tests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The body of work on the clinical impact of TPMT and MTHFR polymorphisms on ALL does not mirror the limited current knowledge on the pharmacogenetics of the other drugs that constitute the core of chemotherapy for this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Thus, significantly less information is available with regard to vincristine, asparaginase, cyclophosphamide etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The TPMT gene polymorphism provides the best example of the value of applied pharmacogenetics in ALL and clinical oncology in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It is now widely acknowledged that the initial dose of 6-MP treatment should be based on the TPMT genotype (Relling et al., 2011), thus allowing the clinician to identify patients at higher risk of toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>However, as it was described in the 6-MP chapter, there is still some interindividual variability in the response to this drug that cannot be explained only by the TPMT genotype (Palmieri et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the implementation of additional genetic analyses to identify polymorphisms in the ITPA, MTHFR, XO and other genes in the 6-MP intracellular pathway, as well as the study of their epistatic interactions seem to be reasonable steps to take in order to better adjust 6-MP doses in ALL patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, pharmacogenomics alone may not be sufficient to explain all the interindividual variability in 6-MP response and efforts should be undertaken in the coming years to create more precise algorithms that can help predict drug response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>With regard to MTHFR, the reasons for the present controversy regarding the influence of its genetic variation on MTX-induced toxicity are diverse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>For instance, the wide variety of diseases in which MTX has been proved useful has paradoxically hampered the reproducibility of the results of genetic association studies, because of the heterogeneity of the patients analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other unknown variants in the same gene, epistatic interactions with other genes and, most likely, the combination of these factors, may result in genetic backgrounds with different susceptibilities to MTX-induced toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The challenge seems to be to identify which genetic factors and genetic combinations are those in specific populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Some ALL chemotherapy regimens contemplate MTX dose reductions for subjects homozygous for the 677T variant or for those carrying both 677CT and 1298AC heterozygous genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>One could consider at least premature to make this kind of dose adjustments based on data that are still controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In fact, MTX was not included in the list of drugs mentioned in the Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Label issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year (FDA, 2011). It is probably naive to believe that the determination of SNPs in just one gene (MTHFR) belonging to a highly complex intracellular pathway, such as that of MTX, is enough to accurately anticipate the occurrence of adverse effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>As a general rule, it would be logical to think that the identification of combinations of mutations in several genes along the pathway of a given drug must be more helpful in terms of identifying subjects at-risk of toxicity than a single-SNP approach (Vagace et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This is crucial in the case of drugs with intricate intracellular routes as it is the case of MTX or 6-MP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide approaches such as the ones reported by (Huang et al., 2007), Bleibel et al. (2009), and Chen et al. (2011) are able to evaluate whole pathways to identify key routes that can be later studied in detail. </plain></SENT>
