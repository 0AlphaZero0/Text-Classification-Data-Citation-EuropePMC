<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently have shown in mice that the bone marrow (BM) may be a valid alternative to the liver, and here we report a pilot study to test feasibility and safety of BM as a site for islet transplantation in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients who developed diabetes after total pancreatectomy were candidates for the autologous transplantation of pancreatic islet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because the patients had contraindications for intraportal infusion, islets were infused in the BM. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The liver is the current site of choice for pancreatic islet transplantation, even though it is far from being ideal because of immunologic (2–4), anatomic (5), and metabolic (6–8) factors leading to significant early graft loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Along with preexisting and transplant-induced autospecific and allospecific immune responses (9), a nonspecific response, predominantly mediated by innate inflammatory processes related to mechanics and site, plays a major role in the loss of islets and islet function after transplantation in the liver (4,10–13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As reported by many studies, an estimated 60–80% of the transplanted islet mass is lost within hours or days after intrahepatic islet infusion (12,14,15), mainly because of immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (16), thrombosis (11,17), and hepatic tissue ischemia (18,19) with release of liver enzymes (20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, from a clinical point of view, the process of islet infusion in the liver is associated with an increase of portal pressure proportional to the islet mass (22), thus limiting the total islet mass to be transplanted (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recognizing these problems has increased the interest in the search for alternative sites for islet transplantation to avoid liver-specific problems (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite the success of experimental islet transplantation in mouse models using different sites, the results of only a few of those studies were applied in large animal models and none was applied in human models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) may be an alternative site for pancreatic islet transplantation because it offers a protected and extravascular, although well-vascularized, microenvironment (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Because of BM broad distribution and easy access, islet infusion in the BM may overcome technical limitations and reduce complications of islet infusion in the liver through the portal vein (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In a recent preclinical study, we tested whether syngeneic pancreatic islets could engraft in the BM of diabetic mice by comparing survival, function, and morphology of syngeneic islets infused in the BM or in the liver (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Islets engrafted efficiently in the BM of diabetic mice and for &gt;1 year posttransplantation, the glucose metabolism of those animals was similar to that of nondiabetic mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mice with islets infused in the BM were more likely to reach euglycemia than mice with islets infused in liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Islets in the BM showed a compact morphology with a preserved ratio between α-cells and β-cells, with only marginal effects on bone structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the presence of islets in the BM did not affect hematopoietic activity, even when this function was strongly upregulated in response to virus-induced BM aplasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we were granted approval to use this approach in humans, and we performed a pilot study in which patients with diabetes and hepatic contraindications for liver islet autotransplantation (IAT) received a single intra-BM islet infusion in the iliac crest. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, our article represents the first unequivocal example of successful engraftment of endocrine tissue in BM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our recent preclinical studies in mice (26) showed that the amount of success and the timing of reverse hyperglycemia were superior after islet infusion in the BM than in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we translated our preclinical findings to a proof-of-concept pilot phase 1 study in which four patients with pancreatogenic diabetes and hepatic contraindications for receiving islet transplant in the liver received a single intra-BM islet infusion at the iliac crest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This study has limitations, intrinsic to all phase 1 studies, such as the limited number of patients enrolled, the nonrandomized design, and the absence of a control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because of the heterogeneity of the pancreatic disease of the patients enrolled in the study, the results cannot be directly compared with those observed with autologous islets transplanted to the liver. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Although conducted with a small number of patients, this pilot experience has generated some important data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>First, we were able to document the feasibility and the safety of this approach for islet infusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The direct islet infusion in the BM was performed according to the same procedure used in our institution for the administration of cord blood cells in patients with acute leukemia (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The procedure was easy and reproducible and, thus far, we have recorded no AEs related to the islet infusion in the iliac crest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Islets in the BM did not affect hematopoietic activity, even when it was strongly upregulated in response to adjuvant chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Moreover, bone structure and trabecular compartments were not significantly affected by the presence of the infused islets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Second, and equally important, we demonstrated the presence of insulin-producing cells in BM biopsy specimens, and this presence was associated with detectable levels of fasting and stimulated circulating C-peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This implies that the BM microenvironment is able to support islet revascularization and function, providing an appropriate oxygen tension, a suitable pH, clearance of toxic metabolites, and access to nutrients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our study unequivocally proves that islets can successfully engraft in the BM, and it provides the rationale for testing the BM as a site for islet infusion in patients with T1D selected to receive allotransplantation of pancreatic islets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>A phase 2 trial in which patients with T1D will be randomized to receive islets either in the liver or in the BM is currently ongoing at our institution (NCT01722682). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>This trial will allow us to assess whether islet infusion in the BM may improve the outcome of an islet transplant infused in the liver, as measured by glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Third, we have shown that islet sampling in the BM is highly feasible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Because BM is an easily accessed and well-confined site ideal for serial multiple biopsies, we have the unique opportunity to monitor, over time, different markers of engraftment or survival of islets directly at the site of islet infusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Although sequential biopsies are often used to monitor acute or chronic events in solid organ transplants, no study in humans has ever attempted to harvest liver biopsy samples and monitor the fate of islets infused via the portal vein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This is because islets are rapidly and randomly scattered throughout the liver after intraportal infusion, and subsequent liver needle biopsies would have limited value because of the low yield of islets in biopsy samples (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In contrast, this study has shown that islet sampling in BM is feasible and allows the histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the transplanted tissue and surrounding BM and the real-time quantitative PCR analyses of messenger RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis allowed us to detect the presence of endocrine-specific proteins with higher sensitivity than with immunohistochemical analysis, and to search for the expression of transcription factors of pancreas development (33) that may be markers of the proliferation of pancreatic precursor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Notably, this monitoring strategy has the potential not only to help our mechanistic understanding of the various harmful events affecting islet graft survival but also to allow the identification of biomarkers for the prompt treatment of such events, hopefully leading to improved islet survival and prolonged insulin-independence of transplant recipients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Advances in islet transplantation research have led to remarkable improvements in clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>During the 2007–2010 period, the reported insulin independence rates were 66% at 1 year, 55% at 2 years, and 44% at 3 years (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>To achieve these results we still need to infuse a large number of islets because almost half of the islets infused in the liver die during or soon after transplantation (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Since the first report of successful pancreatic islet transplantation to reverse hyperglycemia in diabetic rodents, there has been great interest in identifying the optimal site for implantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The liver was suggested by Lacy and colleagues (34) based on their experience with a rat model of diabetes, and the first case of insulin independence in a patient with T1D after infusion of islets through the portal vein consecrated the liver as the site of choice for islet transplantation in humans (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Although the liver remains the most frequently used site, several alternative sites for islet transplantation (pancreas, gastric submucosa, genitourinary tract, muscle, omentum, kidney capsule, anterior eye chamber, testis, and thymus) have been explored in experimental animal models with the goal of improving engraftment and minimizing surgical complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The results of a few of these studies were translated in large animal models and only rarely in human models (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>However, at this time the ideal site for islet implantation has not yet been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The BM has the potential for being an alternative site for islet transplantation because of its protected and extravascular, although well-vascularized, microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>If the results of this pilot study are confirmed by randomized clinical trials, then islet infusion in BM may become an ambulatory procedure of limited invasiveness, well-suited for repeated infusions, with the possibility of performing repeated graft biopsies with a low-risk and simple procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BM also may be an appropriate site to test, in future trials, the impact of coinjecting islets with cells of putative immunomodulatory capacity, such as T-regulatory cells (37) or mesenchymal stem cells (38), that could help prevent or minimize detrimental autoimmune and alloimmune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>T-regulatory cells or mesenchymal stem cells would benefit from the close proximity of islet antigens, the target of their tolerogenic function, and from the favorable microenvironment of the BM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that pancreatic islets can efficiently engraft in BM holds the potential to revolutionize the field of islet transplantation, thus allowing new lines of research with significant clinical impact on the treatment of diabetes and, more generally, on cell therapy. </plain></SENT>
