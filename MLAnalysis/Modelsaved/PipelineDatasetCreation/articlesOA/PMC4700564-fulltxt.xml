The species <italic>X. translucens</italic> represents a complex of strains that are pathogenic on various members of the <italic>Poaceae</italic>, including wheat, barley, oat, rye and other grass species. Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and black chaff symptoms in the grain spikes on wheat are caused by <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strains. Outbreaks of BLS occur sporadically in central Great Plains and are associated with relatively warm and humid conditions, although the disease has been prevalent in recent recurrent years in the northern Great Plains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains have been classified by pathogenicity types and DNA fingerprinting technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Strains causing disease symptoms on barley and wheat are named as <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic>, while strains only pathogenic on barley are called <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>translucens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although some strains of <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic> behave similarly as <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> in pathogenicity types, they are distinguishable by DNA fingerprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Phylogenic analyses of various <italic>X. translucens</italic>, do not align with the pathovar designations, and clarifications await genomic analyses on larger strain collections. In addition, many strains that were isolated from other species, often have been reported to cause disease symptoms on wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, thirty-three bacterial strains isolated from diseased ornamental asparagus were identified as <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> using DNA fingerprinting and cross inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Next-generation sequencing technologies have made transformational changes over the Sanger sequencing by improving throughput and reducing cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The draft genome sequences provide valuable information on major genome contents and enable genome comparison among strains of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Currently, draft genome sequences are available for four strains from the <italic>X. translucens</italic> group. Draft genomic data for <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strain DAR61454, <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>transluencs</italic> strain DSM18974, <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic> CFBP2541, and <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>graminis</italic> ART-Xtg29 were generated by using Illumina or Roche 454 short read sequencing platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At the same time, genome assemblies based on Illumina and Roche 454 sequencing are fragmented, and most assemblies failed to assemble complex repetitive sequences, including Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effector genes, which occur in multiple gene copies and contain multiple simple near-perfect repeats within each gene. TAL effector genes typically have highly conserved N- and C-terminal sequences, and harbor 12.5&#8211;28.5 units of 102 or 105&#160;bp repeats in the central regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recently, a single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology was developed by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and produces long sequence reads with no obvious sequencing biases and may allow better resolution of long repetitive DNA features in a genome. Due to a high error rate of PacBio reads, a high sequencing depth (e.g., 50&#215; or higher) is usually required for a high-quality <italic>de novo</italic> assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the complete genome sequence of <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strain XT4699 was generated by using high-depth PacBio and Illumina data. The genome was compared to draft genomic sequences of nineteen additional <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains that were derived by Illumina. Comparisons of TAL effectors from three <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains and their relationship with TAL effectors from other <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> species were also performed, and evidence for TAL effector-dependent effects on host gene expression was assessed by microarray and qRT-PCR analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Complete genome assembly of XT4699</title><p>Illumina 2x250 bp MiSeq data for XT4699 provided approximately 60x coverage, comprising 267.5 Mbp total sequencing bases. The assembly <italic>via</italic> SOAPdenov2 resulted in 547 contigs of at least 400&#160;bp in length. The total assembly length was 4.4&#160;Mb and the N50 equals to 15,114&#160;bp. Two PacBio SMRT cells of 10-kb library preparation for XT4699 generated 114,394 raw reads and a total of 446&#160;Mb. The average length of reads was 3,898&#160;bp. The reads were assembled into two long contigs using an optimized assembly pipeline, HGAP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The longest contig is 4,357,621&#160;bp in length. Two contigs were merged into a single contig <italic>via</italic> combining with Illumina assembled contigs using the minimus2 module in AMOS (sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos). Alignments of PacBio raw reads to the resulting single contig identified multiple PacBio reads spanning the junction of two original Pacbio contigs, providing additional evidence for the contig merging. Two ends of the resulting single contig shared 8,439&#160;bp with 99.33&#160;% identity. The contig was circularized after removing the sharing sequence at one end. The circularized assembly draft was subjected to an additional two rounds of error correction using the PacBio resequencing pipeline that includes the error correction module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Consequently, a single finished genome sequence (<italic>N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4,561,137&#160;bp) was obtained (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Circular representation of <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strain XT4699 genome.

Respectively, 99.99 and 99.44&#160;% of the assembled genome was covered by mapping reads and uniquely mapped reads. Based on the alignments, no mismatches were identified between reads and the assembled genome (see <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), indicating the high quality of the assembly sequence. The Illumina-only assembly contigs were also aligned <italic>via</italic> nucmer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to the final assembly, and approximately 97&#160;% of the final assembly was covered by the Illumina contigs. Of the 547 contigs, 98.54&#160;% (539/547), accounting for 99.77&#160;% total contig sequence, can be aligned to the sequence with four exceptions (see <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Four single nucleotide variants, including two substitutions and two INDELs (insertion-and-deletions), were identified between the Illumina assembly contigs and the final assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). To assess the quality of the assembly in the repetitive regions, the eight TAL effector genes were cloned by high fidelity PCR and sequenced using the standard Sanger protocol. All the Sanger sequences were perfectly matched to the assembled genome sequence with 100&#160;% identity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>XT4699 genome content</title><p>The XT4699 genome is a single circular chromosome (4,561,137&#160;bp) with an overall G&#8201;+&#8201;C content of 68.1&#160;%. The complete genome, as annotated by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP), contains 3,528 coding DNA sequence (CDS) genes, 94 pseudogenes, and 54 genes with frameshift mutation that alters open reading frame. XT4699 has 2 ribosomal RNA operons and 54 tRNA genes. The genome contains 74 predicted insertion sequence (IS) elements and 56 partial IS elements using the ISfinder program (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The genome encodes three long non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS) proteins of 4827, 7451, and 6419 amino acids, respectively, in a cluster of 80&#160;kb regions flanked by IS elements (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A plant inducible promoter (PIP) element is present in 49 genes, including some type III secretion system (Hrp) and effector genes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genome features of <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strain XT4699</p></caption></table-wrap></p><p>The XT4699 genome consists of 4.3&#160;%, or approximately 0.2&#160;Mb, of repetitive sequence. Among 252 genomic repetitive regions, 163 repeats are less than 1&#160;kb and 89 repeats are longer than 1&#160;kb. The longest repeats, located around FD63_00725 and FD63_01915 ribosome RNA genes, are approximately 6&#160;kb with the 99.98&#160;% identity between two copies. Eleven pairs of tandem repeats were identified, ranging in size from 107 to 537&#160;bp. In terms of copy number, 42.5 of the repeats have two copies and 57.5&#160;% repeats have three or more copies. Tandem repeats and high copy repeats (&gt;2) increase the complexity of the assembly. In the Illumina-based assembly, more than 90&#160;% of the tandem repeats occurred at assembly gaps, even when relatively short (115&#8211;375&#160;bp), and the vast majority of high-copy repeats were not resolved. With one exception, repetitive regions with length greater than 500&#160;bp were not resolved in the Illumina-based assembly. Overall, 40&#160;% of the gaps in the Illumina-only assembly were located at repetitive regions.</p><p>The overall GC percentage of the XT4699 final assembly is 68.1&#160;%, while the overall GC percentage of the Illumina-only assembly is 67.2&#160;%, indicating GC-rich regions are not equally represented in the Illumina-based assembly. To assess Illumina and PacBio sequence results for GC-rich regions, the final assembly genome was scanned with non-overlapping 200&#160;bp windows, and the GC% and sequencing coverage of both Illumina and PacBio sequences were determined at each window. Scatter plots showed a GC bias in sequencing coverage of Illumina but not PacBio, which at least partially explains high variation of Illumina sequencing coverage and uniform distribution of PacBio sequencing reads across the genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1). The vast majority (50/55) of extremely high GC regions, which exhibit&#8201;&gt;&#8201;80&#160;% GC content, overlap with assembly gaps in the Illumina-only assembly. Most gaps on GC rich regions are very small (&lt;100&#160;bp). The flanking contigs of many of these gaps have overlaps, but the overlapping sequences between two adjacent contigs are not long enough to join them. On the contrary, gaps caused by repeats are generally longer than GC-rich gaps. The sizes of repeat-induced gaps are linearly correlated with repeat sizes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2). Regardless of gaps in the Illumina-only assembly, the contig sequences exhibit high accuracy when compared with the final assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Phylogenetic relationship and pathogenicity types of <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains</title><p>Genome assembly using Illumina 2x250 bp reads for other 19 <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains was performed with contigs having 70&#8211;200x coverage.

The advances of genome sequencing technologies and better assembly algorithms now facilitate assembly of genomes with highly repetitive regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, a complete genome sequence was generated for <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strain XT4699. The results demonstrated that PacBio data was sufficient to achieve a high-accuracy assembly of a bacterial genome with many IS elements and multiple copies of highly repetitive TAL effector genes. Intact sequences of TAL effector genes can be used to predict the potential targets in host genomes, thereby facilitating the identification of possible resistant or susceptible genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Draft genome sequence data was also generated using Illumina short reads for 20 strains, including XT4699, to determine the relatedness and compare effector contents among them. The comparison between the XT4699 Illumina-only assembly and the complete XT4699 assembly shows that approximately 97&#160;% the complete genome is covered by the Illumina-only assembled contigs. The characterization of assembly gaps on the Illumina-only assembly indicates that gaps are largely located at repetitive regions and high GC contents. The lengths of gaps at repetitive regions tend to be linearly correlated to repeat lengths while the gaps at high GC regions are typically small. Gaps due to a high GC content may, in the future, be reduced by using a new Illumina PCR-free library preparation protocol, which is expected to ameliorate amplification biases associated with high GC contents. TAL effector gene content was not resolved in the Illumina draft genome sequences. To resolve repeats, especially long and complex repeats, PacBio or other emerging long read sequencing technologies are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The improvement of these long read sequencing technologies may dramatically reduce the sequencing cost per bacterial strain in the near future. The ability to sequence and completely assemble a large number of independent strains would greatly accelerate genome comparison and the identification of bacterial virulence factors. Although not examined here, PacBio sequence can also be used to characterize the methylomes of bacteria and enables the exploration of possible epigenetic features in bacterial gene expression and restriction modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The comparison of type III effector (T3E) content in <italic>X. tranlucens</italic> strains identified both conservative (<italic>N</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;23) and variable T3Es among three pathvors, <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa, X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>translucens</italic> and <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic>. Effector triggered immunity (ETI) is defined by T3S/R gene pairs, which are present in the pathogens and host plants, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Highly conserved sets of T3Es provide a potential opportunity to deploy pyramided R genes for broad resistance to the bacterial leaf streak disease, although no T3Es-specific R genes are known in wheat at this time. Presence and absence variation, copy number variation, and frameshift mutations were all observed in T3Es among <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains, and TAL effector repertories are also highly variable. The <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic> strain CFBP2541 only contains two TAL effectors, sharing no similarity with TAL effectors from <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strains based on the RVD sequences. Variation in T3Es may be one factor accounting for pathogenic diversity and host range determinants of <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains. Pathogenic and genetic diversity are present in <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains collected from five different locations in North Dakota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and host specific virulence genes have been reported to act as host range determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. CFBP2541 (<italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic>) is a phylogenetically close strain to XT123 (<italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>cerealis</italic>) and was reported to cause severe symptoms on &#8216;Morex&#8217; barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. XT123 only induced chlorosis on &#8216;Morex&#8217; barley. However, pathogenicity diversity among different <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains may also be derived from variation in other genetic elements related with bacterial fitness. Functional mutation and complementation in genes related with virulence is needed for detecting the virulence contribution of genes and explaining their roles leading to difference in pathogenicity types.</p><p>The TAL effector triggered susceptibility has been demonstrated in several disease complexes. The TAL effectors are a large family of closely related type III effector proteins, which transcriptionally activate host gene expression by directly interacting with promoter elements of host genes and have a varying degree of contribution in bacterial virulence, proliferation, and other disease symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. So far, TAL effectors with virulence contribution have been detected in strains of <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic>, <italic>X. citri</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic>, <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>vesicatoria</italic>, <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>malvacearum</italic>, <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>manihotis</italic> and <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzicola</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, it is still an open question whether TAL effectors play roles in triggering susceptibility in bacterial leaf streak on wheat. In this study, we are confirmed that TAL effectors do modulate transcriptional profiling of wheat host. The XT4699-Tal6 effector affects the transcriptional level of two candidate target genes, encoding a bHLH transcriptional factor and a succinate dehydrogenase subunit, respectively. Whether or not they are directly targeted by Tal6 is unknown. Searching in the promoter regions of the two genes using the RVD sequence of Tal6 did not give positive EBE above the default cutoff value (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/node/add/talef-off">https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/node/add/talef-off</ext-link>). We also failed to detect the direct interaction between Tal6 and 400&#160;bp promoter sequence upstream of translation start site of bHLH gene in the assays of <italic>Agrobacteria</italic>-mediated transient expression in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> KY-14 (data not shown). In this study, no <italic>tal</italic> mutants suffered an obvious loss of virulence when compared to the WT strain in the bacterial growth population assays (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S6). It is not known if TAL effectors contribute to bacterial virulence in other ways. Previous studies showed AvrBs3 of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>vesicatoria</italic>, Tal2g of <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzicola</italic> and Avrb6 from <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>malvacearum</italic> did not affect bacterial growth but had roles in other types of virulence contributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>In this study, XT4699-<italic>tal7</italic> was identified as a conserved TAL effector gene among 8 of 12 <italic>X. translucens</italic> pv. <italic>undulosa</italic> strains. Cloning and sequencing of TAL effector genes in larger collection of <italic>X. translucens</italic> strains is needed to get more reliable information regarding with conservation of TAL effector genes. The insertion of DNA elements, specifically designed to be recognized by RVDs of conserved TAL effectors, in the promoter regions of effective R genes was applied for controlling bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].
