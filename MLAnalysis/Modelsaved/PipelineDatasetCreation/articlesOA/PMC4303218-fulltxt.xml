GALT deficiency results in the genetic disorder classic galactosemia, whose pathophysiology is still not fully elucidated. Whereas classic galactosemia has been hypothesized to result from GALT misfolding, a thorough functional&#8211;structural characterization of GALT most prevalent variants was still lacking, hampering the development of alternative therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to investigate the structural&#8211;functional effects of nine <italic>GALT</italic> mutations, four of which account for the vast majority of the mutations identified in galactosemic patients. Several methodologies were employed to evaluate the mutations' impact on GALT function, on the protein secondary and tertiary structures, and on the aggregation propensity. The major structural effect concerns disturbed propensity for aggregation, particularly striking for the p.Q188R variant, resulting from the most frequent (&#8764;60%) allele at a worldwide scale. The absence of major effects at the secondary and tertiary structure levels suggests that the disturbed aggregation results from subtle perturbations causing a higher and/or longer exposure of hydrophobic residues in the variants as compared to WT GALT. The results herein described indicate a possible benefit from introducing proteostasis regulators and/or chemical/pharmacological chaperones to prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates, in new avenues of therapeutic research for classic galactosemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chemical/pharmacological chaperones</kwd><kwd>classic galactosemia</kwd><kwd>GALT</kwd><kwd>misfolding</kwd><kwd>missense mutations</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>proteostasis regulators.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Classic galactosemia (OMIM #230400) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>GALT</italic> gene, resulting in deficient activity of galactose-<sc>1</sc>-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT, EC 2.7.7.12), a key enzyme in galactose metabolism (Fridovich-Keil and Walter <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). GALT catalyzes the second step of the Leloir pathway, converting galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose (UDP-Glc) into glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) (Fridovich-Keil and Walter <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>In classic galactosemia, acute symptoms generally appear soon after birth upon exposure to milk, and include the following: vomiting, diarrhea, excessive weight loss, lethargy, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, and, in the absence of intervention, can escalate to cataracts, <italic>Escherichia</italic> (<italic>E</italic>.) <italic>coli</italic> sepsis, and eventually to neonatal death (Holton et&#160;al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Bosch <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Suchy et&#160;al. <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Fridovich-Keil and Walter <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These symptoms generally self-resolve once the patient is placed on a stringent lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, which is the current standard of care (Fridovich-Keil <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, despite resolving the acute and potentially lethal symptoms, the dietetic treatment does not prevent the development of serious long-term complications, namely cognitive and neurologic disabilities, and premature ovarian insufficiency in females (Waggoner et&#160;al. <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Fridovich-Keil and Walter <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, 266 variations have been described at the <italic>GALT locus</italic> (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/GALT/GALT_display.php">http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/GALT/GALT_display.php</ext-link>, last surveyed on December 2013), of which missense mutations constitute the majority (&gt;60%), despite the high allelic heterogeneity (Calderon et&#160;al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In particular, the c.563A&gt;G transition, originating the p.Q188R variant, is by far the most frequent, accounting for &#8764;63% of <italic>GALT</italic> mutant alleles (Elsas et&#160;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Tyfield et&#160;al. <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Its incidence is particularly high in European descendant patients, reaching &gt;90% of mutant alleles in Ireland; it has, however, never been reported in Asian descendant patients (Hirokawa et&#160;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Fridovich-Keil and Walter <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Coss et&#160;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Other frequent mutations originate the p.S135L, p.K285N, and, p.N314D variants. The c.404 C&gt;T mutation (p.S135L) affects mostly African descendant patients, ranging from approximately half of mutant alleles in African Americans to &#8764;90% in South African patients (Elsas et&#160;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Tyfield et&#160;al. <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The second most frequent <italic>GALT</italic> mutant allele in European descendant patients is c.855G&gt;T (p.K285N), with a higher incidence in Eastern Europe, reaching 34% in Poland (Elsas et&#160;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Tyfield et&#160;al. <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Zekanowski et&#160;al. <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Suzuki et&#160;al. <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The c.940A&gt;G mutation (p.N314D) appears to be an evolutionary remnant, as the D314 is actually the ancestral variant that persists nowadays at a pan-ethnic frequency of nearly 10% (Suzuki et&#160;al. <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Carney et&#160;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This missense variation is associated with two variant forms depending on the presence of additional base changes: the Los Angeles variant, which carries p.N314D in <italic>linkage disequilibrium</italic> with p.L218L (c.652C&gt;T; CTA&#8594;TTA) (Langley et&#160;al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>); and the Duarte variant, which carries p.N314D in <italic>linkage disequilibrium</italic> with three intronic variations (c.378-27G&gt;C, c.507+62G&gt;A, c.508-24G&gt;A), and a deletion in the <italic>GALT</italic> promoter (c.-119_-116delGTCA) (Elsas et&#160;al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Trbusek et&#160;al. <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Carney et&#160;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Functional studies revealed that the translation favorable codon TTA from p.L218L (Langley et&#160;al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and the promoter deletion (Trbusek et&#160;al. <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) are respectively responsible for the altered activities of the Los Angeles and Duarte variants, and that the p.N314D variation is actually not a disease-causing mutation and is better considered a polymorphism.</p><p>Notwithstanding the several studies on the molecular basis of these mutations' pathogenicity (Reichardt et&#160;al. <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Fridovich-Keil and Jinks-Robertson <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Fridovich-Keil et&#160;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1995a</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Lai et&#160;al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Langley et&#160;al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Wells and Fridovich-Keil <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Lai and Elsas <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Riehman et&#160;al. <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Chhay et&#160;al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), a characterization of these variants focusing on different structural features is still missing. To date, there is no solved three-dimensional structure of the human GALT. However, based on the availability of the <italic>E. coli</italic> GalT structure (Wedekind et&#160;al. <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and on the high sequence identity and similarity between the human and the prokaryotic GALT, a three-dimensional model of the human GALT was herein generated (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A and B), as previously reported (Marabotti and Facchiano <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), which provided important insights into the structural and functional features of this protein. GALT is a member of the transferase branch of the histidine triad (HIT) family of enzymes; the catalytic site sequence His-Pro-His is conserved in nature, and was firstly identified in the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme at residues 164&#8211;166, corresponding to residues 184&#8211;186 in the human sequence (Wedekind et&#160;al. <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Brenner <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Leslie <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Marabotti and Facchiano <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The reaction displays ping-pong kinetics and a double displacement mechanism, involving an uridylyl-enzyme, in which the nucleophilic histidine at residue 186 is transiently nucleotidylated (Wong and Frey <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>; Field et&#160;al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Wedekind et&#160;al. <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The active enzyme is an 86.6-kDa homodimer (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A), with two active sites, each formed by residues contributed by both subunits (Thoden et&#160;al. <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Whereas the <italic>E. coli</italic> GalT has two mononuclear metal-binding sites (one for zinc and the other for iron) with proposed structural roles, the human GALT lacks two of the zinc ligands, thus it remains to be established whether metal binding in the human protein is comparable to that of the bacterial GalT (Geeganage and Frey <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural models of GALT dimer.

However, little is known about the conformational impact of the most prevalent mutations, which hampers the design of alternative therapies for this monogenic disorder based on the use of stabilizing low-molecular-weight compounds (Leandro and Gomes <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Accordingly, the aim of this study was to further investigate the structural&#8211;functional effects of the most prevalent mutations in the <italic>GALT</italic> gene, originating the p.Q188R, p.S135L, p.K285N, and p.N314D variants, and of five other clinically relevant mutations (variants p.R148Q, p.G175D, p.P185S, p.R231C, and p.R231H).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Production of recombinant human GALT variants</title><p>Recombinant human GALT was produced by cloning the human <italic>GALT</italic> cDNA (GenBank ID M60091.1; a kind gift of Prof. Judith Fridovich-Keil, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) into the HindIII and SalI restriction sites of pET24b(+), the T7 tag being deleted using the NdeI and EcoRI enzymes. Four CAT and two CAC codons were then inserted to introduce an N-terminal hexa-histidyl tag, by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange&#174; II XL Mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the primers 6His-F (CCAGCGGATCCCCCTCAAAAATGCATCATCACCATCACCACATGTCGCGCAGTGGAACCGATC) and 6His-R (GATCGGTTCCAC TGCGCGACATGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGCATTTTTGAGGGGGATCCGCTGG). All changes were confirmed by sequencing in both orientations. Site-directed mutagenesis with the NZY mutagenesis kit (NZYTech, Lisbon, Portugal) was employed to introduce all the mutations herein under study using the primers listed in Table S1.

Whereas p.N314D had the same specific activity as WT GALT, the other variants displayed &#8804;0.2% of residual activity.

Whereas most variants exhibited a &#8220;ground-state&#8221; fluorescence similar to WT GALT, a &gt;30% increase was observed for p.Q188R (Fig. S1), indicating that the p.Q188R native conformation displays a higher and/or more prolonged exposure of hydrophobic residues. DSF thermal denaturation curves showed two transitions (Fig. S2), suggestive of two protein regions unfolding as separate domains, contrarily to the previously reported single transition for different GALT variants (McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Both <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values determined for the WT GALT (43.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7&#176;C and 52.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#176;C) are lower than the previously reported <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (63&#176;C) (McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which could be partially explained by different experimental conditions, particularly a pH closer to physiologic in our assays (7.5 vs. 8.8 reported in (McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)), besides the protein concentrations and the temperature slope (McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

We observed no effect of either substrate on the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values for WT GALT and the studied variants, whereas McCorvie et&#160;al. previously reported a stabilizing effect of both substrates for WT GALT and the p.D28Y and p.F194L variants (McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Notably, the structures of the <italic>E. coli</italic> GalT in the native and nucleotylated states (PDB ID 1HXP and 1HXQ) are totally overlapping (Wedekind et&#160;al. <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>, <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), ruling out major conformational changes upon substrate binding.</p><p>Zinc and iron were shown to have a structural role in bacterial GalT (Ruzicka et&#160;al. <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). While the iron-binding ligands are fully conserved in human GALT, the zinc ligands are partially conserved, raising the question whether this metal is essential (Wells and Fridovich-Keil <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). While iron had no effect on the WT GALT stability in the DSF assays, zinc had the puzzling effect of destabilizing the protein, lowering both <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values by &#8764;4&#176;C (Table S2). As the zinc binding pocket is not fully conserved, our results suggest that zinc may occupy the mononuclear iron-binding site, proposed to be unable to completely discriminate between iron and zinc (Geeganage and Frey <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Holden et&#160;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Zinc may also bind to the exposed N-terminal 6-His tag and partially affect protein stability (Evers et&#160;al. <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Iron had no significant effects on any variant except for a slight increase in the <italic>T</italic><sub>m1</sub> of p.P185S, located far from the iron-binding site, suggesting that local perturbations propagate to distal sites in the protein structure. Zinc, however, resulted in all variants behaving essentially as the WT GALT (Table S2) except p.Q188R, which appeared insensitive to zinc. The replaced serine in p.S135L structurally overlaps with the zinc-binding ligand H115 in <italic>E. coli</italic> GalT. The fact that this variant displays the same zinc sensitivity as WT GALT reinforces the idea that the observed zinc-induced destabilization might be related to non-specific occupation of the iron-binding site. Although the effect of zinc cannot as yet be rationalized in functional terms, the different impacts on the conformational stability suggest subtle structural differences between these variants.</p><p>As aggregation in solution is a hallmark of protein misfolding, DLS was used to compare the proneness of the GALT variants to aggregate, evaluating the <italic>T</italic><sub>agg</sub> and the aggregation kinetics at 37&#176;C and upon a thermal insult at 42&#176;C (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> and Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Regarding the thermal aggregation profiles, all variants but p.Q188R exhibited <italic>T</italic><sub>agg</sub> values nearly identical to the WT GALT. p.Q188R displayed a disturbed thermal aggregation profile, with a <italic>T</italic><sub>agg</sub> &#8764;4&#176;C lower than WT, indicating a higher propensity to aggregate in solution. Recalling the &#8764;30% higher ground-state fluorescence of this variant as compared to WT GALT, we hypothesize that a higher and/or longer exposure of hydrophobic residues may be directing its increased tendency to aggregate. The aggregation kinetics at two different temperatures also highlighted the disturbed aggregation behavior of other variants. At 37&#176;C, the p.G175D and p.P185S variants also aggregate significantly faster than WT GALT, whereas p.S135L, p.N314D and p.R231C displayed slower aggregation kinetics. Upon thermal insult at 42&#176;C, some of the effects observed at 37&#176;C were enhanced, others leveled out, and new effects were observed. Besides p.Q188R, p.G175D and p.P185S, also p.R148Q and p.R231H aggregate faster than WT GALT at 42&#176;C, indicating that the latter two variants are less resistant to aggregation under this thermal insult. All the variants that presented slower aggregation at 37&#176;C were leveled to the WT aggregation kinetics at 42&#176;C. p.K285N was the only variant showing aggregation parameters essentially identical to the WT GALT in both conditions.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Dynamic light scattering analysis of GALT variants reveals disturbed aggregation.

The p.Q188R model (Figs.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C and S4) suggests an actual gain in H-bonds, since the guanidinium moiety may establish three &#8220;new&#8221; H-bonds towards the intermediate phosphate and sugar moieties. This variant's functional impairment could therefore result from over-stabilization of the substrates and/or products blocking the enzyme active site for further reaction turnover. Such a disturbed intermediate stabilization had already been proposed by Marabotti and Facchiano (<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), who remarked that this analysis is highly dependent on the accuracy of the predicted location of the R188 side-chain, observed to adopt different geometries among different models (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C). In addition to the local H-bond network differences, we observed a significant change in the electrostatic surface surrounding this position (Fig. S4), consistent with the substitution of a globally neutral amide with the positively charged guanidinium of arginine, which may also affect binding of mostly negatively charged reaction substrates and products. It remains to be clarified how this substitution renders this variant insensitive to zinc-induced destabilization. Taken together, these observations demonstrate how local subtle changes can propagate into other regions of the protein with dramatic global effects.</p><p>Besides local changes in the H-bonds and electrostatic interactions resulting from the studied mutations, most studied variants that presented disturbed aggregation kinetics also displayed predicted effects on their surface electrostatic charges, either inverting the polarity of the local charges, or neutralizing them (Figs. S4&#8211;S12). Although this is not a necessary condition to alter the aggregation propensity, it may contribute to stabilize non-native conformations with downstream effects on protein aggregation. Moreover, taking into account the proposal that GALT may assemble with GALE and GALK a supra-molecular structure localized to discrete spots in the cell (Christacos et&#160;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; McCorvie and Timson <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), surface charge perturbations could hamper the formation of such complexes. Since the structural and molecular modeling studies do not unequivocally explain the disturbed aggregation profiles, it is likely that the subtle structural changes resulting from each mutation have an impact on the protein dynamics, extending the lifetime of conformations with a higher exposure of hydrophobic residues, that could act as nuclei triggering aggregation of the misfolded variants (e.g., Saunders and Bottomley <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kubota et&#160;al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have aimed to analyze the functional impairment of the most prevalent mutations in classic galactosemia. A recent report suggests protein misfolding as the pathogenic mechanism of several <italic>GALT</italic> missense mutations, as commonly observed for genetic diseases (Gregersen et&#160;al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; McCorvie et&#160;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In our functional and structural impact studies on the most frequent variations in classic galactosemia (p.Q188R, p.S135L, p.K285N, and p.N314D) accounting for the vast majority of mutant alleles at a global scale, the most striking and novel observation is that most variants display disturbed aggregation profiles, despite the absence of detectable structural effects on their secondary and tertiary structures. This is particularly relevant for p.Q188R, resulting from the most prevalent mutation, accounting for &#8764;60% of the mutant alleles. This observation is extremely important, since at the cellular level, the accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins interferes severely with the cellular homeostasis. Fibroblasts from p.Q188R homozygous patients displayed increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (Slepak et&#160;al. <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Moreover, studies on GALT-null galactosemia models revealed increased unfolded protein response (De-Souza et&#160;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and oxidative stress levels (Jumbo-Lucioni et&#160;al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), also suggesting that there is a basal level of protein homeostasis disturbance associated with galactosemia. There is an increasing awareness that accumulation of damaged or abnormal proteins is the underlying pathogenic molecular mechanism of several diseases, and several studies on inborn errors of metabolism revealed protein aggregation as a more common pathogenic mechanism than previously thought (Pedersen et&#160;al. <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). A relevant example concerns the in vivo GALE aggregation in type III galactosemia (Bang et&#160;al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Accordingly, the results from the structural analyses of the GALT mutants herein characterized strongly suggest that GALT aggregation associated with protein misfolding might be a major pathogenic mechanism in classic galactosemia, setting the basis for future studies on in vivo GALT aggregation. Therefore, an intervention at the level of proteostasis modulation and correction of protein misfolding (by chemical and/or pharmacological chaperones) could not only increase the lifetime of partially active variants, but also prevent the accumulation of protein aggregates and simultaneously alleviate the disease phenotype associated with protein homeostasis disturbances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Funda&#231;&#227;o para a Ci&#234;ncia e Tecnologia PTDC/QUI-BIQ/111080/2009 Grant to J.
