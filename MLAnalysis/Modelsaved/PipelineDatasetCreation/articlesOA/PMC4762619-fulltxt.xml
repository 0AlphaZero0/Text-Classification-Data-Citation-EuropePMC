By integrating our proteomics data with recently available transcriptomic data sets we have detailed the pathways involved with EV biogenesis in <italic>F. hepatica</italic> and propose that the small exosome biogenesis occurs via ESCRT-dependent MVB formation in the tegumental syncytium before being shed from the apical plasma membrane. Furthermore, we found that the molecular &#8220;machinery&#8221; required for EV biogenesis is constitutively expressed across the intramammalian development stages of the parasite.

Fasciolosis is also an important zoonotic disease with an estimated 2.6 million people infected worldwide; human infection is particularly highly prevalent in Egypt and the Andes of South America, while outbreaks regularly occur in Northern Iran (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Infection in animals and humans can last many years while adult parasites reside in the bile ducts. <italic>F. hepatica</italic> are obligate blood feeders and obtain blood by puncturing the bile duct wall. The regular regurgitation of parasite gut contents is thought to inject molecules into the bloodstream where they can exert an immunosuppressive activity on the host immune system (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Other molecules are secreted from the gut, excretory pores and surface tegument into the bile where they may be carried to the exterior via the host intestine (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We, and others, have previously used proteomic techniques to profile the secretome of adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) but these studies had a number of limitations: (1) they relied on very limited transcriptome data sets with considerable redundancy; (2) because genome sequence data was lacking it was not possible to determine precisely the identity and/or the number of the genes contributing to various secreted protein families; (3) the contribution of extracellular vesicles to fluke secretions was not investigated. However, our recent report of the <italic>Fasciola</italic> genome and associated transcriptome data sets (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) has now allowed us to address these limitations and perform a definitive characterization of the total secretome of adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic>. This is timely, given the report of exosome-like EVs released by adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> are small membrane bound organelles that are shed by most cell types. Although once considered to be &#8220;cellular garbage cans&#8221; with the sole purpose of discarding unwanted cellular material (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), EVs are now recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication by transferring molecular signals, including proteins, lipids, mRNA, microRNA and other non-coding RNA species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Variously described as exosomes or microvesicles depending on their cellular origin and mode of biogenesis, EVs perform a variety of roles in the maintenance of normal physiology such as blood coagulation, immune regulation and tissue repair (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but also participate in pathological settings, notably in tumor progression (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A number of recent studies have shown that parasite-derived EVs play an important role during infection. For instance, EVs released by the helminth parasites <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> are capable of modulating the response of host innate immune cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the deep analysis of the soluble and vesicular components of the adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> secretome. We found that <italic>F. hepatica</italic> secretes at least two subpopulations of EVs that differ according to size, cargo molecules and potential site of release from the parasite. Using a proteomic approach, integrated with newly available <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome and transcriptome resources (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we have defined the protein composition of these two classes of vesicle and non-vesicle associated proteins. The larger 15K EVs are released from the specialized cells that line the parasite gastrodermus and contain, as a marker, the 37 kDa inactive zymogen of the cathepsin L1 digestive peptidase. In contrast, our analysis of the smaller 120K exosome-like vesicle population suggest that they are shed from the tegument of adult fluke. Although the 120K EV biogenesis &#8220;machinery&#8221; is constitutively expressed across the intramammalian developmental stages of the parasite, the cargo molecules packaged within the EVs are highly regulated, most likely to facilitate the parasites migration through host tissue and to counteract host immune attack.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title><p>Western blots and fluorogenic assays were performed with at least two biological replicates and three technical triplicates. For the proteomics study, whole <italic>Fasciola</italic> EVs were initially analyzed by LC-MS/MS (two technical replicates). These identifications were subsequently mapped to the surface/membrane/lumen of the EVs following analysis of the EV fractions, which were run without replicates because of the paucity of parasite material. The aim of this experiment was to profile the molecules associated with fluke EVs and no quantitation was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of Adult F. hepatica Extracellular Vesicles</title><p>Adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> parasites were obtained from bovine livers from local abattoirs. To prepare secretions, adult flukes were thoroughly washed with PBS to void their gut contents and then maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 0.1% glucose, 100 U penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), at 2 worms/ml for 5 h at 37 &#176;C. EVs were purified according to the differential centrifugation protocol described by Marcilla <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).

The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4 &#176;C to obtain large vesicles. Culture supernatants were then filtered using a 0.2 &#956;m ultrafiltration membrane, and centrifuged at 120,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic>/1 h at 4 &#176;C to recover smaller vesicles that were subsequently washed with PBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis of the EVs and Secretome</title><p>The protein content of adult fluke soluble secretions and EVs was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Loughborough, UK). Equal amounts (5 &#956;g) of each sample were run on reducing NuPage Novex 4&#8211;12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Paisley, UK) at 120 mA for 45 min. Following transfer, the membranes were incubated in blocking solution (TBST: 20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1% Tween-20, pH 7.6) containing 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature (18&#8211;21 &#176;C). Blots were probed with a 1:15,000 dilution of sheep antiserum raised against recombinant <italic>F. hepatica</italic> peroxiredoxin (FhPrx; 22) or recombinant cathepsin L1 (FhCL1; Dalton, unpublished); a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant helminth defense molecule (FhHDM-1; 23) or a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> leucine aminopeptidase which is reactive to <italic>F. hepatica</italic> leucine aminopeptidase (SmLAP; 24, Dalton unpublished) for 2 h at room temperature (18&#8211;21 &#176;C). After washing in TBST (3 &#215; 10 min), an appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody was applied to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature (18&#8211;21 &#176;C) before detection using the BCIP/NBT substrate (Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>Trypsin Shaving and Sequential Extraction of Purified F. hepatica EVs</title><p>Peptides from surface-accessible proteins were released by trypsin hydrolysis of EVs isolated from adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> using our previously described protocol (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Briefly, sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Southampton, UK) was added to purified <italic>F. hepatica</italic> EVs at a final concentration of 50 &#956;g/ml for 5 min at 37 &#176;C. The treated EVs were then centrifuged at 100,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 &#176;C, and the released peptides recovered from the supernatant.</p><p>To investigate subvesicular protein localization, purified <italic>F. hepatica</italic> EVs were sequentially extracted to identify proteins associated with the EV membrane or those contained within the EV lumen. First, the EVs were resuspended in water; the resulting osmotic shock causes the EVs to burst and release the soluble contents held within the EV lumen. The EV membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 &#176;C, while the soluble contents of the EV lumen were recovered in the supernatant. The membrane pellet was sequentially extracted with 0.1 <sc>m</sc> Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (pH 11) on ice for 30 min to extract peripheral proteins and the sample centrifuged at 100,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 &#176;C. The final pellet was then solubilized in 1% Triton X-100/2% SDS for 15 min at 37 &#176;C to produce integral membrane protein fractions (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mass Spectrometry Analysis of EV and Secretome Fractions</title><p>Proteins in the various EV fractions were reduced with 2 m<sc>m</sc> DTT in 50 m<sc>m</sc> NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (60 &#176;C/20 min) and alkylated with 5 m<sc>m</sc> iodoacetamide (room temperature (18&#8211;21 &#176;C) in the dark/30 min). Samples were then incubated with 100 ng/&#956;l sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) (37 &#176;C/overnight). The digestions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 0.1% and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The final mixtures were reconstituted with 10 &#956;l of 0.1% TFA before analysis by LC-MS/MS. Five microliters of the resulting suspension were delivered to an analytical column (Eksigen C18-CL NanoLC Column, 3 &#956;m; 75 &#956;m &#215; 15 cm) equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (FA). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 5&#8211;35% buffer B in buffer A for 30min (buffer A: 0.1% FA; buffer B: acetonitrile, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were analyzed in a nanoESI qQTOF mass spectrometer (5600 TripleTOF, ABSCIEX) operating in information-dependent acquisition mode, in which a 0.25-s TOF MS scan from 350&#8211;1250 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, was performed, followed by 0.05-s product ion scans from 100&#8211;1500 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> on the 50 most intense 2&#8211;5 charged ions.

Mascot was set up to search a database comprised of the gene models identified within the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome (version 1.0, 101,780 entries; 11) assuming trypsin digestion with 1 missed cleavage permitted. The <italic>F. hepatica</italic> gene model sequences can be accessed through WormBase ParaSite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://parasite.wormbase.org/">http://parasite.wormbase.org/</ext-link>) under accession PRJEB6687 (genomic read data and gene model transcripts). Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 0.1 Da. Iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification. Glu-&gt;pyro-Glu of the N terminus, Gln-&gt;pyro-Glu of the N terminus, deamidation of Asn and Gln and oxidation of Met were specified in Mascot as variable modifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria for Protein Identification</title><p>Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.3.0, Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) with Scaffold delta-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the F. hepatica Transcriptome and Gene Models</title><p>RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis was carried out for multiple lifecycle stages, including metacercariae, NEJ 1, 3 and 24 h postexcystment, juvenile 21-day-old and adult liver flukes, as described by Cwiklinski et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Briefly, Illumina TruSeq RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced, with the resulting RNAseq data being mapped to <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome scaffolds and gene models. Differential expression analysis in edgeR was carried out for all genes to which at least five Illumina reads across all libraries could be mapped. Discovery of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genes associated with EV machinery was carried out using BLAST analysis against the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome. Briefly, human proteins, inferred from the literature to have roles in exosome biogenesis, cargo sorting or uptake, were used as BLAST queries to identify homologs in closely-related trematode species (NCBI; trematoda). Both the human proteins and trematode homologs were used as BLAST queries to interrogate the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome (NCBI v2.2.29). Each match was manually validated and confirmed using InterPro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</ext-link>) which detects the presence of conserved protein domains. Expression of these identified genes across the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> lifecycle was investigated using the differential expression analysis of all the gene models identified within the genome. Hierarchical clustering using Gene Cluster 3.0 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) was used to group differentially expressed genes by similarity of expression, graphically represented using heat-maps.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Peptidase Activity in EVs</title><p>The soluble contents of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> EVs recovered following the 15,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> and 120,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> centrifugation of fluke culture media were isolated by osmotic shock. Briefly, the vesicle pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES-KOH; pH 7.3) and placed on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing followed by sonication (5 &#215; 20s at 20% power). The vesicle membranes were then removed by centrifugation at 20,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 &#176;C. Auto-activation of the native procathepsin L was carried out by incubating the soluble extract from the 15,000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> vesicle pellet (50 &#956;g total protein) at 37 &#176;C in 100 m<sc>m</sc> citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT. Aliquots (15 &#956;l) were removed at time intervals and added to tubes containing 1 &#956;l of 1 m<sc>m</sc> E-64 to stop the reaction. Proteolytic cleavage of the prosegment was visualized by immunoblotting as described above. Cathepsin L activity was also monitored in the presence of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-Leu-Arg-NHMec (20 &#956;<sc>m</sc>) by measuring the release of fluorescence over time using a Polarstar Omega micro-plate reader (BMG Labtech) in 96-well fluorescent plates as previously described (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Cathepsin B activity was measured by incubating the soluble vesicular extracts with Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec (10 &#956;<sc>m</sc>) in 100 m<sc>m</sc> citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT and 0.01% Triton X-100. E-64 (10 &#956;<sc>m</sc>) was used to inhibit cathepsin L and B activity. Leucine aminopeptidase activity was measured by incubating the vesicular extracts with the substrate H-Leu-NHMec (10 &#956;<sc>m</sc>) in 100 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 m<sc>m</sc> MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.01% Triton X-100.

However, when we performed the same analysis of the transcripts encoding the remaining proteins identified during our proteomics analysis of adult fluke exosome-like EVs (<italic>i.e.</italic> those not implicated in EV biogenesis and thus termed putative cargo molecules), we found that most were expressed at higher levels and were developmentally regulated.

We have discovered that adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> secretions are more complex than previously thought, and contain at least two subpopulations of EVs that differ according to size, cargo and mechanism of release from the parasite. In doing so we have challenged the classic view that soluble proteins are the sole mediators of the host-parasite interaction and identified new mechanisms by which parasite-derived molecules can interact with host cells. These mechanisms can be classed under various headings: (1) <italic>Extracellular interaction with host macromolecules</italic>. In terms of protein content, soluble molecules made the greatest contribution to the adult fluke total secretome (87.8%). This fraction is dominated by members of the cathepsin L cysteine peptidase family which represent &gt;80% of the total protein secreted (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). <italic>Fasciola</italic> cathepsin Ls perform a variety of roles, mostly associated with extracellular degradation of host macromolecules such as collagen to aid parasite migration through host tissues (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), hemoglobin as a source of nutrition (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and immunoglobulins to avoid expulsion by the host immune system (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The considerable expenditure devoted to secretion of soluble proteins by <italic>F. hepatica</italic> clearly shows that these tasks are critical for completion of the parasite's life-cycle. (2) <italic>Endocytosis of soluble parasite molecules</italic>. We have shown that cathepsin L1 and helminth defense molecule (HDM), which are both present as soluble proteins within <italic>F. hepatica</italic> secretions, are internalized via the endolysosomal pathway and modulate host macrophage function by degradation of toll-like receptor 3 and inhibition of vacuolar-ATPase respectively (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The receptors required for uptake of these molecules are currently unknown however HDM binds to cholesterol within lipid rafts on the cell surface that may initiate internalization (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). (3) <italic>Internalization of parasite EVs</italic>. Although we estimate that the 15 K and 120 K EV pellets hold only 8.6% and 3.6% of the total protein secreted by adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic>, respectively, they contain potent immunomodulators/virulence factors (see below) that would exert greater effects on host cell function than their abundance might suggest. EVs secreted by adult flukes will drain, via the bile ducts, into the host gut and we have shown that fluke exosome-like EVs are internalized by host intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although traditionally regarded as a mere physical barrier to infection, IECs are now known to express pattern-recognition receptors that enable them to detect a range of microbial ligands and transmit signals to underlying gut-associated lymphoid tissues (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Thus, parasite-derived EVs could maintain a systemic Th2/regulatory environment that is permissive to fluke survival and reproduction via modulation of IEC immune surveillance.</p><p>We, and others, have shown that several proteins released by <italic>F. hepatica</italic> have the ability to modulate host immune cell function (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In this study we have found the majority of these immunomodulators are packaged within the exosome-like EVs secreted by adult fluke. Although <italic>F. hepatica</italic> peroxiredoxin (Prx) actively drives host Th2 immune responses via stimulation of M2 macrophages (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), most of the other fluke immunomodulators identified so far (despite displaying varied structures and biochemical activities), indirectly promote Th2 responses by suppressing the development of Th1/Th17-associated inflammation. These include <italic>Fasciola</italic> helminth defense molecule (HDM), cathepsin L1 (FhCL1), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), kunitz-type molecule (Fh-KTM) and Sigma class glutathione transferase (GST) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The role of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> Prx in switching the host immune response to a Th2 phenotype during the early stages of infection has been well documented (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This is in agreement with our transcriptome profiling of EV cargo molecules (Group 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, our transcriptomics and proteomics profiling experiments have shown that the remaining immunomodulators (FhCL1, HDM, FABP, Fh-KTM, and GST sigma) are constitutively expressed across the intramammalian life-cycle stages of the fluke and are actually up-regulated as the flukes migrate through the liver, enter the bile ducts and mature into adult worms (10,11; Group 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These observations suggest that the latter molecules act to maintain the Th2/regulatory phenotype seen during chronic infection. Thus, EV cargo molecules, as well as components of the soluble secretome of adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) are developmentally regulated to facilitate the parasites migration through host tissue and to counteract host immune attack. Work is ongoing in our laboratory to characterize the EVs secreted by the NEJ stage.</p><p>We have also identified potential immunomodulators not previously thought to be secreted by adult <italic>F. hepatica</italic>, the most notable being members of the cathepsin B family. Several cathepsin B transcripts were previously identified in adult flukes, but these enzymes were not detected in the adult fluke secretome and therefore it was suggested that they have intracellular house-keeping roles (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, we have found that the small exosome-like EVs contain at least four developmentally regulated cathepsin B peptidases. This finding establishes that both cathepsin L and B peptidases are secreted by adult flukes, albeit via different mechanisms, the former via the gut and the latter via the tegument. Studies in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> have shown that a cathepsin B, SmCB2, is located in the tegument of the adult parasites (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Also identified, within the EV lumen, were a number of leaderless proteins (including Prx, heat shock proteins and annexins) that are homologs of host damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). DAMPs are leaderless cytosolic proteins that are released into the extracellular environment via atypical secretory pathways in response to tissue damage (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). They interact with pattern recognition receptors expressed by immune cells and thus set off an &#8220;alarm&#8221; system which often leads to a wound-healing scenario (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Because of their abundance within helminth secretions, we previously speculated that DAMP homologs can direct the host immune response (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and their packaging into EVs provides an alternative route for their non-canonical secretion. Although the mechanism for targeting cytosolic proteins into EVs is not fully understood, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are responsible for packaging some leaderless proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> FGF1, IL-1&#946;, and Hsp70) into EVs destined for secretion (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref><xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We identified two ABC transporters associated with the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> EV membrane (ABCB1 and p-glycoprotein 1) that may perform similar packaging roles in the parasite.</p><p>The recently available <italic>F. hepatica</italic> genome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) has allowed us, for the first time, to identify pathways involved in EV biogenesis in a helminth parasite. Exosomes arise from the endosomal system and are formed by inward budding of the multi-vesicular body (MVB) membrane that allows capture of cytoplasmic cargo. This step is thought to occur via two different routes. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) 0, I, II, and III, together with syntenin-ALIX complexes, capture ubiquitinated proteins, whereas in the ESCRT-independent pathway tetraspanins (<italic>e.g.</italic> CD63) and various lipid-related enzymes (notably sphingomyelinase) can also drive vesicle formation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The final abscission of the budding exosomes into the MVB lumen requires the AAA-ATPase VPS4 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The exosomes are then secreted into the extracellular space following the fusion of the MVB with the plasma membrane, which is dependent on small GTPases including Rab8b, Rab11, Rab27a, and Rab27b and the Rab effectors otoferlin and synaptotagmin-like protein (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). We identified <italic>F. hepatica</italic> homologs of all these key regulators of exosome biogenesis during our proteomics analysis of the 120 K EV pellet (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, it is significant that although the ESCRT pathway was well represented at the proteome level (10 members were identified in the MS analysis), the only representatives of the lipid-related/ESCRT-independent pathway were sphingomyelinase and tetraspanin CD63 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M115.053934/DC1">supplemental Table S4</ext-link>). Based on these findings we propose that exosome biogenesis in adult fluke primarily occurs via ESCRT-dependent MVB formation in the tegumental syncytium with the exosomes being shed from the apical plasma membrane (although functional studies such as RNAi are needed to confirm this). In support of this proposal, MVBs have been described during ultrastructural examination of the tegumental syncytia of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> and the related trematode <italic>E. caproni</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Furthermore, our comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 42% of the proteins identified in the <italic>F. hepatica</italic> tegumental extracts by Wilson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) were also packaged into the 120 K EVs; these contained a variety of proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> tegumental antigen 1, DM9-containing protein, annexin, and tetraspanin) that localize primarily within the tegument of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> and related trematodes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Determining the specific roles of individual pathway members during exosome biogenesis in liver fluke needs further investigation, perhaps by RNAi-mediated gene silencing which is functional in this parasite (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>).</p><p>Targeting key regulators of EV biogenesis (including sphingomyelinase, ALIX and Rab GTPases) using chemical inhibitors or RNAi has been shown to significantly reduce the number of EVs released by mammalian cells. Indeed, suppressing EV production to inhibit their effect in disease is an emerging therapeutic strategy that has yielded impressive results, notably in cancer therapy (reviewed by 14). We have identified <italic>F. hepatica</italic> homologs of several key regulators of EV biogenesis that could be targeted for parasite control if specific inhibitors can be found. Although technically challenging, selective inhibition of parasite EV biogenesis would prevent the delivery of a range of immunomodulators to host cells and, conceivably, tip the host immune balance in favor of Th1-driven parasite elimination. An alternative anti-parasite control strategy would be to block the uptake of parasite-derived EVs by host cells. Although direct fusion of EVs with the plasma membrane of target cells has been reported (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), uptake mechanisms akin to receptor-mediated endocytosis (dependent on the complement of proteins expressed on the vesicle surface) appear to be the dominant route of entry into recipient cells (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Many of the proteins we identified on the external surface of <italic>F. hepatica</italic> EVs are metabolic enzymes, or other housekeeping proteins, with reported &#8220;moonlighting&#8221; roles in other helminths and microbial pathogens (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). These include malic enzyme, enolase, GAPDH, aldolase and annexin which act as parasite adhesion molecules via interaction with plasminogen and/or fibronectin on the host cell surface (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref><xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr"/>&#8211;<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) and could be targets for blocking antibodies. Recently, it was shown that antibodies against <italic>O. viverrini</italic> tetraspanin blocked uptake of parasite EVs by host cholangiocytes, providing proof-of-concept, at least mechanistically, for this approach as an anti-parasite therapy (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).</p><p>In this report we have performed the first comparative analysis of the soluble and vesicular secretions of a helminth parasite. This was made possible by integrating the recently available genome, transcriptome, and proteome data sets for this pathogen (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our study underscores the importance of investigating the role of EVs during acute and chronic fluke infection and presents new opportunities to disrupt EV biogenesis or interaction with target cells toward parasite control.</p></sec>
