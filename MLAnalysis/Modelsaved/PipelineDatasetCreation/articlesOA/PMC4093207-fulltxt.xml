Six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. Goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with GO ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). Ruminal contents were used for DNA extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. A total bacterial clone library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene cloned sequences using universal primers. The resulting plasmids selected by <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic>-specific primers were used to construct a <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group-specific bacterial clone library. <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and GO group, respectively. In libraries, clones were classified to the genus <italic>Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>, <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> and others within the family Lachnospiraceae. Additionally, some specific clones were observed in GO group, being classified to the genus <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and others within the family Ruminococcaceae. Based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. <italic>B. proteoclasticus</italic> and <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic>) in control and GO groups, respectively. Further clones identified as <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> (5.41%) and <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> (7.89%) were specifically found in control and GO groups, respectively. The majority of clones resembled <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> (98% to 99% similarity), except for Lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. The two clone libraries also appeared different in Shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and GO group 2.91). Our results indicated that the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Butyrivibrio</italic></kwd><kwd>16S rRNA Gene</kwd><kwd>Diversity</kwd><kwd>Garlic Oil</kwd><kwd>Goat Rumen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the rumen, bacteria are largely responsible for biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated fatty acid (FA) (<xref rid="b7-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Harfoot and Hazlewood, 1997</xref>).

Nevertheless, within the complex ecosystem of rumen, there were bacteria other than <italic>B. proteoclasticus</italic> may play a predominant role in the final step of biohydrogenation (<xref rid="b1-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Boeckaert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b14-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b9-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Huws et al., 2010</xref>). Sequencing of bands from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Anaerovoax</italic> (member of the Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation (<xref rid="b10-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Huws et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggested that bacteria involved in the biohydrogenation pathway are far more complex than the previous deduced from the cultured bacteria (<xref rid="b24-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Polan et al., 1964</xref>; <xref rid="b12-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Kemp et al., 1975</xref>; <xref rid="b30-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al., 2006</xref>). This complexity is compounded by the fact that the majority of microorganisms have not yet been cultured (estimates range from 85% to 95%) (<xref rid="b18-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Nowadays, 16S rRNA molecular technique has become the most commonly used measure in microbial ecology (<xref rid="b19-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Mackie and Cann, 2005</xref>). It is reasonable to expect a culture-independent technique (e.g. 16S rRNA gene PCR) could recover more of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group fraction from the ecosystem of rumen than culture-dependent techniques. Among the molecular techniques, DGGE, one of genetic fingerprinting techniques, has its own limitation, which is relatively small fragments with length up to 500 bp (<xref rid="b21-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Muyzer and Smalla, 1998</xref>). This easily leads to biases in the estimation of diversity. Complete sequences would provide more reliable phylogenetic comparison with the available database as compared with the short sequences (<xref rid="b27-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Stackebrandt and Goebel, 1994</xref>).</p><p>It is known that garlic (<italic>Allium sativum</italic>) oil (GO) has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (<xref rid="b25-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Reuter et al., 1996</xref>). Several gram-positive bacteria are involved in biohydrogenation of unsaturated FA in the rumen (<xref rid="b7-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Harfoot and Hazlewood, 1997</xref>). This attracted our interest in whether GO could affect the diversity of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacteria in the rumen. Therefore, the present study, using sequence analysis of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene clones, aimed to investigate the diversity of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacteria and its response to GO supplementation in the rumen of goats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals, experimental design, and diets</title><p>Six local crossbred wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas (19.3&#177;1.2 kg body weight [BW], mean&#177;standard deviation) were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. Goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with GO infusion via ruminal fistula. The dose 0.04 g/kg BW was used in the present study according to the dose of GO in lamb research (0.01 g/kg BW) (<xref rid="b3-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Chaves et al., 2008</xref>) and our previous study in dairy goats (0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 g/kg BW) (<xref rid="b32-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, the dose was 0.8 g/d. The basal diet was formulated according to Feeding Standard of Meat-producing Sheep and Goats (NY/Y 816&#8211;2004; Ministry of Agriculture, China, 2004) in order to fulfill the maintenance requirements of goats. Diets consisted of grass hay (<italic>Leymus chinensis</italic>, 0.38 kg/d dry matter (DM)) and concentrate (corn meal-soybean meal-wheat bran, 0.22 kg/d DM), and were fed separately. The chemical analysis of diets has been published in our previous report (<xref rid="b31-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Garlic oil product was infused into rumen using a 1-mL syringe via ruminal fistulas immediately after the delivery of concentrate to animal. For each goat, the infusing lasted a few seconds. Hay was offered after the concentrate was ingested by the goats. Both diet and GO infusion were offered in equal portions at 08:00 and 18:00 h. No refusals of concentrate and no statistical difference of hay intake (0.33 kg/d for control and 0.32 kg/d for GO group) were observed in two groups. The main components of GO (stored at 4&#176;C; Henan Yuanhua Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) were sulfur compounds, such as the predominant diallyl trisulfide (29.3%) and diallyl disulfide (31.3%). The remaining 40% components of GO were other sulfur compounds. All goats had free access to fresh water throughout the experiment. Goats were fed individually in pens and managed in accordance with guidelines regarding animal care provided by College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification</title><p>Ruminal contents from multiple sites within the rumen were collected via ruminal fistula before morning feeding on d 28 of each period. Sample collection was performed with a suction device which could ensure the same ratio of liquid to solid in ruminal contents across animals. Samples were subsequently stored at &#8722;25&#176;C for latter DNA extraction. Prior to DNA extraction, samples were thawed and then homogenized using the Ultra Turrax T25 homogenizer (IKA Werke Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany). Total DNA was extracted from 1.5 mL homogenized ruminal contents by bead-beating for 3 min using a mini-bead beater (Biospec Products, USA), followed by phenol-chloroform extraction (<xref rid="b33-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Zoetendal et al., 1998</xref>).

The proportion of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group in total bacteria tended to be reduced as GO supplementation in the rumen. This effect may be due to the wide spectrum of antibacterial activity of GO (<xref rid="b25-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Reuter et al., 1996</xref>), which consequently leads to changes in the number of bacteria.</p><p>This study revealed that the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacteria are complex with considerable unknown species in goat rumen.

However, to our knowledge, the actual roles of bacteria belonging to the genus <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and others within the family Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae are not determined and need further investigation. Meanwhile, the vast majority of clone sequences had low similarity (&lt;97%) with the closest known isolates in both libraries, suggesting that there were many yet unknown species within the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group. The majority of microorganisms in the rumen have not been cultured (estimates range from 85% to 95%) (<xref rid="b18-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2003</xref>). This partly explains the low similarity of cloned sequences with the known isolates in the present study.</p><p>In the complex community, the majority of clones resembled the known isolate <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> with &#8805;97% similarity in the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacterial library. To our knowledge, <xref rid="b29-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Van Gylswyk et al. (1996)</xref> for the first time investigated the feature of <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> from the rumen, and reported that <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> differed sufficiently from the genus <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> and was placed in a new genus. <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> closely resembles <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in many phenotypical characteristics (<xref rid="b29-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Van Gylswyk et al., 1996</xref>). Presently, clones closely resembling <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> and <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> formed a tight and unique cluster (<italic>Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic>) in the phylogenetic tree, in which all the sequences were classified to the genus <italic>Pseudobutyrivibrio. Ps. ruminis</italic> may have a role similar to <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in biohydrogenation. Nonetheless, there were differences between them. <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> contains high medium chain FA (C12 to C15), whereas <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> contains high cellular compositions of long chain FA (C16 to C18) (<xref rid="b29-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Van Gylswyk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b15-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Kope&#269;n&#253; et al., 2003</xref>). Afterwards, <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> was reported to have high isomerase activity which converts the <italic>cis</italic>-12 bonds of linoleic acid (<italic>c</italic>9, <italic>c</italic>12-CLA) to <italic>trans</italic>-11 bonds (<xref rid="b16-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Koppov&#225; et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, species resembling <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> may contribute to the accumulation of <italic>c</italic>9, <italic>t</italic>11-CLA in the rumen. In addition, <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> is capable of hydrogenating linoleic acid and forming <italic>c</italic>9, <italic>t</italic>11-CLA, and TVA as well (<xref rid="b24-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Polan et al., 1964</xref>; <xref rid="b13-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Kepler et al., 1966</xref>). Considering the higher proportion of <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> in the libraries, <italic>Ps. ruminis</italic> may play a more important role than <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid to <italic>c</italic>9, <italic>t</italic>11-CLA.</p><p>The diversity of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacteria was modified by GO supplementation in the rumen as revealed by Shannon index. The reason behind this was not very clear. A previous report showed that high concentration (312 mg/L of culture fluid) of GO did not have detrimental effects on rumen microbial fermentation in a continuous culture trial (8 d), in contrast with the effects observed in a batch fermentation trial (24 h) (<xref rid="b2-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Busquet et al., 2005</xref>). <xref rid="b2-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Busquet et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that after longer adaptation, the microbial population inhibited by GO could be replaced by other resistant bacterial groups. This replacement might lead to modification of the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacterial community.</p><p>Among the composition of bacteria, specific appearances of <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> and <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> were observed in control and GO groups, respectively. <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> is one of the most predominant fibrolytic bacteria in the rumen (<xref rid="b8-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Hespell et al., 1997</xref>). In the future, it is important to verify the roles of <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> in the biohydrogenation in rumen. In the present study, the bacterial species (&gt;97% similarity) resembling <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> and <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> accounted for 0.70% and 0.86%, respectively, of total bacteria in goat rumen. A previous report showed that the proportion of 16S rRNA gene copies attributable to <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> and <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> were &lt;0.03% and 0.5% to 1%, respectively, of the total bacteria from the rumen of lactating cows, as investigated by relative quantification real-time PCR (<xref rid="b28-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson and Weimer, 2007</xref>). In addition to animal species, diets and methodology used were the possible reasons that caused this discrepancy in the proportion of <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in total ruminal bacteria between the two experiments. The low proportion of <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in the rumen as reported by <xref rid="b28-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson and Weimer (2007)</xref> may lead to its unlikely selection from plasmids in the total bacterial library. Owing to the antibacterial activity (<xref rid="b25-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Reuter et al., 1996</xref>), the possible inhibition of GO on <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> may also partly illustrate the disappearance of <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> in GO group library. For the lack of appearance of <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> in control library, the report that bacteriocins produced by <italic>B. fibrisolvens</italic> inhibited ruminococci growth (<xref rid="b17-ajas-27-2-179-4" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 1999</xref>) may in part explain this phenomenon.</p><p>In conclusion, this study revealed that the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group represented 12.98% of total bacteria the rumen of goats. Many unique unknown bacterial sequences were found in the <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> group bacterial library. Nevertheless, the roles of these unknown bacteria need further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Natural Science
