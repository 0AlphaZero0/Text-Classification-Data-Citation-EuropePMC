Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; (PPAR&#947;) is a nuclear receptor regulating inflammation and microglial polarization and, therefore, a potential target for resolving depressive disorders. Our hypothesis was that antidepressant effects could be achieved through anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities by PPAR&#947;-dependent microglia-modulating agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Chronic mild stress (CMS) treatment was performed on C57BL/6 mice for 6&#160;weeks. After 3&#160;weeks with the CMS procedure, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by sucrose preference (SP), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), and locomotor activity. Pioglitazone was administered intragastrically once per day for 3&#160;weeks at different doses. Neuroinflammatory cytokines were determined by real time-PCR (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot. The activated microglial state was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. N9 microglial cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharide, pioglitazone, and GW9662 to discuss the phenotype of activated microglia by RT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was demonstrated that the PPAR&#947; agonist pioglitazone (2.5&#160;mg/kg) ameliorated depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated mice, as indicated by body weight (BW), the SP test, the FST, and the TST. The amelioration of the depression was blocked by the PPAR&#947; antagonist GW9662. The expression of M1 markers (IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TNF&#945;, iNOS, and CCL2) increased, and the gene expression of M2 markers (Ym1, Arg1, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF&#946;) decreased in the hippocampus of the stress-treated mice. Pioglitazone significantly inhibited the increased numbers and morphological alterations of microglia in the hippocampus, reduced the elevated expression of microglial M1 markers, and increased the downgraded expression of microglial M2 markers in C57BL/6 mice exposed to CMS. In an in vitro experiment, pioglitazone reversed the imbalance of M1 and M2 inflammatory cytokines, which is correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor kB activation and is expressed in LPS-stimulated N9 microglial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We showed that pioglitazone administration induce the neuroprotective phenotype of microglia and ameliorate depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated C57BL/6 mice. These data suggested that the microglia-modulating agent pioglitazone present a beneficial choice for depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12974-016-0728-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pioglitazone</kwd><kwd>PPAR&#947;</kwd><kwd>Antidepressant</kwd><kwd>CMS</kwd><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Alternative activation</kwd><kwd>Cytokine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>81571174</award-id><award-id>81603503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Zili</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>863 project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015AA020505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Zili</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Key Technologies R and D Program of Sichuan Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015SZ0058-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Zili</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Systematic Research, Development and Utilization of Chinese Medicine Resources</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most frequently occurring mental disorders and has a considerable rate of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The medications currently available to treat depression, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants, are predicated on the monoamine hypothesis. Clinical evidence shows that these medications produce adequate remission of depressive symptoms in only two thirds of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, monoamine antidepressants such as SSRIs or MAOIs often have a slow onset of action and serious side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicates that depression is accompanied by inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recent study reported that the imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines plays a critical role in chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Research into the role of neuroinflammatory responses has brought new insights into the potential etiologies of MDD and provided new strategies for novel antidepressant therapies.</p><p>Microglia are resident innate immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS) and play a central role in the neuroinflammatory response. Microglia populate the CNS during early fetal life and are present in a resting state in the healthy brain but readily become activated in response to brain trauma, injury, and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In clinical research, microglial activation has also been observed in patients with depression who have committed suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Microglial activation is often categorized into classical (M1) and alternative (M2). M1 microglia may contribute to dysfunction of the neurotrophic system by expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF&#945;), IL-1&#946;, IL-6, iNOS, and CCL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the M1 phenotype of microglia, the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) may play a critical role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to neurotoxic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The M2 phenotype, sometimes called the neuroprotective microglial phenotype, releases different mediators including Ym1, arignase1 (Arg1), IL-4, IL-10, and TGF&#946; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to antagonize inflammation-induced damage in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Stress triggers neuroinflammatory processes in several brain regions including the frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. More specifically, the hippocampus is an area particularly sensitive to chronic stress, which was associated with evidence of inflammation characterized by microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, the hippocampus was chosen for investigation because of the effects of hippocampal microglial activation on stress-induced behaviors.</p><p>Pioglitazone is a highly selective agonist for PPAR&#947;, which causes the transcription of several genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism as well as with the production of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In recent years, researchers have found that PPAR&#947; agonists might be useful in a number of central nervous system diseases that have a microglia-induced anti-inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Pioglitazone is primarily used as an antidiabetic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and recently has been used in clinical trials for psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been reported that pioglitazone promotes cognitive and functional improvements in schizophrenia and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Pioglitazone is also being tested in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], Parkinson&#8217;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In clinical trials, pioglitazone worked as an adjuvant treatment for depression in insulin-resistant subjects and was associated with improvement in glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Researchers have also reported that pioglitazone had antidepressant-like effects in an acute animal model of depression, although the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effect remain largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Accumulating evidence indicates that inhibition of the microglia-mediated inflammatory response is an important strategy for the treatment of mood disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Based on the effects of PPAR&#947; on the anti-inflammatory response, in this study we evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of the PPAR&#947; agonist pioglitazone in CMS-induced depression using a mouse model and analyzed the role of M2 microglia in the antidepressant activity of pioglitazone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice weighing 18&#8211;22&#160;g were purchased from the Institute of Experimental Animals (Chengdu, China).

All the behavioral experiments were conducted in isolated behavioral testing rooms and performed by an experimenter who was blind to the identity of the experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CMS procedure</title><p>The CMS procedure was performed according to previously described methods, but with small modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The stress method followed a random schedule of commonly used mild stressors, such as food deprivation for 24&#160;h, water deprivation for 24&#160;h, cage tilting (45&#176;) for 24&#160;h, damp bedding for 24&#160;h, stroboscopic illumination for 24&#160;h, overnight illumination, and restraint stress for 2&#160;h. The mice received one stressor once per day with the same stressor never applied in two consecutive days. The stress regimen lasted for six consecutive weeks. The control group was housed in a separate room and had no contact with the stressed animals. After the 3&#160;weeks with the CMS procedure, the stress-treated mice were divided into a vehicle group and drug-treatment groups. The body weight (BW) and sucrose preference (SP) data during the first 3&#160;weeks while the mice were being stressed showed no statistical differences between the mice.

Each of the mice was placed in a chamber of an autonomous movement device to accommodate to the environment for 1&#160;min before the test. The total locomotor activity (standing and movement) of the mice was automatically recorded by the autonomous movement equipment for 10&#160;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Tail suspension test</title><p>The TST is based on the fact that mice subjected to the short-term, inescapable stress of being suspended by their tail will develop an immobile posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

</p><p>Next, we investigated whether pioglitazone exerted its anti-inflammatory effects through regulating NF-kB activity. Following the LPS treatment, the level of IkB&#945; in the N9 microglia dropped compared with all the control groups. Pioglitazone significantly increased the levels of IkB&#945; in the LPS-treated N9 cells, and GW9662 reversed this effect. Pioglitazone markedly upregulated the protein levels of IkB&#945;, which repressed the inhibition of NF-kB activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7k</xref>: <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.026).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the antidepressant effect of pioglitazone and explored its underlying anti-inflammatory responses. First, pioglitazone ameliorated depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated mice, but this amelioration was diminished by GW9662. Second, pioglitazone exerted antidepressant effects through the anti-inflammatory activity of the PPAR&#947; pathway. Third, pioglitazone improved CMS-induced depression-like behavior by regulating which of the microglial phenotypes (M1 or M2) was activated.</p><p>MDD is a common and sometimes fatal disorder that has increasingly become a public health concern. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic low-grade inflammation plays an important role in the pathology of depression. Over the past two decades, great effort has been made to identify novel targets for antidepressant therapies. It has been proposed that pioglitazone, working as an anti-inflammatory agent, could produce antidepressant responses in patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our study, we assessed the antidepressant efficacy of pioglitazone on a CMS model, which is commonly used to induce and measure depression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Because pioglitazone can cross the blood brain barrier, intragastric injection was selected for the CMS mice. Pioglitazone increased the SP in CMS-induced depressant model, which was blocked by the PPAR-&#947; antagonist GW9662. Pioglitazone as well decreased the time of immobility in FST and TST in the CMS-treated mice, indicating that pioglitazone has a therapeutic action in CMS-induced depression-like behaviors. CMS induced a decrease in locomotor activity indicated a depressive state of animals because of a loss of interest for the movement, or for exploring the environment. Pioglitazone increased spontaneous motor activity in the CMS-exposed mice, without effect on locomotor activity in normal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Gavage administration of pioglitazone was effective at the 2.5 and 5.0&#160;mg/kg doses for ameliorating the symptoms of depression, but the 2.5&#160;mg/kg dosage was more effective. Dosages of 10 and 20&#160;mg/kg were not efficacious in the CMS mice. As a result, the 2.5&#160;mg/kg dose was chosen to treat the CMS mice in the subsequent experiments.</p><p>PPAR&#947; is a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily implicated in adipocyte differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. PPAR&#947; is constitutively expressed in macrophages and CNS-resident microglia, acting as a key regulator of microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Activation of PPAR&#947; signaling has a protective role by reducing neuroinflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], a finding which may present a novel therapeutic approach for diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], Parkinson&#8217;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], schizophrenia, and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In light of the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of the PPAR&#947;-dependent signaling pathway, we investigated the antidepressant effects of pioglitazone in a CMS mice model of depression. GW9662, a selective antagonist for PPAR&#947;, was administered in this investigation in order to explore the possible role of PPAR&#947; activation on the antidepressant activities of pioglitazone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After treatment with GW9662, the BW loss was greater than that in the CMS-treated mice. GW9662 significantly inhibited the pioglitazone-induced reduction in the duration of immobility in the FST and TST. GW9662 also counteracted the effect of pioglitazone on PPAR&#947; activation. These results suggest that pioglitazone exerts antidepressant-like effects at least in part due to the activation of the PPAR&#947; pathway.</p><p>Microglia play a crucial role in inflammation modulation in the CNS, and microglial dysfunction is believed to result in CNS immune disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The role of microglia has long been considered in some neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Some interesting evidence about this role in depression has also began to emerge in recent years, e.g., microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory mediators have been reported in an olfactory bulbectomised (OB) rat model of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. According to in vitro research, microglia and their polarization status play an essential role in depression initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. These data indicated that the immune system was activated in the stressed depression models. This may have been due to the activation of M1 microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here, we showed that the microglial cells had large somas, short thick processes, and the amoeboid morphology typical of activated microglia after CMS initiation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This morphology has been explained in our previous experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Microglial activated phenotypes were determined by their polarized markers. We confirmed that the M1 markers (IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TNF&#945;, iNOS, and CCL2) were induced and that the M2 molecules (Ym1, Arg1, IL-4, IL-10, and TGF&#946;) were impaired in depression. Pioglitazone restored the balance of the M1 and M2 microglia in the hippocampus of the CMS mice (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The hippocampus has been implicated in the inhibition of stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and in the regulation of affective states and emotional behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Prior studies have shown that stress primed neuroinflammatory processes characterized by microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Microglial activation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Experiments in animal models have provided more direct evidence for a role of activated microglia in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In our experiment, we found that pioglitazone can control microglia activation and neuroinflammation in CMS-induced depression. These data indicated that microglia-modulating agents had therapeutic benefits for MDD, thereby defining a new biological activity for pioglitazone by showing that pioglitazone acts in modulating microglial phenotypes in a CMS-induced rodent model of depression.</p><p>Inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in depression. In our previous study, an imbalance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be one of the pathogeneses of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this current research, a higher expression of IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and TNF&#945;, and a lower expression of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-&#946; were observed in the hippocampus of CMS-induced mice (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). A relatively large body of evidence has suggested that the PPAR&#947; agonist pioglitazone can regulate the inflammatory response and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. After pioglitazone treatment of the CMS mice, the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules was reduced and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased. These results were consistent with recent findings that PPAR&#947; agonists can transition M1 into M2 phenotype as well as enhance the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF&#946;, both of which are pro-neurogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In order to ensure the specific response of activated microglia in stress-induced depression, experiments using LPS treatment of N9 microglial cells were performed. LPS can cause behavioral changes that indicate depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. LPS stimulation can break the balance of microglial activation (M1 vs. M2), but the resulting imbalance in the levels of mRNA and protein can be ameliorated by pioglitazone administration (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a&#8211;i</xref>). The results of an in vitro study were consistent with the mice test. Thus, the M1-M2 imbalance should be a focus in studying animal models of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. NF-kB pathway activation plays an important role in pro-inflammatory gene expression after stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. NF-kB normally exists in the cytoplasm, binding to its inhibitory proteins (IkB) and remaining inactive. Dissociation of IkB induces activation of NF-kB and facilitates the transcription of inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In our experiment, the protein expression of IkB was reduced after an LPS stimulation of N9 microglial cells. Pioglitazone upregulated the IkB&#945; expression in the LPS-treated N9 cells and GW9662 reversed the inhibitory effects of pioglitazone on NF-kB activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7k</xref>). These results indicated that the role of pioglitazone in preventing the NF-kB activation was partially linked to the upregulation of IkB expression. The present findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of pioglitazone are associated with a PPAR&#947;-mediated suppression of the NF-kB signaling pathway with consequential inflammatory cytokine expression in microglial cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the chronic administration of pioglitazone induced the neuroprotective phenotype of microglia in parallel with the amelioration of depression-like behaviors in CMS-treated C57BL/6 mice. Pioglitazone, a microglia-modulating drug which regulates anti-inflammatory activity, may partially account for the observed antidepressant response. This finding suggests that targeting microglia could pave the way for new depression treatments.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p>
