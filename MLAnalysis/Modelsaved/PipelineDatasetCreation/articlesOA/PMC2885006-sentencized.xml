<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike the entire gp120, the OD is structurally stable and contains the surfaces that interact with both the primary and secondary cellular receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary strain-specific neutralizing target, the V3 loop, lies within the OD, as do epitopes for two cross-reactive neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), b12 and 2G12, and the contact sites for a number of inhibitory lectins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to published data for the clade B OD, the majority of the polyclonal response to the complete clade C OD is to the V3 loop; deletion of the loop substantially reduces immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the loop sequence was substituted for the epitope for 2F5, a well-characterized human cross-neutralizing mAb, a polyclonal response to the epitope was generated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In its final mature form, the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is composed of two polypeptide chains: gp120 is responsible for binding to the primary and secondary receptors used by the virus for cell entry and gp41 is responsible for fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (Fenouillet et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An effective neutralizing antibody response must block one of these stages if it is to provide broad cross-protection against infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The initial receptor binding step, enabled by gp120, is a predominant target for the generation of such antibodies (Pantophlet &amp; Burton, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to gp120 can be broadly protective, shown by the isolation of several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) capable of neutralization of many HIV clades both in vitro (Binley et al., 2004) and in vivo (Baba et al., 2000; Gauduin et al., 1997; Kitabwalla et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While possible, however, the absence of a functionally similar class of responses to gp120 in polyclonal serum has effectively challenged vaccine development for HIV based on envelope alone (Pitisuttithum et al., 2006) or in combination with other viral antigens (Russell et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The basis of the failure to generate high-titre neutralizing immune responses has been attributed to active immune evasion mechanisms developed by HIV over time, such as glycan shrouding of sensitive sites (Wei et al., 2003), profuse sequence variation at key sites (Catasti et al., 1995, 1996; Zolla-Pazner et al., 1999) and structural heterogeneity (Moore et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As a result, each of these areas has become a focus for immunogen design that might elicit more beneficial immune responses than the wild-type molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recent examples include the purposeful engineering of glycan sites to enhance immunogenicity (Li et al., 2008), forced immune focus on V3 (Zolla-Pazner et al., 2008) and the generation of subunit gp120 immunogens such as the outer domain (OD) (Chen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The rationale for the latter strategy has been clarification of the role of the structural flexibility of gp120 in the immune response through comparisons between the crystal structures of free gp120 and ligand-bound gp120 (Chen et al., 2005; Kwong et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These show that, of the three structurally defined features, inner domain, bridging sheet and OD, only the OD remains as an inflexible component following receptor binding (Yang et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The isolated OD is therefore a potentially invariant three-dimensional target for vaccine design, providing that a response can be generated which contains antibodies with appropriate specificity (Pantophlet &amp; Burton, 2006; Zhou et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Preliminary immunization with the isolated OD of HIV-1 YU2, a clade B virus, yielded a response that did not focus on the V3 loop, wholly present within the OD, possibly as a result of loop cleavage (Yang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, a similar immunization using the OD from HIV-1 CN54, a clade C isolate (Rodenburg et al., 2001; Su et al., 2000), fused to the human Fc domain resulted in a strong response that could be mapped to the V3C3 region of gp120 through the use of bacterially expressed gp120 fragments (Chen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Fc fusion appeared to target antigen uptake to FcR-bearing antigen-presenting cells, as immunization with an Fc fusion domain mutated in the FcR binding site was far less immunogenic (Chen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, the fine specificity of the response was not described, meaning it could not be determined whether V3 dominated the response (as might be expected), whether other specificities were present, whether the serum was neutralizing or whether substitution of the loop could be used to redirect the response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As noted, OD is a vaccine target primarily because of its invariant structure, but its presentation of the V3 loop is also of interest, as several strategies directly address the V3 loop despite its relatively poor exposure on primary isolates (Hartley et al., 2005; Zolla-Pazner, 2005; Zolla-Pazner et al., 2008) and the increasing realization that V3 reactivity can be more broadly neutralizing than once thought (Pantophlet et al., 2007; Zolla-Pazner et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here, using HuFc fusion as an immune enhancer, we compare serum responses to the CN54 OD and parallel constructs lacking the V3 loop or with the V3 loop replaced by the epitope for Hu-mAb 2F5 (Muster et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The range of epitopes possible was assessed by generation of a mAb panel to the CN54 OD, followed by their epitope specificity and ability to neutralize. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that the CN54 OD generates a serum capable of V3 recognition, although the fine specificity of the response was not described (Chen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>As this response was significantly different from that described for the YU2 OD (Yang et al., 2004), we sought to investigate the immunogenicity of the clade C OD in more detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To do this, we constructed two variants of the OD-Fc molecule that were previously shown to be immunogenic; OD(DL3)-Fc has 29 residues from the centre of the V3 loop sequence removed, while OD(2F5)-Fc has the same deletion reconstructed to contain the sequence ELDKWAS, the core epitope for the widely cross-neutralizing human mAb 2F5 (Muster et al., 1994) (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The 2F5 epitope is part of the wider membrane-proximal external region (MPER) present on the HIV envelope spike and located in the transmembrane domain, gp41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The complete MPER region also contains the epitope for a second neutralizing mAb 4E10 and has been shown to be immunogenic in infected individuals (Alam et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In addition, both the OD and its variants contained the substitutions at residues 295 and 394 that reintroduced the 2G12 epitope into the CN54 sequence that was used (Chen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Binding of 2G12 thus provides a sensitive measure of OD conformation before and after manipulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Following expression using high-throughput baculovirus formation (Zhao et al., 2003), recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatent of infected insect cells by two-stage affinity purification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The eluted proteins were characterized by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting; they were essentially pure, of the anticipated molecular mass and showed little evidence of breakdown (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In particular, significant cleavage of the V3 loop was not apparent in the parental molecule, in contrast to that described for the HIV YU2 OD (Yang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>When the purified proteins were used as antigens in ELISA, each OD-Fc fusion protein reacted equivalently with mAb 2G12, although the level of OD(DL3) was marginally reduced when compared with the other two (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>As expected, only OD(2F5)-Fc reacted with human mAb 2F5 (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>As before (Chen et al., 2007), b12 binding to each OD construct was found to be negligible (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Purified proteins were used to immunize BALB/c mice (n=3) in a standard immunization regimen using 10 μg protein at 2 weekly intervals for 6 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The sera from each group (two per construct) were pooled and reactivity with non-tagged CN54 gp120 was tested by ELISA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>While all the OD constructs were immunogenic in the Fc fusion format, overall reactivity was severely reduced in the sera generated using OD(DL3)-Fc and OD(2F5)-Fc when compared with the parental OD-Fc molecule (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Although it was lower in titre, the response to the two deleted molecules of the V3 loop was further analysed using Western blotting with these sera on a variety of antigens, including the homologous immunogens OD(DL3)-Fc or OD(2F5)-Fc, a non-Fc but His-tagged OD (OD-His), deglycosylated OD-His and an unrelated fusion protein consisting of the Yersinia pestis capsular protein caf1 fused to the 2F5 epitope (R-947). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The pooled serum response to the loop-deleted variant OD(DL3)-Fc showed equivalent reactivity with OD(DL3)-Fc, OD(2F5)-Fc and glycosylated OD-His, but improved reactivity to the deglycosylated form of OD-His. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>No reactivity was apparent with R-947 (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The pooled serum to OD(2F5)-Fc showed preferential binding to the cognate antigen when compared with the OD(DL3)-Fc serum (Fig. 2a, b, compare lanes 1 and 2), similar preferential binding to deglycosylated OD-His when compared with the glycosylated form (compare lanes 3 and 4) and distinct reactivity to R-947 (Fig. 2c, lane 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>From these data, we conclude that the OD is immunogenic but that much of the immunogenicity resides in the V3 loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Despite a lower titre response, the loopless OD variants retain a level of immunogenicity which includes a response to grafted epitopes such as the 2F5 epitope used here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the observation of glycan shielding (Wei et al., 2003), we observed marginal but consistent increases (about 25 % based on densitometry) in signal when deglycosylated OD was used as an antigen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>To provide finer specificity for the overall serum responses to the OD and OD(DL3) immunogens, further ELISAs were performed using a set of 20-residue biotinylated peptides overlapping by 12 residues and spanning the CN54 gp120 sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The data for each pooled serum were compared with the serum response to the complete CN54 gp120 generated previously using a gp120-Fc fusion protein (Chen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The profile for the gp120 serum was broadly consistent with that expected, namely an abundant reaction to the inner domain, the V1/2 loop, the V3 loop and the C-terminal region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>When compared with the full-length molecule, the serum to OD showed similar V3 dominance, albeit with a shifted specificity towards the C-terminal half of the loop (peptide D1) and an enhanced V4 response (peptides D11 and D12), but it lacked significant reactivity with the C terminus (peptides E7 and E8) (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>As the N and C termini of gp120 lie close together in the crystal structure (Kwong et al., 1998), this might suggest that the region is presented together in the case of gp120, a situation that cannot occur with OD as the N terminus is absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In addition, the shifted V3 loop specificity and revelation of V4 indicate that, in addition to the avoidance of the unwanted response to the inner domain, the OD is presented differently from the complete gp120. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Despite this, when compared with the parental OD, the pooled serum to OD(DL3) showed very poor reactivity to any of the immobilized peptides, confirming the CN54 V3 loop as the predominant epitope within the global serum response to the outer domain (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>As the OD proved to be immunogenic in the Fc format and the fine specificity of the polyclonal response indicated the possibility of neutralizing antibody (e.g. the V3 loop specificity), a panel of mAbs was generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice (n=3) were immunized and boosted with OD-Fc as described before, but using a dose of 20 μg, and the spleen cells were fused at day 60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>mAbs specific for the CN54 OD were confirmed by ELISA screening on OD-Fc and counter-screened on an unrelated Fc fusion protein (HCVE2-Fc) to eradicate mAbs reactive with the Fc domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Exhaustive screening identified eight mAbs specific for the OD (Supplementary Table S1), of which two mAbs (2B7 and 4E5) were identified directly as V3-specific based on lack of reactivity with OD(DL3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The mAbs were screened further using a variety of recombinant gp120 fragments, competition assay and peptide binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>From this analysis, the fine specificity of the V3 mAbs was mapped to the centre of the loop, including the GPG crown, for both mAbs (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>mAb 2B7 exhibited slightly broader binding, with strong interaction to peptide C10 upstream of the crown, while 4E5 reacted only with peptide C11 and C12 (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mAb 4D3 was unambiguously mapped to a 30-residue sequence (425–455 of CN54 gp120), representing the C-terminal β-strand of the bridging sheet (Kwong et al., 1998) (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The remaining mAbs did not map unambiguously but could be distinguished by competition: mAb 3F8 failed to compete with any other mAb, while mAbs 4E1, 3F9, 1G12 and 1H8 cross-competed with each other but not with 4D3 (bridging sheet) or 2B7/4E5 (V3 loop). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>To assess neutralization, the polyclonal sera and mAbs were used in an infectivity reduction assay in TZM-bl cells (Wei et al., 2002), with three different HIV viruses: CN54, the clade C PBMC isolate from which the immunogen was derived; MN, a Tier 1 neutralization-sensitive clade B TCLA virus; and 93MW965.26, a neutralization-sensitive Tier 1 clade C pseudotype (Mascola et al., 2005; Montefiori, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The broadly cross-neutralizing human mAb b12 and normal mouse sera provided positive and negative controls, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The polyclonal sera failed to neutralize both CN54 and MN, and showed only a marginal ability to prevent entry of the highly sensitive 93MW965.26 (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The facts that the OD sera were generally of low titre (Fig. 2) and that the gp120 serum contained a high degree of reactivity with the inner domain (Fig. 3) probably explains the poor levels of neutralization seen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the V3 loop mAbs (2B7 and 4E5) effectively neutralized 93MW965.26 although the activity was of limited breadth, as only marginal diminution of MN entry was observed (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The neutralization ability of 2B7 was stronger than that of 4E5 (IC50 of &lt;2 μg ml−1 for 2B7 against 93MW965.26, compared with &gt;10 μg ml−1 for 4E5), paralleling its broader reactivity with V3 loop peptides (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>2B7 also neutralized CN54 in a dose-dependent manner, while the activity of 4E5 was equivocal (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>None of the remaining mAbs demonstrated convincing neutralization when compared with 2B7, although 3F8 and 4E1 showed weak (∼50 %) neutralization of all three viruses at 50 μg ml−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The established cross-clade neutralizing antibody b12 directed at the CD4 binding of gp120 site failed to neutralize CN54 and was less effective than 2B7 with 93MW965.26 (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, it efficiently blocked entry in the MN-based assay, in which neither 2B7 nor 4E5 clade C mAbs were active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the isolated OD can elicit a range of antibody specificities when made immunogenic as, in this case, by fusion with Fc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Among them are V3-loop-specific antibodies that can be powerfully neutralizing for at least two clade C isolates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The search for an immunogen capable of generating a substantial cross-clade neutralizing response to HIV and that is amenable to production and formulation as a vaccine has been arduous (Karlsson Hedestam et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the immune response to clade C viruses is generally less well documented than that against clade B, despite their wider distribution (Bures et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The relatively recent revelation that the inner domain of g120 is flexibly mobile and effectively generates irrelevant antibody responses has focused attention on gp120 molecules that are ‘stabilized’ as trimers (Beddows et al., 2006, 2007; Iyer et al., 2007; Schulke et al., 2002) or isolated fragments (Chen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The definition of the responses that are capable of being produced by such fragments is therefore an important dimension of candidate vaccine design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to produce the defined outer domain of a current clade C isolate in a conformationally relevant form and we incorporated a re-engineered epitope for the conformational human mAb 2G12 to achieve this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Neither deletion of the V3 loop nor its substitution by the 2F5 epitope abolished 2G12 reactivity, confirming that the isolated outer domain is conformationally immobile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Purified proteins, fused to Fc as a molecular adjuvant, generated antibodies that reacted both with non-tagged OD and full-length CN54 gp120. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Reactivity was largely directed to the V3 loop and, although partially blocked by the presence of carbohydrate, the V3 loop contained a substantial proportion of reactivity with the polypeptide backbone, not the carbohydrate, as reactivity to deglycosylated gp120 was evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of the 2G12 epitope, no 2G12-like reactivity was observed in any of the sera generated (data not shown), confirming the unique properties and rarity of the 2G12 isolate (Roux et al., 2004; Trkola et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Although replacement of V3 with the 2F5 epitope successfully generated a serum, its titre was low and no significant neutralization was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>It is possible that repeated immunization, additional adjuvants, additional flanking sequence or multiple copies of the 2F5 sequence could improve this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the observed polyclonal responses to the OD, a panel of mAbs generated to the intact OD included V3 specificity which could be accurately mapped and was neutralizing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>As expected, neutralization appeared to be clade-C-specific but was potent for at least one of the V3 mAbs, 2B7, whose epitope spanned the V3 loop crown and residues N-terminal to it, a well-characterized immunodominant site in other HIV isolates (Korber et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>OD would seem worthy of further investigation for the generation of clade C responses that omit the inner domain of gp120 or for the presentation of alternate grafted epitopes to improve the prospects for cross protection. </plain></SENT>
