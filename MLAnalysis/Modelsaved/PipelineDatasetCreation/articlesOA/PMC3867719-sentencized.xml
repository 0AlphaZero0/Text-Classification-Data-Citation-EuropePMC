</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NBN (formerly known as NBS1) is a protein of 754 amino acid composed of three regions: the N-terminus (containing a forkhead associated domain (FHA) and two breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) carboxy-terminal (BRCT) tandem domains), a central region (containing sites phosphorylated by the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase), and the C-terminus (containing the MRE11- and ATM-binding domains) [1-11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The NBN protein is a member of the MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex, which is involved in nearly all aspects of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) metabolism, from lesion recognition, to DNA repair by both non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways, to cell cycle control [12-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, DNA damage may arise as the consequence of physiological cellular metabolism or produced by the exposure to environmental pollutants [19-21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the pivotal role of the MRN complex in the maintenance of genomic stability, any genetic variation of the NBN gene may have detrimental effects on cells capability to properly face with DNA damage, and consequently may predispose to cancer and to the genetic disease named Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) [13, 22-24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NBS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, immunodeficiency, spontaneous chromosomal instability, sensitivity to ionizing radiations and a high incidence of malignancy [25-27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cancer, and in particular malignancy of lymphoid origin, is the primary cause of death among NBS affected individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>More than 70% of the malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma [28-32], though solid tumours as medulloblastoma [33-35], rabdomiosarcoma of the perianal region [36], melanoma [37], breast [38-41], prostate [42], ovarian [43], lung [44] and colorectal cancers [45] were also represented. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most common NBN mutation is due to the deletion of five base pairs (bps) in exon 6 (657del5), which leads to protein truncation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition to this mutation, which affects mostly Central Europe populations, at least 11 other truncating and missense mutations have been reported so far in NBS patients [2, 46-53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some evidences point to a possible correlation between cancer risk and NBN at the heterozygous status, as it occurs in blood relatives of NBS patients [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, such a relationship has been corroborated by additional studies which identified carriers for the NBN 657del5, R215W and I171V mutations overrepresented in cancer patients [23, 30-32, 37, 41, 54-62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The observation that in tumors recovered from NBN carriers the inactivating mutation was not detected on the second allele, seems to suggest a dominant negative mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Such an effect in NBN monoallelic mutated tumors could be due to truncated NBN proteins as result of an alternative NBN translation [9, 63]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Beside classical miscoding mutations associated with either clinical signs of the NBS disorder or a functionally alterated NBN protein, a certain number of both low- and high-frequency polymorphisms have been reported to be distributed over the 16 exons of the NBN gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>According to the Environmental Genome Project (EGP), so far 675 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported for the NBN gene [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Among them, 84 are considered common based on a minor allele frequency of &gt;5% [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As for NBN mutations, also for NBN gene polymorphisms acting as slow-penetrance genes a possible association with different kinds of malignancy has been evaluated in the last 15 years, in that DNA polymorphisms may bring to subtle structural alterations of proteins and consequently modulation of cancer susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In (Table 1) is reported a list of a selected panel of NBN genetic variants, their effects on amino acid change, and their localization into protein’s domains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here we provide the reader with the state of the art on this topic, limiting the attention to SNPs of the sole NBN gene, though in many of the presented works a large panel of polymorphisms in gene involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and metabolism of genotoxics was also investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The risk of cancer associated with NBN SNPs appears to differ by cancer type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In particular, based on the published papers, the association of NBN SNPs has been restricted to a panel of hematological and solid tumors (Table 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is considered the most common neoplasia of the skin, accounting for more than 75% of all skin malignancies [66, 67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Though locally invasive and slow-growing, BCC is characterized by recurrence and tissue destruction [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Regarding the etiology of BCC, it has been proposed that both genetic factors and environmental determinants, as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, may contribute to the development of this kind of cancer [69, 70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genes whose products are enzymes involved in the removal of DNA lesions introduced by UV-light exposure may play a critical role in the etiology of BCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this respect, non-synonymous SNPs known for their potential capability to modulate gene functions are worth to be analysed [71]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The association of the rs1805794 NBN genetic variant with BBC risk was assessed in two case-control studies on Caucasian individuals in Europe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The first one comprised cohorts of patients (241) and controls (574) from Sweden and Finland [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Genotype distributions for the common rs1805794 variant were in accordance with those expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>No differences between controls and carriers of the rs1805794 NBN variant were observed with respect to BCC risk [72]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The second study, considered one of the largest association study, was conducted on a cohort of 529 BCC patients from Central Europe countries (i.e., Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia) and 533 matched healthy control individuals [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Also in this study, the only polymorphism analyzed for a possible association with BCC was the rs1805794. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium distribution was detected for cases and controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the authors found a gender relationship between the NBN SNP and BCC, in that in men homozygous for the C-allele an odd ratio (OR) of 2.19 (95% CI, 1.23-3.91) was calculated, whereas in women the calculated OR was 0.84. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In addition, a multiplicative gene-gene interaction effect was found on the BCC risk association among men carrying the genotype CC XRC3/CC NBN, with an OR reaching the value of 8.79 (95% CI, 2.10-36.8), compared to the genotype TT XRC3/GG NBN [73]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Urinary bladder cancer ranks ninth in worldwide cancer incidence, and particularly it represents the seventh most common malignancy in men and the seventeenth in women [74-77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Some risk factors for bladder cancer have been recognized in environment exposure to aromatic amines, cigarette smoking exposure and uptake of several compounds as phenacetin and cyclophosphamide [78, 79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, a growing body of evidence has emerged indicating that culture-mediated and socioeconomic factors contribute substantially to the etiology of bladder tumors and may play an even more important role than the occupational environment [80]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The exposure to environmental agents and by-products of cellular metabolism results in DNA damage, which, if left un-repaired, can lead to carcinogenesis [81, 82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>A certain number of studies have been conducted in order to establish an association between urinary bladder cancer risk and genetic polymorphisms for a large panel of genes involved in DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1, RAD51, XPC, XPD, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, XRCC4, etc), in the metabolism of genotoxic carcinogens (e.g., GSTT1, NAT1, NAT2, NQO1, MTHFR, etc), and in cell cycle control (e.g., cyclin D1) [83-93]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In particular, only few studies have analyzed the possible role of the NBN genetic variants in cancer susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study in which 299 Caucasian bladder cancer patients from hospitals in the Stockholm area and 278 matched controls were gathered, the genotype distribution of SNPs was in accordance with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, and the frequency of the common rs1805794 SNP in CC homozygous condition, between healthy controls and bladder cancer cases indicated a marginal significant difference (OR 1.64, 95% CI, 0.92-2.90, P=0.09) [82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>No association was detected between 1086 Caucasian bladder cancer patients and 1020 controls with respect to four NBN genetic variants (i.e., rs1063045, rs1805794, rs867185, rs1063053) [88]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in a case-control study on 771 bladder cancer cases and 800 controls of both Caucasian and non-Caucasian ethnicity, the association of bladder cancer risk with nine NBN variants, located at the 3’-UTR (i.e., rs14448, rs9995, rs13312986, rs1063054, rs13312981, rs2735383, rs1063053) and in coding regions (i.e., rs1805794, rs769420) was evaluated [90]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Brest cancer is the most common form of cancer among women, for which both genetic and environmental factors have been reported [94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Although the cause of breast cancer is still obscure in the majority of cases, for a significant fraction of cases the age at the first child’s birth and the family history represent well-established risk factors [95]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, it has been also reported that breast cancer patients might be deficient in the repair of DNA damage [96]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Indeed, approximately 5% to 10% of breast cancers are </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>related to an inherited gene mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Of these cases, 84% of hereditary breast cancers and more than 90% of hereditary ovarian cancers are caused by mutations in either BRCA1 or breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Familial aggregation involving genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 seems to be the result of the additive effect of multiple low penetrant genes [97]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Overall, pathogenic mutations in TP53, ATM, CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2, together with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, account for less than 20-25% of the excess familial risk of breast cancer, thus supporting the notion that also other cancer susceptibility genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Based on the recognized role of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 in different aspects of DSBs damage response and repair [98], many association studies have been carried out with respect to genes involved in the NHEJ and HRR repair, and particular between NBN and breast cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several SNPs identified in genes involved in the HRR pathway (e.g., XRCC2, XRCC3, NBN, and RAD51) may influence the repair capacity of breast cancer patients and, in turn, confer genetic predisposition to disease [99]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In this respect, any association for the rs1063045, rs1805794, rs709816, and rs1061302 NBN SNPs was found in 2205 Caucasian patients and 1826 controls (age range 45-74 years) [100]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In a similar way, no association was found between the rs1805794 polymorphism and breast cancer risk in another hospital-based study performed on 766 African-American (681 matched controls) and 1273 Caucasian women with breast cancer (1136 matched controls) (age range 21-74 years) [101]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In a series of other relatively small studies, conducted on 221 Finnish sporadic breast cancer patients and Poland familial cases [102], 220 Chinese population patients [103], 336 Caucasian patients [104], 97 cases selected from high-risk families from the French-Canadian population [105], and 289 Caucasian Portuguese patients [95], no association between the rs1805794 and breast cancer risk was reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, a certain number of studies pointed to a significant association between NBN gene variants and sporadic breast cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>A study carried out in the genetic homogeneous Taiwanese population analyzed the rs1805794, rs1805790, rs709816, rs1061302, and rs1063045 SNPs of the NBN gene in 559 female breast cancer patients and 1125 healthy female controls [106]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In this study, a significant 1.29-fold increase in risk (95%, CI 1.00-1.69) was reported for the only rs1805790 variant in the form of the GG homozygous genotype [106]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The rs36226237 promoter variant was found significantly increased in a cohort of 97 high-risk non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 breast cancer families from the French-Canadian population compared with 74 unrelated healthy controls from the same origin [105]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In another study, the rs1805794, 924T&gt;C*, and 30537G&gt;C* NBN genetic variants were analyzed in a hospital-based case-control study of 421 relatively young non-Hispanic Caucasian women (≤55 years: range 22-55 years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>An association of the variant rs1805794GG (in an allele-dose response manner; GC OR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.00-1.78; CC OR: 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-2.94) and of carriers of the homozygote rare variant 924CC (OR: 4.55, 95% CI 1.51-13.7) with breast cancer risk was found [107]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Such an association was also found for haplotype analysis in allele/dose response manner, but not for the 30537G&gt;C polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>A similar result, showing a significant trend of breast cancer risk with increasing numbers of GC/CC genotypes of the rs1805794 variant in a very small sample of African-American patients (63 cases and 78 controls) was reported [104]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Since the association between NBN genetic variants and increased risk of cancer appear to be still inconsistent and controversial, as evidenced in the present review for the various SNPs analyzed, tumor type and ethnicity, efforts have been made toward meta-analysis studies restricted to either specific polymorphisms, as the miscoding rs1805794 which lead to the E185Q amino acid substitution, or specific tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The various meta-analysis studies available are herein reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>A study, restricted to the rs1805794 NBN variant, was based on 16 eligible case-control studies (17 set data) comprising a total of 9734 patients and 10325 controls of mixed populations (14 studies on Caucasians, 1 on African-Americans and 2 for the Chinese population) [196]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The association was estimated using dominant (GC/CC vs GG), additive (CC vs GG) and recessive (CC vs CG/GG) genetic models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>For the GC/CC dominant model an OR value of 1.06 (95% CI 1.00-1.12, p=0.05) was found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The effect of the rs1805794 variant was further analyzed in a stratification analysis, showing an increased risk of cancer particularly among the Caucasians (OR: 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14 p=0.03) [196]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Concerning a possible association of the rs1805794 SNP and breast cancer risk, a systemic review and meta-analysis study was carried out based on 10 case-control eligible studies of 4452 cases and 5665 controls of mixed population (seven studies on Caucasians, two in African-Americans, and one in Asian population) [197]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The authors considered different genetic models: the allele contrast model (C vs G), the codominant model (CC vs GG; CG vs GG), the dominant model (CG/CC vs GG), and the recessive model (CC vs GG/CG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>It was reported an OR value of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for the codominant model CC vs GG, suggesting that the individuals carrying the CC genotype had a significant decreased risk to develop breast cancer, compared with those with the GG genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The recessive model, CC vs GG/CG, showed a borderline significant association with breast cancer, while no association was detected in subgroup analyzed for ethnicity [197]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In a recent systemic review and meta-analysis study, the association of the rs1805794 NBN variant with lung cancer risk was addressed [198]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Six eligible case-control studies (two studies performed among Caucasians and four studies performed among the Chinese population) were considered, for a total of 2348 lung cancer patients and 2401 cancer-free controls. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In particular, subgroup analysis performed by ethnicity suggested a significant association of rs1805794 with lung cancer risk under a dominant comparison model in the Asiatic population (OR: 1.22, 95% CI, 1.06-1.41, p=0.005), but not in Caucasians (OR: 1.17, 95% CI, 0.91-1.50, p=0.220) [198]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>OR values were not adjusted for confounding factors as age and smoking habits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Concerning the Caucasian population, the two studies included in the meta-analysis have shown either no association (343 Norwegian origin patients for non-small cell lung cancer and 413 healthy controls) [199] or a significant association only among a small sample of non-smoking women (OR: 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.8) and low-dose smoking women (OR: 4.8, 95% CI 1.5-15.7) [200] for the rs1805794 polymorphism. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Though many studies have been carried out to establish a possible association between NBN gene polymorphisms and increased risk of cancer, the results still remain inconclusive and sometimes contradictory (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Based on the “Venice criteria” so far strong epidemiological credibility was found for the NBN miscoding E185Q (rs1805794) variant and bladder cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the E185 aminoacid is located within the BRCT1 domain of NBN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This domain is involved in NBN interaction with BRCA1, allowing the formation of the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC) that is responsible for the recognition and repair of DNA DSBs [205]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Meta analysis studies have the advantage of collecting a large number of cases, however some of them need to be considered with caution since they are not adjusted for relevant confounders, such as age and lifestyle, in particular smoking habits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions need to be taken into account in future studies, since the carcinogenic mechanisms involving alteration in DNA repair pathways are affected by exposure to environmental agents, and more relevance should be put to report about the level of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>It has been stressed that, whereas genotyping is accurate, environmental exposure is often classified with a high degree of uncertainty [204]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In addition, association studies would greatly benefit from analysis of haplotypes and combined effect of several SNPs in multiple and different genes taking part in DNA repair, since it is becoming recognized that the contribution of single variants to the genetic risk of cancer may be very modest. </plain></SENT>
