The molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating spur-type growth have not been elucidated. In the present study, miRNAs and the expression of their potential target genes were evaluated in shoot tips of &#8220;Nagafu 2&#8221; (CF) and spur-type bud mutation &#8220;Yanfu 6&#8221; (YF). A total of 700 mature miRNAs were identified, including 202 known apple miRNAs and 498 potential novel miRNA candidates. A comparison of miRNA expression in CF and YF revealed 135 differentially expressed genes, most of which were downregulated in YF. YF also had lower levels of GA, ZR, IAA, and ABA hormones, relative to CF. Exogenous applications of GA promoted YF shoot growth. Based on the obtained results, a regulatory network involving plant hormones, miRNA, and their potential target genes is proposed for the molecular mechanism regulating the growth of YF. miRNA164, miRNA166, miRNA171, and their potential targets, and associated plant hormones, appear to regulate shoot apical meristem (SAM) growth. miRNA159, miRNA167, miRNA396, and their potential targets, and associated plant hormones appear to regulate cell division and internode length. This study provides a foundation for further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism underlying spur-type apple architecture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apple</kwd><kwd>shoot</kwd><kwd>miRNAs</kwd><kwd>internode</kwd><kwd>SAM</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="13"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="24"/><word-count count="12308"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apple is an important fruit crop in temperate regions of the world. The use of dwarfing rootstocks and high density planting of apple trees is common in commercial orchards as it increases yields per unit area and reduces the cost of management practices, such as pruning. The use of spur-type scion varieties is one of effective methods used to facilitate high-density planting, along with the use of dwarfing rootstocks.</p><p>&#8220;Fuji&#8221; is the major cultivar planted in China, accounting for more than 65% of apple plantings. Several spontaneous &#8220;Fuji&#8221; spur-type mutants have been identified and utilized in the breeding and planting of &#8220;Fuji&#8221; apples. The spur-type growth habit in apple is characterized by a reduced number of vegetative shoots and a corresponding increase in the number of fruiting spurs, short distances between nodes, compact and dense growth, and dark green and relatively thick leaves (Lapins and Lapins, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>). Spur-type apple trees exhibit a high rate of bud break but have weak branching, characterized by rosette foliage and overall reduced levels of vegetative growth. The anatomical structure of spur-type shoots is characterized by vessel elements that are shorter and narrower than in standard-type shoots. The spur-type vessel elements have longer ends (tails), and thicker secondary cell walls (Yang et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Several earlier studies have reported that spur-type apple trees have lower levels of GA than standard-type trees, are less sensitive to applications of GA, and have reduced rates of conversion of GA19 to GA20 under high temperature conditions in summer (Steffens and Hedden, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Song et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The majority of shoot elongation is the result of cell expansion, with gibberellins playing a dominant role in this process. GAs promote internode elongation and overall shoot elongation by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and expansion. The &#8220;green revolution,&#8221; semi-dwarf varieties of cereal crops, are defective in GA biosynthesis and/or signaling. Auxin is recognized as the major hormone involved in shoot development (Gallavotti, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Auxin also influences stem elongation and regulates the formation, activity, and fate of meristems. Cytokinins (CK) inhibit the differentiation of cells in the SAM and instead promotes cell division. CK promotes SAM enlargement partly through WUSCHEL, and defects in CK synthesis or perception reduces the size of the SAM size (Leibfried et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kyozuka, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Except for GA, however, the levels of plant hormones in spur-type apples have not been reported or are unclear.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous 20&#8211;24 nt non-coding RNAs. In plants, miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, 5&#8242; capped, spliced, and polyadenylated at the 3&#8242; end to create pri-miRNAs. DICER-LIKE (DCL) protein processes the stem-loop structure in pri-miRNAs, creating pre-miRNA, and subsequently miRNA/miRNA<sup>*</sup> duplexes. A single mature miRNAs is generated by the removal of the miRNA<sup>*</sup>. The mature miRNA is recruited into a RISC complex (RISC) which degrades mRNA targets or suppresses their translation. Plant miRNAs play a critical role in growth, organ development, phase changes, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, disease resistance, stress tolerance, and mineral assimilation and translocation.</p><p>Some miRNAs in plants have been shown to regulate plant architecture. A point mutation in <italic>OsSPL14</italic> perturbs the cleavage of <italic>OsSPL14</italic> transcripts by OsmiR156, which affects tiller number and lodging resistance, as and enhances grain yield (Jiao et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). OsmiR397 down regulates a laccase-like protein <italic>OsLAC</italic> involved in brassinosteroid sensitivity, and thereby promotes panicle branching (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). OsMIR444 participates in a miRNA/MADS/TCP/D14 (miMTD) regulation module, in which D14 functions in strigolactone (SL) signaling to control tillering, by suppressing <italic>OsMADS57</italic> expression (Guo et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In pear trees, miR6390 is involved in the transition from endormancy to ecodormancy by targeting <italic>PpDAM</italic> transcripts, degrading them and stimulating the release of <italic>PpFT2</italic> (Niu et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Overexpression of the <italic>MbDRB1</italic>, a gene involved in miRNA biogenesis in <italic>Malus baccata</italic>, increased the level of adventitious rooting, curly leaf, and columnar-like architecture (You et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms responsible for spur-type architecture is unclear. Few studies have been conducted on the role of miRNAs in the architecture of fruit trees. In the present study, miRNA and degradome sequencing was used to identify miRNA involved in shoot development in <italic>Malus domestica</italic> &#8220;Nagafu 2&#8221; and spur bud mutation &#8220;Yanfu 6.&#8221; Morphological indicies, plant hormone levels, miRNA, and target gene expression, and the application of various hormone treatments were also measured and/or used to compare and contrast shoot development in &#8220;Yanfu 6&#8221; vs. &#8220;Nagafu 2.&#8221; This comprehensive analysis was conducted in order to identify and determine the potential role of miRNA-mediated regulatory network in shoot growth and involvement of miRNA in the architecture of fruit trees and other woody, perennial plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 using standard-type &#8220;Nagafu 2&#8221; and spur-type mutant &#8220;Yanfu 6&#8221; apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic>) trees that were grafted on Malling &#8220;M.26&#8221; rootstocks and planted in 2009.

A total of 202 unique sRNAs sequences were assigned to 41 microRNA families (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S3</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of family members revealed that the number of miRNA members varied among the different miRNA families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The top five miRNA families, mdm-miR156, mdm-miR172, mdm-miR171, mdm-miR167, and mdm-miR399, had more than 10 members. For example, the mdm-miR156 family had 31 members. mdm-miR1511, mdm-miR391, mdm-miR7125, mdm-miR7126, mdm-miR827, and mdm-miR858 only had one member. miRNA156 is conserved in embryophytes (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Taylor et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and represents the largest microRNA family in pear (Wu et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which like apple, is a member of the Rosaceae. The differences in the number of members in the different microRNA families may be due to the different evolutionary rates in the microRNA families and to genome duplication events. Two known microRNAs families, mdm-miR7123, and mdm-miR7128, were not found to be present in the libraries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), therefore, these microRNAs may not be expressed in apple shoot tips. Statistical analysis of the read counts for the known miRNA families indicated significant differences in the level of expression among the different miRNAs (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S3</xref>). Read counts of some miRNAs in a family were nearly the same, but some were obviously different. For example, all of the mdm-miR395 family members had the same number of counts. In contrast, mdm-miR172a, mdm-miR172o, and mdm-miR172g-h, members of the mdm-miR172 family (15 members), had a high read count, while mdm-miR172 a-c, mdm-miR172i-k, and mdm-miR172 m-o had a moderate read count, and mdm-miR172l had a low count.

YF trees have short internodes and reduced shoot length. Whether or not spur-type apple trees are also a fruiting characteristics, has been a source of debate, especially since the spur type phenotype of siblings derived from the spur-type apple exhibiting great variability (Fideghelli et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Regardless, spur-type apple cultivars undoubtedly moderately reduced tree size as compared to standard-type trees (Costes et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Unlike dwarfing rootstocks that reduce the proportion of lateral buds that develop into long shoots during the early development of trees (Lauri and Trottier, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Seleznyova et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), YF produces a dwarf tree architecture by reducing the duration of shoot vegetative growth and shortening internode length.</p><p>In the present study, YF trees were demonstrated to contain lower levels of GA, ZR, IAA, and ABA. An application of GA promoted cell division in the shoot apical meristem and an increase in internode elongation in YF trees (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A,B</xref>). In contrast, YF trees exhibited no response to IAA. Previous studies have reported that the application of 6-benzylaminopurine and GA to apple nursery trees increased shoot elongation to a much greater extent than applying 6-benzylaminopurine alone (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Doric et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

A total of 42 known miRNAs and 93 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed in the shoot tips of CF and YF trees. The differential expression of the miRNAs appeared to be related to the differences in shoot development observed in the two genotypes. This supports the premise that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of shoot architecture in YF trees.</p><p>Internode length and the number of nodes are two essential components that determine plant height. Compared to internode length, however, the impact of shoot apical meristem activity has a greater effect on shoot development. For example, the shoot apical meristem is responsible for terminating cell division when trees enter dormancy or when the vegetative meristem is converted to a floral meristem. The number of nodes is also determined by continued cell divisions in the shoot apical meristem. Therefore, factors affecting SAM development would also affect the number of nodes produced on a shoot during an annual growth cycle. Our results indicate that miRNA164, miRNA166, and miRNA171 are potentially involved in SAM development and differentially expressed in YF vs. CF apple shoot tips. A degradation of the NAC-domain transcription factors, CUC1 and CUC2 (Mallory et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Raman et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) by miRNA164 has been reported to constrain the expansion of the boundary domain by degrading the NAC-domain transcription factors, CUC1 and CUC2 (Mallory et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Raman et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CUC1, CUC2, and CUC3 function redundantly in initiating SAM and establishing organ boundaries (Aida et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Abolishing miR164 regulation of CUC2 resulted in progressive enlargement of the boundary domain (Raman et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The shoot tips in YF trees exhibited abnormal shoot tips, with the dome of the apex appearing a little larger than the apical dome in CF trees. This phenotype is also present in apples with columnar architecture and in some dwarfing rootstocks (Petersen and Krost, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The <italic>mir164abc</italic> mutant frequently displayed extremely short internodes, small floral organs, and reduced fertility. Thus, miRNA164 may be involved in abnormal shoot and internode development in YF trees.</p><p>Among all of the miRNAs, miRNA166 had the highest level of expression in the shoot tips. miRNA166 potentially inhibited SAM development by targeting a set of HD-ZIP transcription factors that are important for maintaining pluripotency in shoot apical meristems (Williams et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). AGO10 binds miRNA165/166 to prevent its association with the broadly expressed AGO1 and thus prevents the degradation of HD-ZIP transcription factors in the SAM (Zhou et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). YF trees have a high proportion of spur shoots. Many of the lateral shoots in YF trees stopped elongating soon after bud break. Thus, miRNA166 may be involved in apple regulating the spur shoot habit in apple trees.</p><p>miRNA171 potentially targets the HAM subfamily genes, <italic>SCL6-II, SCL6-III</italic>, and <italic>SCL6-IV</italic>, within the <italic>GRAS</italic> gene family. miRNA171 affects the maintenance of SAM indeterminacy by regulating the shoot apical meristem WUS-CLV feedback loop (Schulze et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The expression level of miRNA171 was significantly lower in YF trees than in CF trees. The height of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing miR171c was significantly higher than wild-type plants (Long et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Upregulation of OsMIR171c in a delayed heading mutant rice genotype exhibited pleiotropic phenotypic defects, including a prolonged vegetative phase and a delayed heading date (Fan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These observations correspond to the reduced growth in YF shoots, relative to shoot growth in CF trees, and the earlier date in which growth ceased in YF trees, relative to CF trees.</p><p>As a result, it appears that the final internode phenotype results from an interplay between cell division and elongation that progresses in an inverse directions. Cell number has a more predominant role in regulating the growth and development of internodes because of cell length increases only two to three times, but cell numbers increase by 10 to 30 times (Pallardy, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Analysis of the expression pattern of cell cycle genes further supports the premise that the SAM in YF trees has a lower rate of cell division than in CF trees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). The expression of <italic>MdCYCD, MdCYCB1;2, MdCYCD1;3</italic>, and <italic>MdRBR1</italic> was significantly lower in YF shoot tips than in CF shoot tips. The period of high expression of the cell cycle genes corresponded to the period of rapid shoot growth; suggesting that cell division may play an instrumental role in shoot growth, and more so than cell elongation. Ripetti et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) also found that genetic variation in internode length could be primarily attributed to cell numbers, while cell length played more of a secondary role. The miRNA sequencing and GO annotation in the present study identified several miRNAs related to cell division.</p><p>miRNA159 potentially deregulates its target genes, MYB33 and MYB65, in vegetative tissues, and inhibit growth by reducing cell proliferation (Alonso-Peral et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The expression of miRNA159 was significantly higher in CF shoot tips than in YF shoot tips. The miRNA159 loss of function mutant, <italic>mir159ab</italic>, has an enlarged shoot apical meristem and smaller lateral organs (Alonso-Peral et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). miRNA159 and its targets have also been reported to be involved in GA-mediated flowering (Gocal et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Achard et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The expression of miRNA159 in YF shoot tips exhibited little response to the application of GA during the first 6 days after spraying GA. Interestingly, miR159a and miR159b also remained unchanged after the application of GA in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Alonso-Peral et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The potential target gene of miR159a, MYB65, however, was downregulated after the application of GA in <italic>Malus domestica</italic>. Thus, GA maybe regulate the expression of the target of miRNA159 to produce the miRNA159 phenotype.</p><p>miRNA396 negatively regulates its potential target gene, GROWTH RESPONDING FACTOR (GRF), to affect cell division in shoot meristems, leaves, and roots. miRNA396 appears to act as a strict repressor of the GA and CK pathways, and negatively regulates cell proliferation by decreasing cell division activity and the expression of cell cycle-related genes (Wang et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The potential downregulation of the GA pathway genes by miR396 corresponds to the dwarf phenotype observed in miR396 overexpressing lines (Liu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The high level of expression of miRNA396 in YF shoot tips may inhibit cell division and internode elongation. miRNA396 was downregulated after GA application. Thus, GA may affect downstream GA response by downregulating miRNA396.</p><p>miRNA167 regulates vegetative and reproductive growth by controlling the expression of auxin response factors 6 and 8 (ARF6/8) in plants. Overexpression of miRNA167a results in twisted leaves, short inflorescences, and arrested flower development; thereby fully producing the mature phenotype of arf6arf8 plants (Wu et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The expression of miRNA167 was significantly higher in YF shoot tips than in CF shoot tips. GA treatment downregulated miRNA167 at first, and then subsequently induced it; resulting in upregulating. But GA also increased the expression of the target gene, ARF6. DELLA has been reported to interact with ARF6 and inhibit ARF6 DNA-binding to modulate ARF6 gene expression (Oh et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence, GA may promote cell elongation mechanisms in YF trees that involve miRNA167-ARF-mediated responses.</p><p>Based upon the findings of the current study, we present a model to explain how plant hormones and miRNA are involved in regulating the shoot development in spur-type YF trees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>). Low levels of IAA, GA, and CK are associated with reduced shoot growth in YF trees. GA appears to play a major role in regulating shoot development. Low levels of GA in YF shoots may reduce the number of cell divisions in the SAM, relative to the SAM in CF shoots, thus causing shoot growth to cease much earlier in the YF trees as compared to in the CF trees. In the model, low expression of miRNA164, miRNA171, and high expression of miRNA166 and their potential target genes affected SAM development and reduced the duration of shoot growth in YF trees. Of the three miRNAs, the regulation of miRNA166 by GA appeared to play a major role in shoot tips elongation in YF trees. The high levels of expression of miRNA167 and miRNA396, and the low expression of miRNA159, in YF trees appears to have inhibited cell division and reduced internode length. The results of the present study, and the hypothetical model presented, contributes to a better understanding of shoot development in perennial plants; especially those that exhibit a spur-type growth architecture.</p><fig id="F13" position="float"><label>Figure 13</label><caption><p><bold>Tentative model for the association of miRNAs with the phytohormone crosstalk regulation the spur type apple tree architecture</bold>.
