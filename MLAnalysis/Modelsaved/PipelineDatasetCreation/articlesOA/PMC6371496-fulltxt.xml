In 107 cases with available clinical information we standardized the reported phenotypes according to the Human Phenotype Ontology. The most commonly reported features were developmental delay (98%), anomalies of the corpus callosum (96%), microcephaly (76%) and lissencephaly (agyria-pachygyria) (70%), although reporting was incomplete in the different studies. We identified a total of 121 specific variants, including 15 recurrent ones. Missense variants cluster in the C-terminal region around the most commonly affected amino acid position Arg402 (13.3%). In a three-dimensional protein model, 38.6% of all disease-causing variants including those in the C-terminal region are predicted to affect the binding of microtubule-associated proteins or motor proteins. Genotype-phenotype analysis for recurrent variants showed an overrepresentation of certain clinical features. However, individuals with these variants are often reported in the same publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">With 166 individuals, we present the most comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic standardized synopsis for clinical interpretation of <italic>TUBA1A</italic> variants.

The alpha and beta families, consisting of at least 15 alpha and 21 beta-tubulin genes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], encode tubulin proteins which form heterodimers as fundamental components of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Along with microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins on the external surface, tubulin proteins participate in substantial cellular processes of intracellular transport, cell division and neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In recent years, an increasing number of tubulin genes were linked to a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders, the &#8220;tubulinopathies&#8221; (<italic>TUBA1A</italic>, MIM#602529; <italic>TUBA8</italic>, MIM#605742; <italic>TUBB2A</italic>, MIM#615101; <italic>TUBB2B</italic>, MIM#612850; <italic>TUBB3</italic>, MIM#602661; <italic>TUBB</italic>, MIM#191130; <italic>TUBG1</italic>, MIM#191135) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tubulinopathies are characterized by a broad spectrum of cortical and subcortical malformations and a variety of clinical features. Major cortical anomalies include lissencephaly (agyria-pachygyria), polymicrogyria or polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia and cortical gyral simplification. Subcortical anomalies affect the corpus callosum, the cerebellar vermis, the brainstem, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Further clinical features are microcephaly, global developmental delay and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, <italic>TUBA1A</italic> represents the main tubulinopathy gene and accounts for 4&#8211;5% of all lissencephaly cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Using exome analysis in three unrelated individuals with severe developmental delay we identified three heterozygous de novo missense variants in the <italic>TUBA1A</italic> gene.

Of these, 28 provided clinical reports and were thus included in this study. All available clinical data was standardized in accordance to terms of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast to a previously established classification combining cortical and subcortical features like &#8220;classic lissencephaly&#8221;, &#8220;lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia&#8221;, &#8220;lissencephaly with agenesis of the corpus callosum&#8221; and &#8220;centrally predominant pachygyria&#8221; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we analyzed the features independently. If only the classification was mentioned, we used the independent underlying features where HPO terms were available (e.g. &#8220;microlissencephaly&#8221;: microcephaly HP:0000252&#8201;+&#8201;agyria HP:0031882). Nevertheless, we kept composite terms typically used together in the literature such as &#8220;agyria-pachygyria&#8221; (HP:0031882, HP:0001302) if they affected the same brain structure. Data assessment comprised 11 neuroradiological features, including anomalies of cortical gyration, corpus callosum, brainstem, basal ganglia, internal capsule, cerebellum, cerebellar vermis, hippocampus, ventricular dilatation, 4th ventricle dilatation, grey matter heterotopia, and other radiological findings. Clinical features included congenital microcephaly, microcephaly, developmental delay, epilepsy, neuro-ophthalmological findings including strabismus and nystagmus, other neurological symptoms including spasticity and muscular hypotonia, and additional features (HPO terms shown in Tables&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Neuroradiological features of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-associated tubulinopathy</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>F</italic> Female, <italic>M</italic> Male, <italic>N</italic> Number, <italic>N/A</italic> Not applicable, <italic>NS</italic> Not specified</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Clinical features of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-associated tubulinopathy</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>F</italic> Female, <italic>M</italic> Male, <italic>N</italic> Number, <italic>N/A</italic> Not applicable, <italic>NS</italic> Not specified</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par19">We further included available likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants from ClinVar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], denovo-db [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and DECIPHER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

This classification is based on the interaction of the tubulin monomer with neighboring tubulin proteins within the polymer (heterodimer, protofilament, microtubule), with MAPs, or motor proteins. While functional evidence was present only for a minority of the variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], most mutational effects are based on localization-dependent predictions.

This is in agreement with an ExAC Z-score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] of 6.23, confirming that <italic>TUBA1A</italic> is extremely depleted of missense variants in the general population. This resulted in high computational prediction scores independent of causality. Thus, variants might be reported to be likely pathogenic or pathogenic (ACMG class 4 or 5) despite relatively low computational scores and variants found in healthy controls might have scores above the recommended respective thresholds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). After analyzing the relation of three ensemble computational prediction scores and expected pathogenicity, we concluded that computational prediction scores are of limited utility for predicting pathogenicity in <italic>TUBA1A.</italic> We suggest that segregation with the disease in the family or de novo occurrence, two major criteria of the ACMG guidelines for variant interpretation, are more appropriate for variant classification.</p><p id="Par35">Based on the observation of the mutational distribution we analyzed a possible relationship between genotype and phenotype. We observed clustering of disease-causing variants in the region around the amino acid residue Arg402 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b and c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The residue Arg402 is located in the interaction site of various MAPs or motor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] which are involved in different processes including the polymerization and stabilization of microtubules and intracellular vesicle transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Defects in some MAPs or motor proteins result in a similar clinical spectrum as observed for specific MAP-associated <italic>TUBA1A</italic> variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Overall, variants of the Arg402 residue and other specific recurrent variants, which are predominantly MAP or motor protein interacting, were previously associated with overlapping neuro-radiological features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Indeed, we could show a non-uniform distribution for reported clinical features and the recurrent variants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), indicating a possible genotype-phenotype relation. This observation might in part be attributed to detailed structured morphological categorization of brain anomalies used by different authors and individual preferences for certain terms. In addition, difficulties in the interpretation of the radiographic cortical and subcortical anomalies or technical differences in brain imaging could represent a possible confounder. Of note, recurrent variants with similar phenotype combinations were often reported by the same authors indicating a possible observational bias (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d), thus limiting the interpretation of these genotype-phenotype relations. Another problem hindering a more detailed investigation is the high degree of missing data we recognized for several phenotypic categories. The directed acyclic graphs structure of HPO allows grouping of specialized terms into less specialized parent terms. Future development of algorithms comparing the phenotypic similarity between groups of individuals with the same or functionally similar pathogenic variants might alleviate some of these problems and allow further characterization of variant specific phenotypes. However, some of these endeavors could be hampered by the difficulty to distinguish between missing information and normal phenotype in published reports. This is especially problematic as HPO describes &#8220;phenotype abnormalities&#8221; but has no terms for normal phenotypes. We propose standardization in clinical reporting of rare disease cases based on expert recommendations with a minimal scheme covering disease specific phenotypes.</p><p id="Par36">Even though <italic>TUBA1A-associated</italic> tubulinopathy is the most common tubulinopathy form, our results indicate that more clinical and mutational information is necessary to evaluate a potential genotype-phenotype correlation. This became apparent in fetuses, where we and others observed the most severe phenotypic spectrum compared to born cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This could not be explained by specific properties of the identified variants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). We therefore propose that additional variants in other genes or random developmental processes in cellular pathways in the respective individuals are underlying the phenotypic variability.
