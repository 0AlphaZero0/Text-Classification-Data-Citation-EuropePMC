At the end of the 2-year CSF-470 immunization protocol, patient #006 developed several lung and one subcutaneous melanoma metastases; this later was excised. In this report, we analyzed the changes throughout vaccination of immune populations in blood and in the tumor tissue, with special focus on the T-cell repertoire. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked increase in CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD20<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes infiltrating the metastasis relative to the primary tumor. Lymphocytes were firmly attached to dying-tumor cells containing Granzyme-B granules. Whole-exon sequencing assessment indicated a moderate-to-high tumor mutational burden, with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> as the main oncogenic driver. Mutational signature presented large numbers of mutations at dipyrimidines, typical of melanoma. Relevant tumor and immune-related genes from the subcutaneous metastasis were addressed by RNA-Seq analysis, revealing expression of typical melanoma antigens and proliferative tumor-related genes. Stimulatory and inhibitory immune transcripts were detected as well as evidence of active T-cell effector function. Peripheral blood monitoring revealed an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells by the end of the immunization protocol. By CDR3-T-cell receptor &#946; (TCR&#946;) sequencing, generation of new clones and an increase in oligoclonality was observed in the peripheral T-cells immune repertoire throughout immunization. A shift, with the expansion of selected preexisting and newly arising clones with reduction of others, was detected in blood. In tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, prevalent clones (50%) were both new and preexisting that were expanded in blood following CSF-470 immunization. These clones persisted in time, since 2&#8201;years after completing the immunization, 51% of the clones present in the metastasis were still detected in blood. This is the first report of the modulation of the TCR&#946; repertoire from a melanoma patient immunized with the CSF-470 vaccine. After immunization, the changes observed in peripheral immune populations as well as in the tumor compartment suggest that the vaccine can induce an antitumor adaptive immune repertoire that can reach tumor lesions and persists in blood for at least 2&#8201;years.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cutaneous melanoma</kwd><kwd>CSF-470 vaccine</kwd><kwd>T-cell receptor &#946; immune repertoire</kwd><kwd>cancer immunogram</kwd><kwd>tumor immune infiltration</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="18"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="5869"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our group has developed the therapeutic vaccine CSF-470, an allogeneic mixture of four-lethally irradiated cutaneous melanoma (CM) cell lines co-adjuvated with bacillus Calmette&#8211;Guerin (BCG) and recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), for the adjuvant treatment of stages IIB&#8211;IIC&#8211;III CM patients. Recently, in a randomized phase II study, CSF-470 vaccine has demonstrated a significant benefit in distant metastasis-free survival versus interferon alpha 2b (IFN&#945;2b), with good tolerability and evidence of induction of adaptive and innate immune responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Assessment of the mechanisms leading to clinical benefit in adjuvancy is challenging, and monitoring different aspects of the tumor&#8211;immune system axis can be of vital importance. Along with this line, a cancer immunogram recently proposed by Blank et al. aims to analyze multifactorial aspects related to tumor immunotherapy, with focus on T cell function, including tumor foreignness, general immune status, immune cell infiltration, presence of immune checkpoints (ICKs) and other inhibitory molecules, and sensitivity to immune effectors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, integral exomic and transcriptomic analysis of non-microdissected metastatic melanoma tissues allows determining tumor mutations and expression of genes related to tumor biology and immune status, which can have an impact on patient&#8217;s outcome. Recently, the usefulness of targeted RNA-Seq in profiling a panel of immune transcripts has been proposed to measure the abundance of immune transcripts in tumor biopsies to develop a gene-expression profile instrument to predict clinical response to immunotherapy (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we present the analysis of samples obtained from a CM patient treated with the CSF-470 vaccine (CASVAC-0401 study) who developed metastases at the end of the 2-year immunization treatment, among them a subcutaneous metastasis (SC mts) which was resected. This case allowed us to study the local immune response and its relationship with changes in the peripheral blood immune response during 4&#8201;years of follow-up (F-UP). We characterized tumor-driver genes and immune profile oriented gene-expression pattern in the SC mts; dynamics of the blood immune response throughout the vaccination protocol was also followed by analysis of the T-cell receptor &#946; (TCR&#946;) immune repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Case Report</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Patient&#8217;s #006 Case Presentation and Treatment</title><p>In October 2010, patient #006, a 50-year-old Caucasian woman, had a primary CM resected from her back. Three months later, an axillary sentinel lymph node with micrometastasis was excised (January 2011) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). After a radical axillary lymph node resection, 0/18 metastatic lymph nodes were found. In June 2011, the patient signed informed consent and entered the CASVAC-0401 study, being assigned to the CSF-470 arm. CASVAC-0401 is a single institution, randomized, open-label phase II/III study, to investigate in CM pts stages IIB, IIC, and III post-surgery (adjuvancy) the efficacy and safety (primary objectives) as well as the quality of life and immune response (secondary objectives) of the CSF-470 vaccine versus medium-dose IFN-&#945;2b treatment (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</uri>: NCT01729663). Vaccine CSF-470 is an allogeneic vaccine consisting of irradiated CM cell lines plus BCG and rhGM-CSF; immunization protocol was followed as described (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Two years later, at the end of the 13-vaccine immunization program, the patient developed SC and lung metastases; the SC mts was resected (June 2013); a part of the biopsy was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for histological analyses, and a part was preserved at &#8722;80&#176;C in RNAlater (Ambion). Bilateral lung nodules of up to 1-cm diameter were detected by a CT scan. Since this tumor had the BRAFV600E mutation, the patient started treatment with Vemurafenib 960&#8201;mg bid on December 2013, achieving a complete response within 3&#8201;months of treatment. This patient remained stable up to December 2016, when she developed lung, bone, and brain mts for which she received holocraneal radiotherapy. The last contact was on June 2017, and the patient was still alive.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient #006 timeline and immune infiltrate analysis in post-vaccination subcutaneous metastasis (SC mts). <bold>(A)</bold> The patient was randomized to the CSF-470 vaccine arm of CASVAC-0401 study.

The SC mts that developed in the patient&#8217;s back, in the vicinity of the previous scar, had defined expansive edges, with areas of epithelioid tumor cells adjoined by zones of dense fibrosis and zones fulfilled with brisk lymphocyte infiltration (Figure S1II in Supplementary Material).

After elimination of germline variants, somatic mutations revealed a total number of 712 SNPs and 33 InDels. We found 239 mutations in coding sequences: 7 were insertions; 72 were synonymous variants, and 156 were missense mutations. Tumor mutational burden was moderate to high (TMB&#8201;=&#8201;745 variants/50.39 Mb&#8201;=&#8201;14.8), suggesting that immunogenic neoantigens might have been generated. Among driver genes, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, FBXW7<sup>S608T</sup>, and CIC<sup>&#916;374</sup> heterozygous mutations were found. Analysis of mutational signature revealed fingerprints related to failure of DNA double-strand break-repair by homologous recombination; large numbers of CC&gt;TT dinucleotide mutations at dipyrimidines due to ultraviolet light exposure, typical of melanoma, were also found (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).</p><p>RNA-Seq of the SC mts revealed the expression of several melanoma-associated Ags, many of them shared with the CSF-470 vaccine cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Also, typical melanoma markers, such as MC1R, vimentin, MITF, CD63, and LADH were abundant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Since the whole tissue biopsy was sequenced, containing both tumor and brisk immune cells infiltration, we focused on transcripts that could reflect the immune expression profile of the tumor microenvironment. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I (HLA-A) and &#946;2M transcripts were abundantly expressed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Stimulatory ICKs such as CD40, as well as inhibitory ICKs such as CTLA4, B7-H3, TIGIT, Tim-3, and LAG-3 were detected. PD-1/PD-L1 transcripts were scarce. Immunosuppressive molecules IDO, galectins 1, 3, and 9, and HLA-E were expressed, but no IL-10 was detected. Markers of inflammation such as TNF-&#945;, CSF1R, and CXCL8 were also abundant. We also searched in our RNA-Seq results for a panel of transcripts related to T-cell receptor signaling, tumor infiltration by immune cells, and other immunological functions that are key for anticancer immunosurveillance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We found elevated expression of leukocyte population markers; Ag processing and presenting genes; and IFN-I and II response genes. Finally, transcripts of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells markers, TCR co-expression and receptor signaling, and granzyme and perforin genes were abundantly detected (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Abundance of selected immune-related transcripts from subcutaneous metastasis from patient #006.</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Abundance of selected transcripts is expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM)</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Diversity of the TCR&#946; Immune Repertoire in Blood and SC mts</title><p>An increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in the peripheral compartment after immunization with the CSF-470 vaccine, as well as a brisk infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in the SC mts, was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). We analyzed the dynamics of the T-cell repertoire throughout immunization with the CSF-470 vaccine, since a central question was whether TIL clones were already present in blood previous to CSF-470 immunization, which expanded and were recruited to the SC mts; or if new T-cell clones arose after immunization. We performed NGS of the CDR3 region of the TCR&#946; repertoire genes, since within the TCR, this region contains the highest variability, making it a suitable molecular identifier for tracking individual T-cell clones (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). TCR&#946; sequence analyses were performed in the SC mts TIL and in PBMC samples obtained before (PBMC-PRE), during CSF-470 immunization (PBMC-POST-1 and PBMC-POST-3), and 2&#8201;years after completing the vaccine protocol (PBMC-POST-4) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A; Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S6</xref> in Supplementary Material).</p><p>To describe the diversity of the TCR&#946; immune repertoire of each sample, considering the number of unique receptors (richness) and their relative abundances (evenness), different analyses were performed. Analyses of the 100 most frequent TCR&#946; clones (TOP100) indicated an increment in their cumulative frequency throughout immunization, supporting preferential expansion of a subpopulation of T-cell clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). TOP100 TIL clones from the SC mts showed an oligoclonal TCR&#946; repertoire almost attaining the top-quartile most frequent clones (TQ) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Also, the frequency of each TCR&#946; clone in the immune repertoire (%), ordered from highest to lowest, was plotted in function of its cumulative frequency (%) to compare blood samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). PBMC-PRE sample presented a linear pattern, which is related to an homogeneous distribution of the TCR&#946; repertoire. A similar pattern was observed for PBMC-POST-1. Instead, a sigmoideal pattern was observed for PBMC-POST-3 sample, as less T-cell clones make up more of the entire repertoire. Thus, there was a progressive enrichment in a subset of T-cell clones. A similar pattern was observed for PBMC-POST-4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). When analyzing the proportion of clones that make up the top cumulative frequency of 25 [TOP-25 or Top-Quartile (TQ)] or 50 (TOP-50), it decreases over time; further supporting the expansion of a subpopulation of T-cell clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Distribution and tracking of the T-cell receptor &#946; (TCR&#946;) immune repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and subcutaneous metastasis from patient #006. <bold>(A)</bold> Percentage of total TCR&#946; clones covered by the TOP100 clones, the 100 most frequent ones (nucleotide sequences). <bold>(B)</bold> Total TCR&#946; clones (%), from highest to lowest, in function of their cumulative frequency (nucleotide sequences). <bold>(C)</bold> The proportion of TCR&#946; clones (%) that constitute the TOP-25 or TQ clones, and the TOP-50 clones are shown (TOP-25/50, the proportion of clones that make up the top cumulative frequency of 25/50). <bold>(D)</bold> Pattern distribution of TCR&#946; clones in total PBMC, total tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and Top-Quartile TIL (TQ-TIL); the number of clones for each pattern and total clones analyzed in each case is indicated.

Opposite to that, a proportion of clones either decreased (pattern 4) or became undetectable by the end of the immunization protocol (pattern 5).</p></sec><sec id="S2-7"><title>Characterization of the TCR&#946; Immune Repertoire Infiltrating the SC mts</title><p>Analysis of shared amino acid sequences among TIL and blood samples revealed that all samples shared 10% of the clones, and 16% were shared by TIL and PBMC-POST3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E). When total TIL clones were analyzed considering the tracking patterns for peripheral clones, 53% of TIL clones were only detected at the tumor microenvironment (pattern 6); 13.6% corresponded to preexisting clones that expanded during immunization (pattern 1), clones emerging during immunization and detected at 12&#8201;months (2.2%, pattern 2) and 24&#8201;months by the end of immunization (15.9%, pattern 3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). 9.3 and 6.0% of TIL clones diminished their frequency in blood or were no longer detected. When looking at the most frequent Top-Quartile TIL clones (TQ-TIL), preexisting clones (pre-vaccination) were enriched (pattern 1, 31.6%), prevailing along with late-emerging clones (pattern 3, 19.8%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). 58% of TQ-TIL clones corresponded to pattern 1 clones that have expanded in blood at least three times; and 45% of TQ-TIL clones were in the 2.4% most abundant clones in PBMC-POST-3 sample (pattern 3) (data not shown). This supports the idea that a considerable proportion of abundant TIL clones (TQ-TIL) are among those that were expanded in blood, either preexistent or emerging post-vaccination. TQ-TIL clones detected only at the tumor microenvironment accounted for 31.6% (pattern 6) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D).</p><p>A F-UP blood sample, obtained 2&#8201;years after patient #006 completed the protocol and after 2&#8201;years of intermittent treatment with vemurafenib (PBMC-POST-4 sample), revealed that TCR&#946; clones found in the tumor microenvironment could still be detected in circulation. Indeed, the cumulative frequency of TIL clones detected in blood doubled from 5% (PBMC-PRE) to 10.7% total frequency (PBMC-POST-3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). Two years later (PBMC-POST-4 sample), TIL clones were still detected in blood with a cumulative frequency of 8.9% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). Actually, 51% of total TIL clones were shared with the POST-4 sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>G). These 706 common clones were distributed mainly in four patterns, 56% of them corresponded to patterns 1 and 2; while 21.6% were detected only at POST-4 blood sample (pattern 3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>H; Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). When looking at TQ-TIL clones shared with PBMC-POST-4, expanded preexisting and clones arising during immunization accounted for 70.8% (patterns 1 and 2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>H). These results suggest that CSF-470 vaccination in patient #006 modulated the repertoire of T-cell clones and their frequency, and that particularly those clones expanded during immunization persisted at least 24&#8201;months after the end of the vaccination protocol.</p><p>T cells with shared Ag specificities should share conserved CDR3 structural domains and amino acid sequences, as they recognize the same epitopes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). An oligoclonal pattern of V&#946; expression should thus be observed if Ag-driven stimulation causes clonal expansion. We found that this patient presented a V&#946; gene usage distribution that was mainly conserved in time in peripheral PBMC and TIL (Figure S4A in Supplementary Material). When analyzing total TIL, as well as TIL that persisted in time (PBMC-POST-4&#8201;&#8745;&#8201;TIL) according to their distribution patterns, the V&#946; gene usage distribution was similar (Figures S4B,C in Supplementary Material).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present here the analysis of samples from patient #006 enrolled in the CASVAC-0401 trial treated with the CSF-470 vaccine, who simultaneously developed one SC and several lung mts after receiving 13 immunizations during 2&#8201;years (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The SC mts was excised and offered the opportunity to correlate the tumor and peripheral immune responses during immunization and 2-year F-UP. Immunohistochemical analysis of the SC mts revealed a 10-fold increase of CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes with respect to the primary tumor; less so (3-fold) for CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Evidence suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and macrophages effector cells were actually killing tumor cells was obtained, supported by ISNT and GZMB expression. The reason why some tumor areas are infiltrated whereas other parts of the tumor appear unreached is not known. It does not appear to be due to an unequal distribution of immune suppressor cells, since FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were scarce and even macrophages appeared to be lysing tumor cells.</p><p>To elucidate if immune effector cells preexisted before vaccination and/or were triggered by it, we compared the TCR&#946; immune repertoire of blood and TIL. Peripheral blood monitoring revealed an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells by the end of the immunization protocol. Along vaccination, a shift in the peripheral CDR3-TCR&#946; immune repertoire, with the expansion of preexisting clones (2% of total clones), the appearance of new clones (50% of total), and diminution of others (45% of total), was observed. Although preexisting TCR&#946; clones might recognize private or melanoma-associated Ags previous to vaccination, their expansion suggests a positive effect of vaccination. A central question, however, was if vaccination induced lymphocyte clones able to travel into the metastatic foci. Most important, analysis of TIL clones revealed that 29.5% of them were preexisting or late-emerging in blood. Therefore, vaccination induced the generation and expansion of T cell clones that were able to migrate into tumor sites. When looking at the most frequent clones (TQ-TIL), which might be the more relevant for antitumor function (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), preexisting as well as late-emerging clones became prevalent, accounting for 51% of the total. The proportion of TIL clones present in the blood repertoire doubled in time throughout immunization, remaining at levels higher than detected at baseline. An F-UP blood sample, obtained 2&#8201;years after completing the immunization protocol, showed that half of TIL clones could still be detected; although it should be pointed that patient #006 was treated with vemurafenib for 21&#8201;months when the F-UP sample was taken (09/2015). The patient achieved a complete response to vemurafenib of 31&#8201;months duration, after which she progressed with lung, bone, and brain mts. There is evidence that vemurafenib does not interfere with the viability or functionality of T cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this case, we could still detect TCR&#946; TIL clones 2&#8201;years after completing immunization with the CSF-470 vaccine; conceivably, further Ag-input was delivered to the immune system due to tumor cell lysis as suggested by the clinical complete response to vemurafenib. The correlate of the findings in the SC mts with the lung mts could not be performed to determine if a similar immune reaction was taking place. It is nevertheless remarkable that the patient achieved a complete response with vemurafenib for more than 2&#8201;years, although the relationship between this response and the immune reaction may not be ascertained.</p><p>In line with our findings, Valmori et al. reported a functional and structural longitudinal analysis of the TCR of circulating CD8 T cells specific for the HLA-A2-restricted immunodominant epitope from the melanocyte differentiation Ag Melan-A in a melanoma patient who developed a vigorous and sustained Ag-specific T cell response following vaccination with the corresponding synthetic peptide. Some of these T cell clones were also identified at a metastatic tumor site, concluding that vaccine stimulation leads to the selection of high-avidity T cell clones of increased tumor reactivity that independently evolve within oligoclonal populations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Also, Carreno et al. reported that immunization with a dendritic cell-based personalized vaccine targeting neoantigens and gp100 peptides in three melanoma patients, promoted a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell receptor repertoire in terms of both TCRV&#946; usage and clonal composition. In pre-vaccination CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, as few as one and as many as 10 unique TCR&#946; clonotypes per neoantigen were identified. Vaccination increased the frequency of most existing pre-vaccine TCR&#946; clonotypes and revealed new clonotypes for all neoantigens tested. For both dominant and subdominant neoantigens, the TCR&#946; repertoire was increased significantly after vaccination (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Integral analysis of a non-microdissected metastatic melanoma tissue allowed us to carry out an exploratory search for expression of genes related to tumor biology and to the presence of immune populations infiltrating the tumor. Immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq results suggest that immunization with CSF-470 vaccine has triggered T-cell priming, as seen by brisk tumor immune infiltration. Other inhibitory immune pathways might be activated, as suggested by the abundance of B7-H3 and galectin 1 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), galectin 3 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and galectin 9 transcripts (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Also, Tim-3 and LAG-3 transcripts were detected; expression of these exhaustion molecules was previously reported in tumor-reactive infiltrating lymphocytes following PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICKB) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Only a low proportion of TIL expressed PD-1, probably preexisting Ag-experienced T cells, some of them in contact with tumor dying cells. Low levels of PD-1<sup>+</sup> expression found in TIL can be due to the fact that PD-1 is transiently expressed in T cells activation by Ags (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Since high PD-1 expression levels are achieved in chronic microenvironments, probably this inflamed tumor was removed before the establishment of local immune escape mechanisms driven by chronic tumor Ag exposure (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Also, high levels of LADH were detected, indicative of a highly proliferative tumor, supported by Ki-67<sup>+</sup> PI and activation of MAPK pathway through BRAF mutation. Along with this line, a recent work on a cohort of metastatic CM patients reported that response to PD-1 ICKB was better predicted when integrating T cell invigoration to tumor burden. Many TCR&#946; clones detected in pre-treatment TIL were also detected in blood only after treatment thus supporting the induction of an immune response. The clinical outcome was better predicted when the ratio of re-activated exhausted T cells to tumor burden was taken into account (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>This is the first report of the TCR&#946; repertoire from a CM patient immunized with the CSF-470 vaccine. The changes observed in peripheral immune populations as well as in the tumor compartment after immunization suggest that the vaccine can induce an antitumor adaptive immune repertoire that can reach tumor lesions and persist in blood for at least 2&#8201;years.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The CASVAC-0401 study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the &#8220;Ethics Committee of the Instituto M&#233;dico Especializado Alexander Fleming&#8221; with written informed consent from all subjects.
