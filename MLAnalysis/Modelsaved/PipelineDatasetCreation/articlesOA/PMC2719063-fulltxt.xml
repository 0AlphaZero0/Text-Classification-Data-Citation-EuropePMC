Given differential expression of these and other molecules involved in cell migration, it was of interest to determine whether loss of the TCR signal due to inactivation of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> expression impacted Treg cell migration and hence the distribution of Treg cells in the body. To address this, we examined the representation of cells that had lost p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> (due to inactivation of one copy of the <italic>Lck</italic> gene by <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>; the other allele being congenitally null) in various tissues, and compared this to the representation of cells in other mice that had acquired YFP expression (due to <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>-dependent recombination of one copy of the <italic>ROSA26</italic> YFP reporter allele). Expression of YFP was expected to be without significant consequence for Treg cells and should not impact their distribution in the body. Thus the frequency of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells was a useful reference point against which to look for effects of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> deficiency.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Treg cells lacking p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> were more abundant in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. This was consistent with the fact that loss of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> was associated with high expression of CD62L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and a lack of upregulation of molecules such as CD103, CXCR3, the &#946;1 integrin, Tiam1, RGS9 and CCR6, which are all of significance for emigration to tissues or retention in them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figure 7AB</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006580.s003">Table S1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0006580-Kleinewietfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006580-Agenes1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006580-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Much more strikingly, we noted a large decrease in the representation of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>-deficient Treg cells (relative to p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>-expressing Treg cells) in the peritoneal cavity in particular, although a less pronounced effect was evident in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).

Unlike Treg cells (and with the exception of CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peritoneal cavity) there was no apparent selection for retention of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> function in this population. Like Treg cells, however, proliferating cells were significantly underrepresented among the CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells that had undergone recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g004">Figures 4B and C</xref>) suggesting that their increased numbers could not be explained by a shorter cell cycle.

This was initially apparent from studies involving the adoptive transfer of Treg cell-depleted na&#239;ve T cells into irradiated recipients <xref rid="pone.0006580-Powrie1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, or from the analysis of mice that received neonatal thymectomies <xref rid="pone.0006580-Powrie1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006580-Sakaguchi2" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. More recently, it has been made strikingly clear by the rapidly fatal disease that develops in genetically engineered mice that feature induced selective depletion of Treg cells <xref rid="pone.0006580-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Inactivation of TCR signaling in Treg cells should be expected to result in disease because even though Treg cells can develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g003">Figure 3</xref>) they cannot mediate antigen-directed suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Both Lck and Lck/Fyn mice were, however, free of obvious disease throughout a year-long observation period and we noted no increase in unexpected fatalities in the mutant groups relative to controls. Evidence that the mice were nonetheless undergoing immune responses due to impaired Treg cell function included mild lymphadenopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and increased frequencies of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD25<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These latter T cells lacked expression of activation markers, and were not actively proliferating, indicating that the immune responses that created them were not ongoing. The majority of them had undergone <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>-mediated inactivation of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> (data not shown) providing a straightforward explanation for why they were not acutely activated, and suggesting that they were the product of clonal expansion that was likely terminated at the point when OX40 was induced. CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cell numbers were not significantly elevated in the mutant mice, but we nonetheless detected an increase in the frequency of such cells that had undergone <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>-mediated recombination relative to what was observed in <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>/YFP mice (data not shown) again consistent with atypical activation due to impaired Treg cell function. Although the absence of disease in the mutant mice limited their usefulness for studying disease suppression by Treg cells, it was an obvious advantage for studying the Treg cell-intrinsic consequences of a loss of TCR signaling in the absence of complicating immunopathology.</p><p>Among the most notable consequences of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> inactivation in Treg cells there was a substantial change in the steady-state pattern of gene expression. This was immediately evident at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figures 7</xref> and 9) where the loss of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> function correlated with dramatic changes in the display of several molecules. Most notably, compared to control cells, there was upregulation of Ly-6C and downregulation of CD103, CD200, CCR6, CD5, CD71, GITR, CD5, CD44 and CTLA4. Consistent with decreased levels of surface and intracellular molecules that influence migration to tissues and high levels of surface CD62L, Treg cells that had lost p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> function were under-represented in tissues and the spleen, but were present in normal frequencies in the lymph nodes. Whereas gene expression and distribution in the body were abnormal in p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>-deficient Treg cells, we found no obvious defects in p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>-sufficient cells in the same mice. Thus, the changes observed were intrinsic to Treg cells that had undergone <italic>Ox40-cre</italic>-mediated recombination and were not the result of systemic effects.</p><p>Under normal conditions, Treg cells can be subdivided into those that have a &#8216;na&#239;ve-like&#8217; phenotype and those that have an &#8216;effector/memory&#8217; phenotype <xref rid="pone.0006580-Huehn1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Activation of the former causes at least some of them to differentiate into the latter and to mobilize from the lymph nodes to tissues and inflamed sites <xref rid="pone.0006580-Huehn1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The correlation we have described between changes in gene expression and redistribution of Treg cells lacking p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> function are entirely consistent with this and indicate that the mobilization of Treg cells to tissues is a dynamic process that is strongly dependent on persistent TCR stimulation.</p><p>A large fraction of genes showed similar changes in expression in both Treg cells and conventional T cells following p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These included genes that are well-characterized as being responsive to the TCR signal such as those encoding Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, CD81, CD83, CD200, ALCAM, RANKL, and Stra13. It also included genes for CD137, CD44, Tieg1 and NRP1, variation in the expression of which has been correlated with Treg cell function <xref rid="pone.0006580-Bruder1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0006580-Venuprasad1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Genes that were substantially affected in regulatory but not conventional T cells included those encoding Myosin-6, Egr-3, PD-1, Ptger2, Galnt14, Tox, RGS10, LIP1, Ly6f, Txk, and Tec. We noted that among an independently-derived list of Treg signature genes <xref rid="pone.0006580-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, approximately 20% were differentially expressed in the mutant Treg cells. While this indicates that a substantial part of the Treg phenotype (measured at the population level) is dependent on persistent TCR signaling, it also shows that perhaps the majority of the Treg gene expression pattern is independent of this. In particular, we found that although there was a modest reduction in FoxP3 transcript levels, this decrease was not readily apparent by intracellular staining for FoxP3 protein. Thus, sustained FoxP3 expression in Treg cells, like that of many other Treg signature genes, was relatively insensitive to loss of the TCR signal.</p><p>Two of the more striking consequences of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> inactivation in Treg cells were the upregulation of Ly-6C and myosin-6 expression. The former is a cell surface molecule of unclear function that has the capacity to influence lymphocyte homing, while the latter is an actin-based motor with unusual properties <xref rid="pone.0006580-Hanninen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006580-Sweeney1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Upregulation of both molecules was initially detected in the microarray analysis, but was subsequently confirmed by FACS and real-time RT-PCR respectively. Although the significance of the upregulation of these genes in the mutant Treg cells remains to be established, it is possible that monitoring their expression (and that of other genes identified in this study) could be exploited as a means to identify cells in nonmutant populations of Treg cells that are experiencing less TCR signaling than other cells in the same populations. Such a discrimination might reveal unexpected relationships between self-responses and Treg cell function.</p><p>In almost all of the circumstances we examined, the absence of p59<italic><sup>Fyn</sup></italic> had no evident additive effect to the inactivation of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>. Thus, Treg cells were present at the same average frequency in all locations in both Lck and Lck/Fyn mice, and their cell surface phenotype was indistinguishable in both cases. The only difference we noted between the two types of mice was in the reduced frequency of memory phenotype CD25<sup>&#8722;</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lymph nodes of Lck/Fyn compared to Lck mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This decrease was associated with an increased apparent selection against cells with loss of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006580-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> and p59<italic><sup>Fyn</sup></italic> have partially overlapping functions at the CD4<sup>&#8722;</sup>CD8<sup>&#8722;</sup> double-negative stage of development in the thymus <xref rid="pone.0006580-Groves1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0006580-vanOers1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. They also both positively regulate Erk activation in na&#239;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to TCR ligation <xref rid="pone.0006580-Lovatt1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref> and they are at least partially redundant in regulating na&#239;ve T cell survival <xref rid="pone.0006580-Seddon1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Nonetheless, they phosphorylate distinct substrates and there is evidence that p59<italic><sup>Fyn</sup></italic> may be more important for attenuation of T cell signaling than for its propagation particularly in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0006580-Filby1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Thus, the absence of a more profound consequence of the double deficiency is not unexpected given the primacy of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> in positive regulation of TCR signaling.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown here that inactivation of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> &#8211; and thus the TCR signal &#8211; incapacitates Treg cells and results in changes in their gene expression program. Mutant Treg cells distribute themselves abnormally in the body and although they do not proliferate, they nonetheless are capable of long-term survival. The results make clear aspects of the phenotype of Treg cells that are directly dependent on the TCR signal, while also revealing the utility of the <italic>Ox40-cre</italic> allele for conditional mutagenesis in the Treg lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experiments involving animals were performed according to protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mice</title><p>
<italic>Ox40-cre</italic> mice were generated by gene targeting and contain an open reading frame encoding the cre recombinase inserted into exon 3 of the <italic>Ox40</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0006580-Klinger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The neomycin resistance gene used for selection of ES cells was removed by Flp recombination in the germline. The <italic>Ox40-cre</italic> locus expresses Cre in place of OX40; this study employed mice that were heterozygous for the <italic>cre</italic> allele and demonstrated haploid expression of OX40 from a wild-type <italic>Ox40</italic> allele. Heterozygous levels of OX40 are not associated with immunological defects <xref rid="pone.0006580-Pippig1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. ROSA26-<italic>loxP-</italic>Stop-<italic>loxP</italic>-YFP mice were kindly provided by Dr. F. Costantini (Columbia University, New York, NY). The conditional null allele of the <italic>Lck</italic> gene has <italic>loxP</italic> sites upstream of the translation initiation codon in exon 1 and downstream of exon 3, and was also generated by gene targeting in ES cells (Benjamin <italic>et al.</italic> in preparation). Through use of a cryptic mRNA splice site, the Cre-recombined form of this allele allows for translation of a truncated form of p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic> lacking the amino-terminal myristylation sequence, the CD4/CD8-interaction domain and the epitope recognized by the 1F6 monoclonal antibody. This truncated form of the protein is generated from thymic transcripts that derive from the proximal promoter of the <italic>Lck</italic> gene, but not from peripheral T cell transcripts deriving from the distal promoter. Mice homozygous for the Cre-recombined <italic>Lck</italic> allele manifest a phenotype that is identical to those of other p56<italic><sup>Lck</sup></italic>-deficient mice <xref rid="pone.0006580-Molina1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> showing that the truncated thymus-expressed protein is not functional, and thus the unrecombined allele can be used as a conditional null allele (Benjamin <italic>et al.</italic>, in preparation).
