In mice, experimental inflammation during embryonic development impairs behavioral and cognitive performances in adulthood. Synaptic dysfunctions may be at the origin of cognitive impairments, however the link between prenatal inflammation and synaptic defects remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we show that prenatal alteration of microglial function, including inflammation, induces delayed synaptic dysfunction in the adult. DAP12 is a microglial signaling protein expressed around birth, mutations of which in the human induces the Nasu-Hakola disease, characterized by early dementia. We presently report that synaptic excitatory currents in mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the DAP12 gene (DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice) display enhanced relative contribution of AMPA. Furthermore, neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups cultured without microglia develop similar synaptic alterations, suggesting that a prenatal dysfunction of microglia may impact synaptic function in the adult. As we observed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> microglia overexpress genes for IL1&#946;, IL6 and NOS2, which are inflammatory proteins, we analyzed the impact of a pharmacologically-induced prenatal inflammation on synaptic function. Maternal injection of lipopolysaccharides induced activation of microglia at birth and alteration of glutamatergic synapses in the adult offspring. Finally, neurons cultured from neonates born to inflamed mothers and cultured without microglia also displayed altered neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Our results demonstrate that prenatal inflammation is sufficient to induce synaptic alterations with delay.

These public health studies are supported by experimental data in rodents showing that maternal inflammation during fetal development impairs the behavior and social interactions of the adult offspring <xref rid="pone.0002595-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002595-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The mechanisms that link a transient prenatal inflammation with delayed impairment of neuronal functions have begun to be investigated at the cellular and molecular levels. The symptoms detected in the offspring after injection of inflammatory or infectious agents into pregnant dams are due to the inflammatory response itself, rather than to chemicals, bacteria, or viruses <xref rid="pone.0002595-Patterson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently, in a model mimicking a maternal viral infection, the behavioral alterations in the progeny were prevented by systemic injection of blocking antibodies against interleukin-6 <xref rid="pone.0002595-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This reinforces the hypothesis that the deleterious effects arise from the reaction of the immune system, rather that from the inflammatory agent itself. Moreover, several groups have found modifications of protein and mRNA levels of various cytokines and neurotrophic factors in the offspring <xref rid="pone.0002595-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002595-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, suggesting that the immune system of the embryos also contributes to inflammation. The role of microglia in this process has been little addressed <xref rid="pone.0002595-Jonakait1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Some cellular bases for impaired brain functions in adult offspring following a prenatal infection have been proposed. For instance, neurogenesis and apoptosis are altered in the adult offspring <xref rid="pone.0002595-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and morphological damages have been reported <xref rid="pone.0002595-Fatemi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Golan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, whereas it is now accepted that synaptic dysfunctions are responsible for the cognitive impairments observed in psychiatric disorders or neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0002595-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the structure and function of synapses following embryonic inflammation have not yet been investigated. We previously reported a link between immune system impairment and synaptic dysfunction, after having found an enhanced synaptic plasticity and an altered composition of synaptic AMPA receptors in mice mutated on a microglial gene <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These mice, DAP12<sup>KI</sup> (previously referred to as K&#916;75 mice <xref rid="pone.0002595-Tomasello1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) carry a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding DAP12, a 12 kD transmembrane signaling adaptor for a family of innate immunoreceptors. In the immune system, DAP12 regulates the activation of peritoneal or bone-marrow-derived macrophages <xref rid="pone.0002595-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002595-Tomasello2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the brain, DAP12 is transiently expressed by developing microglia <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and its expression can be reinduced in adult upon pathological conditions <xref rid="pone.0002595-Zujovic1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0002595-Langmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In culture, DAP12 also controls the phagocytic activity of microglia and the inflammatory response following neuronal death <xref rid="pone.0002595-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In humans, DAP12 mutations induce Nasu-Hakola disease (OMIM 221770), characterized by early dementia without any apparent neuronal damage <xref rid="pone.0002595-Paloneva1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Microglia are the instrumental cells of brain inflammation, therefore we investigated here the relationship between prenatal activation of microglia and alteration of synaptic function. We first demonstrated that the ratio between AMPA and NMDA receptor (AMPAR, NMDAR) currents is increased in adult DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, as compared to wild-type (WT). Then, by analyzing pure neuronal cultures from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups, we investigated the impact of the prenatal period in inducing late synaptic defects. Finally, as we observed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> animals displayed a transient microglial activation at birth, we compared their synaptic phenotype with the one of WT animals having experienced a pharmacologically-induced inflammation during their fetal development. We conclude from both genetical and pharmacological models that prenatal activation of microglia has a delayed impact on synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutation of the microglial protein DAP12 enhances relative AMPAR contribution to glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus</title><p>We previously reported that in the synapses of the Schaffer collaterals onto CA1 pyramidal neurons of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, the NMDA receptors (NMDARs) were more sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil, and the AMPARs were more permeable to calcium, as compared with WT mice <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Noteworthy, in synapses formed by dentate gyrus granule cells onto interneurons, it has been shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs and high content of NR2B in NMDAR result in an enhanced contribution of AMPAR to the glutamatergic response, with high ratio of AMPAR- versus NMDAR-evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) <xref rid="pone.0002595-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, in order to further understand the consequence of DAP12 mutation on synaptic function, we have now addressed the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR EPSCs in the Schaffer collateral synapses formed onto CA1 pyramidal neurons in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice. In WT mice, the ratio of AMPAR- over NMDAR-mediated currents was 0.23&#177;0.05 (n&#8202;=&#8202;9), while in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, this ratio was enhanced &#8764;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g001">Fig 1A</xref>; DAP12<sup>KI</sup>: 0.45&#177;0.08; n&#8202;=&#8202;10; p&lt;0.03). Thus, the relative contribution of AMPAR vs. NMDAR to glutamatergic currents is increased in the hippocampus of mutant mice. With electron microscopy analysis, we found that the synaptic density was unchanged in the hippocampus of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s001">Fig S1B</xref>), but the density of perforated synapses was significantly increased in the stratum radiatum of their CA1 area (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s001">Fig S1CD</xref>). This is consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> hippocampus, since perforated synapses are more enriched in AMPARs than in NMDARs <xref rid="pone.0002595-Ganeshina1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0002595-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002595.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>DAP12 mutation induces an increased ratio of AMPAR vs. NMDAR currents in adult hippocampal slices, whereas DAP12 is expressed only by microglia around birth.</title><p>(A) Ratio of AMPAR vs. NMDAR currents in hippocampal slices.

DAP12 mutation impacts glutamatergic transmission in the adult, but we previously demonstrated that it ceases to be expressed in the hippocampus at this age <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To solve this paradox, we examined more precisely the expression pattern of DAP12 in developing hippocampus of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). At E17, microglia were sparse and mostly ameboid. A majority displayed DAP12 immunoreactivity, albeit at low level. At P0, the density of microglia increased, and most displayed a bright immunostaining for DAP12. Between P0 and P3, the microglia became ramified and the fraction of DAP12-expressing microglia decreased. At P7, microglia were mostly ramified, and few DAP12-positive microglia were detected. Given that DAP12 is mainly expressed before P3 and that glutamatergic synapses are generated post-natally <xref rid="pone.0002595-Steward1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, we hypothesized that microglial dysfunction induced by DAP12 mutation has impacted the prenatal development of neurons with delayed consequences on synaptic function. To test this hypothesis, we cultured neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> and WT littermate P0 pups in the presence of AraC, so as to eliminate microglia. Neurons were grown for at least two weeks in culture to allow maturation of glutamatergic synapses <xref rid="pone.0002595-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. At that point, neuronal cultures were more than 99% pure (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s002">Fig S2</xref>). Fluorometric calcium imaging was used to monitor neuronal activity. Since spontaneous activity was moderate in hippocampal cultures, all recordings were performed in the presence of the potassium channel blocker 4AP (50 &#181;M) to increase the global network activity. Under these conditions, neurons cultured from WT and DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 displayed similar activity (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuation in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> cultures: 115&#177;4% of WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Yet, in the presence of 6-cyano-7 nitroquinoxline-2 (CNQX), an AMPAR antagonist, neuronal activity was significantly lower in neurons cultured from mutant as compared with WT littermates (coefficient of variation of calcium fluctuations in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> cultures: 66&#177;2% of WT; n&gt;600; p&lt;0,0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results are consistent with the enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. They indicate that the contribution of AMPARs to neuronal activity is increased in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> neurons cultured in the absence of microglia. This increased contribution of AMPAR may possibly reflect an increased proportion of excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors. To test this, glutamatergic synapses and AMPAR were identified by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) and by GluR1 immunoreactivities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Fig 2C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows that the proportion of excitatory synapses colocalized with GluR1-positive puncta was significantly increased in cultures from mutant pups as compared with WT pups (n&gt;160; p&lt;0.0001). In conclusion, neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups cultured in the absence of microglia exhibit an enhanced relative contribution of AMPAR to excitatory transmission, which is compatible with the synaptic phenotype observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. This demonstrates that microglial alteration due to DAP12 loss-of-function impacts neurons before birth, with delayed effects on synaptic function.</p><fig id="pone-0002595-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002595.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> P0 pups cultured without microglia develop synaptic alterations.</title><p>(A) Coefficients of variation (CV, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), in basal conditions, of the fluctuations of intracellular calcium concentration, in neurons cultured from WT and DAP12<sup>KI</sup> animals.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, microglial density was increased in the hippocampus of P0 born to LPS-injected dams (158&#177;18% of control; n&#8202;=&#8202;37 pairs of slices; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g004">Fig 4AB</xref>). This increase was comparable with the one observed in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> pups (see above). We next evaluated the consequence of such prenatal inflammation on glutamatergic transmission. To do so, we first measured the ratio of AMPAR versus NMDAR EPSCs in an adult born to inflamed mother. As in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, the relative contribution of AMPAR to evoked EPSCs was enhanced in hippocampal slices taken from adult mice that had been subjected to fetal inflammation (AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio: Control: 0.18&#177;0.02 (n&#8202;=&#8202;9); LPS-treated mice: 0.23&#177;0.01 (n&#8202;=&#8202;10); p&lt;0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002595-g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002595-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002595.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Maternal exposure to LPS induces microglial activation at birth and synaptic alterations in the adult offspring.</title><p>(A) F4/80 labeling of microglia (arrows) in the hippocampus of P0 born from control (CTL) or LPS-injected dams (matLPS).

In particular, we showed that these synapses displayed a somehow immature phenotype, in which the NMDARs were more sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil, and the AMPARs more permeable to calcium as compared with WT mice <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. We have now observed that in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, these synapses also display a higher ratio of AMPAR versus NMDAR EPSC. Such a correlation between AMPAR/NMDAR composition and properties and AMPAR/NMDAR currents ratio has been reported in another kind of synapses <xref rid="pone.0002595-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice, the increased AMPAR to NMDAR currents ratio may also synergistically result from the increased density of perforated synapses that we measured, since these synapses are especially enriched with AMPARs <xref rid="pone.0002595-Ganeshina1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Ganeshina2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This increased density was restricted to the medial segment of the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons and may contribute to the EPSCs that we monitored <xref rid="pone.0002595-Megias1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Spruston1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>We previously proposed that the enhanced LTP in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice may be due to a larger fraction of silent, AMPAR-less, synapses in mutant mice. Such hypothesis was based on biochemical analysis of post-synaptic densities (PSD) that showed a decreased content of AMPAR in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> mice brain as compared with WT. We did not observe this decrease in our present analysis of hippocampal cultures and hippocampal synapses morphology. This apparent discrepancy probably results from the fact that in order to get an adequate amount of material, the prior PSD analysis had been performed on whole cortex extracts, and this may have occluded subtle modifications of synaptic AMPARs restricted to the more specific regions under investigation in our current study. Moreover, recent reports in the literature have demonstrated that switching synaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs with those containing NR2A, dramatically reduces LTP <xref rid="pone.0002595-Barria1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Indeed, in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> hippocampus, NMDAR were sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil <xref rid="pone.0002595-Roumier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Thus, the enhanced LTP previously observed in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> hippocampus may be the consequence of the modifications of NMDARs. In order to get an insight into the mechanism linking DAP12 loss-of-function and neuronal phenotype, we characterized the microglial alterations induced by the mutation. We showed that DAP12<sup>KI</sup> microglia cultured from P0 pups express higher levels of inflammatory markers such as NOS-2, IL1&#946;, and IL6, as compared with their WT counterparts. The inflammatory status of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> was further confirmed by the detection of a transient microgliosis in new-born, but not in adult mice brains. It has recently been demonstrated that in peripheral macrophages, DAP12 signaling is activator or inhibitor depending on the inflammatory context <xref rid="pone.0002595-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Hamerman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It has been proposed that upon a strong inflammatory stimulus such as a high level of LPS, DAP12 participates in activatory pathways, whereas at a low level of LPS, DAP12 may preferentially recruit inhibitory mediators <xref rid="pone.0002595-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our data suggest that in the developing brain, DAP12 is a down-regulator of microglial activation.</p><p>Neurons cultured from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> or inflamed P0 pups that were grown in a microglia-free and non-inflammatory environment display altered synaptic function. This demonstrates that prenatal inflammation suffices to alter synaptic function. However, this does not exclude the possibility that prenatal inflammation also has long-lasting effects on tissue and secondarily impacts neuronal or synaptic dysfunction. For instance, adult mice born to inflamed mother can display histological alterations <xref rid="pone.0002595-Fatemi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Golan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or impaired neurogenesis <xref rid="pone.0002595-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which may result in disturbance of neurotransmission. Similarly, old DAP12-deficient mice display hypomyelinosis in thalamus <xref rid="pone.0002595-Kaifu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002595-Nataf1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Such deficiencies demonstrate persistent changes that we have not addressed in the present study. Together with white matter alteration, a synaptic degeneration has been described in the thalamus of DAP12-deficient mice, based on abnormal vesicles accumulations observed by electron microscopy <xref rid="pone.0002595-Kaifu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We did not detect morphological alterations of synapses in the hippocampus of DAP12<sup>KI</sup> by electron microscopy (supplementary data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002595.s001">Fig S1 A</xref>). Such a difference between the two studies may be due to differences in age, in the genetic background of the mice, or in the brain regions studied. Alternatively, the difference may arise from the fact that the vesicle accumulations, described as being a sign of synaptic degeneration <xref rid="pone.0002595-Kaifu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, were not located in synapses as defined by the apposition of vesicles, presynaptic dense projections, synaptic cleft, and post-synaptic density <xref rid="pone.0002595-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Rather, these accumulations may correspond to features that have been already described and are unrelated to synaptic dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0002595-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>Prenatal inflammation is known to differentially impact adult neuronal functions, depending on the inflammation-inducing protocol <xref rid="pone.0002595-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In our study, we found that neurons cultured from maternally-inflamed pups display enhanced basal neuronal activity as compared with control. In contrast, basal activity was identical in neurons from DAP12<sup>KI</sup> and WT pups. This shows that the genetical and pharmacological inductions of prenatal microglial activation induce similar but not identical synaptic phenotypes. Such a difference may be due to TNF&#945;, whose mRNA is not upregulated in DAP12<sup>KI</sup> microglia, but which is a hallmark of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0002595-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>We have now shown that activation of microglia impacts neurons prenatally, with a delayed effect on their synaptic function. Deferred alteration of synaptic function depending on prenatal development has already been observed. For example, synaptic activity can be recorded on neurons from E18 rat hippocampus cultured for two weeks, whereas it is barely detected when neurons are cultured from E16 embryos <xref rid="pone.0002595-VicarioAbejon1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.
