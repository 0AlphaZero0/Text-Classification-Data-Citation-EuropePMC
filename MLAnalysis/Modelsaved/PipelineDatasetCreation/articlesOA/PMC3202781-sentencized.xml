<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dothistromin toxin is produced by fungal pine pathogens in the genus Dothistroma (class Dothideomycetes) and is responsible for the characteristic red banding seen in infected needles [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A taxonomic revision in 2004 split the pathogen Dothistroma pini into two new species: D. septosporum, that has a worldwide distribution, and D. pini that appears to be confined to a few regions in the Northern hemisphere [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In recent years the prevalence and severity of this disease has increased, with epidemics in Canada and Europe associated with climate change [4,5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dothistromin is a difuroanthraquinone toxin with a polyketide backbone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its structure is similar to that of versicolorin B, a precursor of aflatoxin and sterigmatocystin [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dothistromin is toxic not only to pine tissue, but also to a wide range of other eukaryotes and bacteria [7,8], hence is considered a non-host-selective toxin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The precise mode of action is not known but dothistromin can be reductively activated leading to the formation of the reactive oxygen species superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Dothistromin was once suspected to have a major role in needle blight disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However dothistromin-deficient mutants of D. septosporum made by disruption of the dothistromin polyketide synthase gene (pksA) were pathogenic to Pinus radiata, showing that dothistromin is not required for disease development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Instead the toxin may have a role in competition against other microorganisms in the needle environment, a hypothesis that is supported by competition studies in vitro [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>But given that dothistromin is highly toxic to a wide range of fungal species, the question arises of how D. septosporum is able to tolerate its own toxin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Many fungal toxin gene clusters include toxin transporter genes and some of these have been shown to have roles in virulence and/or self-protection against the toxins [11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Transporters of the non-host-selective toxin cercosporin have been implicated in virulence, including the CFP transporter in Cercospora kikuchii [13] and CTB4 in Cercospora nicotianae [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Disruption of genes encoding these transporters significantly lowered the amount of cercosporin produced in each case, suggesting a role in regulation of cercosporin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, whilst the CFP mutants were sensitive to exogenously supplied cercosporin the CTB4 mutants showed normal levels of resistance [13,14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Disruption of some transporter genes appears to have no effect on either production or efflux of the associated toxin, such as the AflT transporter encoded in the aflatoxin gene cluster [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is likely that there is redundancy with other transporters able to complement the disruption mutations [12,16,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Genes associated with dothistromin biosynthesis were identified on the basis of their similarity to aflatoxin genes [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The dotA gene was the first to be identified, and encodes a ketoreductase with 80% amino acid identity to the aflatoxin Ver-1 (AflM) in Aspergillus parasiticus. Other genes found alongside dotA include dotC that encodes a putative dothistromin transporter in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), with 14 transmembrane domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>DotC is similar in sequence to MFS proteins in other species in the Dothideomycetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It has 53% amino acid identity with both the Fnx1 multidrug resistance protein of Phytophthora tritici-repens (XP_001938334) and a hypothetical protein (SNOG_04383) in Phaeosphaeria nodorum (XP_001794802). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast there is less than 32% amino acid identity to Aspergillus parasiticus AflT (AAS66020.1), Cercospora kikuchii CFP (AAC78076) and Cercospora nicotianae CTB4 (ABK64181.1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The aim of this investigation was to analyse the function of DotC to determine if it has a role in tolerance, efflux and/or biosynthesis of dothistromin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Mutants with a targeted disruption of dotC, or a complemented strain with multiple copies of dotC, were studied along with strains expressing DotC-GFP or DotA-GFP fusion proteins in order to determine the location and role of DotC in D. septosporum. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Two out of 26 hygromcyin resistant colonies (named FJT15 and FJT16) showed correct targeted replacement of the dotC gene when tested by PCR (results not shown) and Southern blotting (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Other transformants had ectopic integration of the construct or vector integration only in the 3' region of dotC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The Southern blot also confirmed that there is only one copy of dotC in the D. septosporum genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The dotC mutant FJT15 was subsequently transformed with a complementation construct (pR282) to restore dotC function and integration of the construct in the complemented strain FJT93 was confirmed by PCR (results not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The copy number of dotC in the complemented strain was estimated by real-time PCR to be 10 copies, making FJT93 a DotC-overproducing strain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen between sporulation of the dotC mutants FJT15 (1.48 ± 0.32 ± 106 spores/mL; P = 0.725) and FJT16 (1.17 ± 0.29 ± 106 spores/mL; P = 0.706) compared to the wild type NZE10 (1.32 ± 0.29 ± 106 spores/mL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Likewise the radial growth rate of the dotC mutants was similar to that of the wild type with FJT15 (0.60 ± 0.03 mm/day; P = 0.092) and FJT16 (0.58 ± 0.02 mm/day; P = 0.182) not significantly different from the wild type (0.54 ± 0.02 mm/day). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The dotC-complemented strain FJT93 grew slightly slower than the wild-type but in these experiments the difference was not significant (0.50 ± 0.02 mm/day; P = 0.119). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To determine if DotC confers a protective effect against exogenously supplied toxin, the ability of dotC mutants to grow in the presence of dothistromin was investigated (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Although there was some variability in growth rates, as often seen with D. septosporum, none of the strains appeared to be strongly inhibited by even the highest concentration of dothistromin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Colonies on 100 μM dothistromin grew to &gt;96% of the diameter of colonies grown without dothistromin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This concentration of dothistromin is in excess of levels usually secreted by the strains (5-11 μM for NZE10 and 20-40 μM secreted by FJT93). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Hence it appears that DotC is not required for resistance to dothistromin in D. septosporum. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the dotC disruption mutants (FJT15 and FJT16) secreted only 4-7% of the amount of dothistromin secreted by the wild type NZE10 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The amounts of dothistromin in the mycelia were also lower in these mutants than the wild-type, but these differences were not significant, possibly due to large variation between replicates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the lower levels of secreted dothistromin in the dotC mutants were a direct consequence of overall lower levels of dothistromin production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The amounts of dothistromin produced by the mutants (mycelium and broth combined) were only 8.5% and 4.4% of wild type levels for the FJT15 and FJT16 mutants respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>However the right-hand column in Table 2 suggests a small, but not significant, difference in the percentage of dothistromin secreted: in the wild type over 90% of all dothistromin was secreted whilst in the dotC knockout mutants only 80-83% was secreted. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>DotC is a close match to MFS proteins, with no evidence for a DNA binding domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A dramatic reduction in toxin production was also seen in CFP mutants of Cercospora kikuchii, with less than 5% of wild type levels of cercosporin produced [13], and also to CTB4 and ATR1 mutants of C. nicotianae with less than 35% and 25% of wild type cercosporin respectively [14,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The observation that some dothistromin was still secreted in the dotC mutants suggests that other transporters are involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Multiple transporters with overlapping roles have been reported in several fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>For example in C. nicotianae the ABC transporter ATR1 was shown to have a major role in cercosporin production and, along with another MFS transporter CnCFP, contributed to auto-resistance to cercosporin [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The dotC complemented mutant (FJT93) produced and secreted very high levels of dothistromin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The secreted levels were five-fold higher than those seen with the wild-type, but the variability between replicates was high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The amount of dothistromin secreted from FJT93 was significantly higher than the combined results from wild type strains NZE7 and NZE10 (P = 0.0037) but not compared to NZE10 alone (P = 0.0516). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The levels of non-secreted dothistromin remaining in the mycelium were extremely high in FJT93: more than 30-fold higher than the wild type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>It appears there was a dramatic increase in dothistromin biosynthesis in FJT93 and that the cells were unable to secrete the dothistromin as quickly as it was being made: almost 40% of the total amount of dothistromin remained in the mycelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Since FJT93 only showed a slightly slower growth rate compared to the wild type (significant in only one of two trials) the high intracellular levels of dothistromin did not appear to be toxic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>These high levels of toxin further suggest that dothistromin accumulation in the cell is not a primary feedback regulator of dothistromin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>As expected, the dotC disruption mutants FJT15 &amp; 16 showed no dotC expression above background, as they lacked this single-copy gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Expression of the dotA dothistromin biosynthetic gene was significantly reduced in the dotC mutants, to around 18-26% of levels in wild type strains (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>It therefore seems likely that the lower levels of dothistromin made by the mutants are at least partly due to lower levels of biosynthetic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Both FJT15 and FJT16 also showed different tubA (constitutive control) expression levels compared to the wild type, but one had a higher and one a lower level of tubA so no consistent effects were noted. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However the increased gene expression is consistent with a role for DotC in regulating dothistromin biosynthesis and with the decline in dothistromin production seen in the dotC disruption mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Further to this, high intracellular concentrations of dothistromin in a strain that appears to make an excess of DotC adds support to the hypothesis that DotC is not the major efflux pump for dothistromin and suggests that there are other factors besides DotC limiting secretion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>We propose the hypothesis that mid to late stages of dothistromin biosynthesis occur in vacuoles as proposed for aflatoxin biosynthesis [21] and that this enables D. septosporum to tolerate high intracellular toxin levels as seen in the over-expressing strain FJT93. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Whether DotC has a role in dothistromin efflux from the cell remains inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Firstly although mutants deficient in DotC secreted less dothistromin, and a slightly lower % of total dothistromin, than wild types, these results could have been due to overall lower levels of dothistromin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Secondly although DotC-GFP fusions suggested that DotC is located on the cell membrane, DotC does not appear to be the primary efflux transporter as dotC mutants can still secrete dothistromin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Furthermore a DotC-overproducing strain appeared unable to pump out the very high levels of dothistromin it produced, and had high intracellular toxin levels, suggesting rate limitation by other efflux systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In general, transcription of dothistromin genes and dothistromin production decreased in DotC-deficient mutants and increased in a DotC-overproducing strain, suggesting an important role for DotC in regulation of dothistromin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Cellular localization studies supported the hypothesis that dothistromin biosynthesis occurs in vacuoles or vesicles as previously suggested for aflatoxin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It is possible that compartmentalization of dothistromin provides D. septosporum with a mechanism of self-protection against its own toxin, and may be the key to understanding how efflux pumps can contribute to the regulation of toxin biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
