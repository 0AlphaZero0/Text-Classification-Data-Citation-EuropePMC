For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> FLS2 (<underline>Fl</underline>agellin <underline>S</underline>ensing 2) and EFR (<underline>E</underline>longation <underline>F</underline>actor Tu <underline>R</underline>eceptor) receptors recognize the flg22 peptide derived from bacterial flagellin and the elf18 peptide derived from elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu) protein, respectively (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Gomez &amp; Boller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>). The rice XA21 receptor recognizes the sulfated RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) derived from the RaxX protein produced by <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>) (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). XA21, EFR, and FLS2 all contain extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR), transmembrane, and intracellular non-RD (arginine-aspartic acid) kinase domains. These receptor domains are partially interchangeable. For example, the LRR domain from EFR can be fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of FLS2 to form a chimeric receptor that responds to elf18 treatments when transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 2010</xref>). The EFR LRR can be fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of XA21 to form a chimeric receptor that responds to elf18 treatment and confers partial resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic> in transgenic rice lines (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>The availability of rapid and reliable assays that measure markers characteristic of immune response activation can help facilitate investigations of innate immune signaling. For example, immune signaling studies of FLS2 and EFR in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have been aided by the availability of rapid and reliable assays (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Gomez &amp; Boller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Zipfel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, studies of the XA21-mediated immune response have been limited by the lack of rapid assays and well-characterized genetic markers. Typically, disease assessments are carried out by measuring lesions on rice leaves or by assessing bacterial populations from infected leaves (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Kauffman et al., 1973</xref>; <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study we aimed to establish a rapid and efficient assay to monitor the XA21-mediated immune response after bacterial infection. For this purpose, we employed the EFR:XA21:GFP chimera composed of the EFR extracellular domain and the XA21 transmembrane and intracellular kinase domains, tagged with green fluorescent protein (EFR:XA21:GFP) (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2015a</xref>). EFR:XA21:GFP transgenic rice plants are partially resistant to <italic>Xoo</italic> and detached EFR:XA21:GFP leaves respond to elf18 with stress-related gene induction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade activation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2015a</xref>). These results indicate that plants expressing the EFR:XA21:GFP chimeric protein are appropriate for studies to identify markers of resistance.</p><p>We used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify genes differentially regulated in elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP rice. We then assessed if differentially regulated genes (DRGs) in elf18 treated EFR:XA21:GFP rice leaves were up-regulated in <italic>Xoo</italic> infected rice leaves expressing full-length XA21, which are resistant to <italic>Xoo</italic>.

At the time of these experiments, the activator of XA21, RaxX, had not yet been identified (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore treated rice plants expressing the EFR:XA21:GFP chimera with elf18 to identify candidate marker genes because EFR:XA21:GFP rice are partially resistant to <italic>Xoo</italic> and respond to elf18 treatments as described above in the introduction. Our results show that even though the EFR:XA21:GFP-mediated response does not confer robust resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic> (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2015a</xref>), similar genes are up-regulated during both EFR:XA21:GFP- and Myc:XA21-mediated responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). Further studies are necessary to determine why the expression of EFR:XA21:GFP in rice does not confer robust resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic>.</p><p>We show that stress-related gene induction of <italic>PR10b</italic> in Myc:XA21 rice leaves is maintained in plants inoculated with PXO99A&#916;<italic>hrpA1</italic> mutant strains. These results suggest that RaxX expression, modification and secretion is not compromised by the &#916;<italic>hrpA1</italic> mutation. These results indicate that RaxX function is independent of type-III secretion mediated by <italic>hrpA1</italic>. It was previously reported that the <italic>raxSTAB</italic> operon, which encoded predicted components of a type-I secretion system, was required for the processing and secretion of the XA21 elicitor (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al., 2004</xref>). Our finding that RaxX function is independent of <italic>hrpA1</italic>-mediated type-III secretion is consistent with the hypothesis that RaxX is a type I-secreted molecule (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt et al., 2015</xref>) and may provide insight into the largely unknown biological function of RaxX.</p><p>The discovery of RaxX and the establishment of the detached leaf infection assay described here provide useful tools for studying XA21-mediated immunity. XA21 activation can be measured through ROS production and marker gene expression in detached leaves treated with the RaxX21-sY peptide (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Schwessinger et al., 2015b</xref>). One advantage of this approach is that researchers can study XA21-mediated immunity without working with <italic>Xoo</italic>. Instead, researchers can activate XA21-mediated immunity by treating leaves with RaxX21-sY peptide rather than <italic>Xoo</italic>. This strategy eliminates the need for select agent permits, which are costly and time-consuming. The assay described in this study now allows researchers to use <italic>Xoo</italic> infected plants to monitor XA21 activation by gene expression, which was previously only possible using peptide treatments. This provides the benefit of monitoring bacterial induced genes, such as <italic>Os8N3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). While we are not able to definitively assess resistance versus susceptibility to <italic>Xoo</italic> using this assay, we demonstrate that we can use gene expression to monitor an immune response specifically mediated by XA21.</p><p>The detached leaf infection assay can also be used for other studies of bacterial-rice interactions. For example, this system can be used to study rice immune responses conferred by different resistance genes or induced by different bacterial strains. For example, the detached leaf infection assay can be used to study the immune response conferred by other rice <italic>Xa</italic> genes (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Khan, Naeem &amp; Iqbal, 2014</xref>) that confer resistance to <italic>Xoo</italic> such as <italic>Xa3/Xa26</italic>, which also encodes a cell surface receptor kinase (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>).
