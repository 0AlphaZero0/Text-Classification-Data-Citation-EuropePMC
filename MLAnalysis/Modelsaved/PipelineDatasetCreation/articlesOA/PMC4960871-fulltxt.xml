Primary aim: to examine whether vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (100,000&#160;IU) rapidly raises serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L in asthmatic preschoolers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, preschool-aged children with asthma received 100,000&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (intervention) or placebo (control), followed by 400&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> daily for 6&#160;months. Serum 25OHD was measured at baseline, 10&#160;days, 3 and 6&#160;months. Outcomes included the group difference in 25OHD change from baseline at 3&#160;months (&#916;25OHD); the proportion of children with 25OHD &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L at 3&#160;months; the pattern in serum vitamin D over 6&#160;months; the proportion of children with hypercalciuria at any time point (safety); and group rates for oral corticosteroids. Continuous outcomes were analysed using generalised linear mixed models and group rate ratios of events per child were assessed using a Poisson distribution model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-two children were randomised (intervention:11; control:11) during winter. At 3&#160;months, the group difference in &#916;25OHD (7.2&#160;nmol/L; 95 % CI: -13.7, 28.1) was not significant; yet, 100&#160;% versus 54.5&#160;% (intervention versus control) had serum 25OHD &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L. There was a significant group difference in &#916;25OHD at 10&#160;days (110.3&#160;nmol/L; 95 % CI: 64.0, 156.6). One child in each group had transient hypercalciuria at 10&#160;days. Group oral corticosteroids rates were 0.82 and 1.18/child, intervention versus control (rate ratio&#8201;=&#8201;0.68; 95 % CI: 0.30, 1.62; non-significant).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Following 100,000&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, all children reached serum 25OHD &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L, compared with half who received placebo. Daily supplementation, sun exposure and insufficient power may explain the absence of a significant 3-month group difference in &#916;25OHD. No clinically important alterations in bone metabolism biomarkers occurred. Group oral corticosteroid rates will inform sample size calculations for the larger trial.

This is not surprising considering wheeze, the most common symptom associated with asthma in preschoolers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], affects up to 50&#160;% of children before age six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More than 80&#160;% of asthma exacerbations in children are triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. URTIs occur at a rate of up to eight per year in preschoolers with recurrent wheeze or asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the most common being rhinovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is therefore pertinent to explore preventive strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of viral-induced asthma exacerbations in preschool-aged children.</p><p>To date, pharmacological therapeutic avenues have predominantly been explored. Daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and pre-emptive high-dose ICS are both effective in reducing the frequency of moderate to severe exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Uncertainties about the diagnosis and worry about side effects have limited the uptake of both strategies by physicians and/or parents. In paediatric observational studies, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) has been inversely associated with asthma severity, ICS dose, and the number of exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids or health care utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as increased risk of viral URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In three placebo-controlled randomised trials of school-aged children with asthma, daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] or monthly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the rate of mild (requiring rescue short-acting &#946;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, SABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and moderate (requiring an acute care visit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] asthma exacerbations, with most exacerbations reportedly preceded by URTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although it has not yet been investigated in preschool-aged children with recurrent viral-induced exacerbations, vitamin D supplementation appears promising to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations. Moreover, the use of a large dose administered by a health care professional, as opposed to daily supplementation, is likely to rapidly increase serum 25OHD levels to the desired target and remove the issue of non-compliance associated with patient-administered supplementation.</p><p>The aim of this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate whether a single large dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> effectively raises serum 25OHD to levels considered sufficient for potential extra-skeletal benefits (&#8805;75&#160;nmol/L [&#8805;30&#160;ng/mL]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], in preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma, compared with placebo. Second, we aimed to assess the feasibility of recruitment, intervention, procedures, and follow-up, and obtain pilot efficacy and safety data to inform the design of a large RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted a 6-month randomised, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) supplementation in preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma. Patients were recruited in the asthma clinic, hospital wards, and emergency department of the Sainte-Justine University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada, during the winter months, November 2013 to February 2014. The study was approved by the Sainte-Justine University Health Centre Research Ethics Board (#3760) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01999907, November 2013).

At baseline, subjects received orally 2&#160;mL of either 50,000&#160;IU/mL vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or identical placebo (Euro-Pharm International Canada, Montreal, QC, Canada). The dose was administered by the nurse, followed by 30&#160;minutes of monitoring. The investigators initially believed it was unethical to not provide vitamin D to the control group, who were suspected to have low serum 25OHD levels at recruitment; thus, all participants, irrespective of group assignment, were provided with Pediavit D400 (Euro-Pharm International Canada, Montreal, QC, Canada) and instructed to take 1&#160;mL daily (400&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) during the study. Adherence was assessed by weighing the bottles before dispensation and at their return at each clinic visit.</p><p>Patient characteristics were documented at baseline, including skin type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and asthma control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Non-fasting blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, 10&#160;days (&#177;3&#160;days), 3 and 6&#160;months (&#177;0.5&#160;months). With the exception of baseline samples, which were analysed immediately, serum aliquots preserved for vitamin D analysis were stored at -80&#160;&#176;C for batch analysis at the end of the study to maintain blinding. Total 25OHD (comprised of 25OHD<sub>2</sub>, 25OHD<sub>3</sub> and 3-epimer-25OHD<sub>3</sub>) was analysed via tandem mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Safety biomarkers were analysed immediately using standard laboratory processes.</p><p>Within 2&#160;days of symptom onset (runny or congested nose, fever, or cough), parents collected a nasal secretion sample from the child&#8217;s nostril using a flocked mid-turbinate swab, which was then placed in a tube containing 1&#160;mL Universal Transport Medium (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). The swab was transported by courier for storage at -80&#160;&#176;C before polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] for 26 viruses (Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada).

Bone metabolism biomarkers provide preliminary data on the safety of the intervention, while the observed group rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids informs power calculations for the full-scale trial.</p><p>With approximately three-quarters of participants vitamin D-insufficient at baseline, 100,000&#160;IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was effective in rapidly raising total serum 25OHD by 10&#160;days and maintaining vitamin D sufficiency at 3&#160;months in 100&#160;% of the intervention group, compared to barely half of those assigned to the placebo. This rapid rise in serum 25OHD has previously been demonstrated in one infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and one adolescent trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], 15&#160;days following 100,000 and 200,000&#160;IU, respectively, of oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Concordant with a prior trial reporting 55&#160;% of those receiving 400&#160;IU daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> achieved 25OHD levels &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L (30&#160;ng/mL) at 3&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], our data suggest that, while daily 400&#160;IU in addition to current dietary intake (approximately 200&#160;IU) prevents the expected serum 25OHD decline in the fall and winter (with significant within-group increases at 3 and 6&#160;months in the control group), it is insufficient to achieve vitamin D levels &#8805;75&#160;nmol/L (30&#160;ng/mL) in control patients. Yet, our main endpoint, group difference in the change in total 25OHD from baseline to 3&#160;months, was not statistically significant. This non-separation of the groups was likely due to one, or a combination, of three main factors: (i) daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in the control group; (ii) increased opportunity for ultraviolet B exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as more than half of the 3-month visits occurred in the spring; and (iii) our small sample size. In future trials, we would recommend the dose of 100,000&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> be administered in early fall or winter, to pre-empt the expected seasonal decline in 25OHD and minimise the influence of sun exposure in spring and summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and removal of daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in the control group.</p><p>Although not powered to firmly conclude, our results contribute data supporting the safety of a dose of 100,000&#160;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in preschool-aged children with asthma; there were no cases of potentially toxic 25OHD levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or clinically significant changes in bone metabolism biomarkers. Of the five paediatric trials testing repeated oral doses of 100,000&#160;IU vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], all but one measured circulating 25OHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; just one trial reported two cases (0.3&#160;%) of 25OHD &gt;375&#160;nmol/L (150&#160;ng/mL) in a population of malnourished infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], but did not measure serum or urine bone metabolism biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], such that the clinical significance of the findings is unclear. Hence, only three of the five aforementioned trials provided additional safety data for a total of 15 infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and 47 school-aged children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Of these, one found ALP significantly decreased 9&#160;months after study initiation in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and another reported one transient hypercalciuria event in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; neither were clinically important alterations. Likewise, the few hypercalciuria events, documented in one subject of each group in our study, were transient. Occasional minor deviations from normal laboratory values were likely due to the non-fasting status of our patients, in contrast to a trial where subjects fasted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. While the administration of two spaced doses of 80,000&#8211;100,000&#160;IU vitamin D every winter is recommended for all preschool-aged children in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], the evidence supporting the safety profile of this approach is weak and thus requires confirmatory data to be adopted in practice in North America. In future trials, we recommend the documentation of circulating 25OHD and bone metabolism biomarkers, including fasting urinary calcium:creatinine, in all subjects, with greater power to contribute data regarding the safety of a high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> oral bolus.</p><p>Our trial also aimed to provide health event rates to inform sample size calculations for the subsequent large-scale trial. The observed trend towards a 32&#160;% reduction in the rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids with high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is promising, but is not statistically significant. In three placebo-controlled RCTs of school-aged children with asthma, vitamin D supplementation has significantly reduced the rate of mild (requiring only rescue &#946;<sub>2</sub>-agonists) to moderate (requiring emergency visits) asthma exacerbations by 64&#160;% (RR: 0.36) with 500&#160;IU/ day for 6&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], by 83&#160;% (RR: 0.17) with 1200&#160;IU/ day for 4&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and by 53&#160;% (RR: 0.47) with 60,000&#160;IU monthly for 6&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although the optimal delay between doses remains to be confirmed, repeat dosing in the context of a longer intervention period may be needed to increase the duration of vitamin D sufficiency, and thus maximise the likelihood of vitamin D supplementation benefit. Vitamin D may reduce asthma exacerbations via improving resistance to viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] (a main trigger of asthma exacerbations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], modulating the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], either directly or indirectly by improving response to corticosteroid maintenance medications, or relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The observed trend towards fewer exacerbations warrants further investigation in trials adequately powered to detect a statistically significant group difference in this important health outcome for children with asthma.</p><p>This study has several notable aspects, namely, dose administration by research personnel in the routine clinical setting, which achieved 100&#160;% compliance and avoided the potential non-compliance associated with self-administered daily supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Importantly, there was no clinically important change in dietary vitamin D intake over the 6-month period, indicating no evidence of Hawthorne bias; that is, participation in the study did not lead to higher dietary intake of vitamin D in either group. In addition, we used the gold-standard method, tandem mass spectrophotometry, to quantify serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, including epimer-D<sub>3</sub>. The documentation of several bone metabolism biomarkers offers preliminary data towards the safety of this supplementation dose.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations to this trial, namely, being underpowered for our specified primary outcome, which possibly impaired our ability to firmly conclude on our main outcome. However, we detected a statistically significant difference in the proportion of children with vitamin D sufficiency, our secondary outcome, from which our sample size was calculated. It is also possible that the period during which children maintained vitamin D sufficiency was not sufficient to allow the proposed effects of vitamin D to be observed; thus, a longer intervention, with repeat dosing, may be warranted. As the administration of daily 400&#160;IU in both groups probably prevented group separation, future studies could consider removal of daily supplementation in the control group alone to maximise group separation. Indeed, a recent review suggests that daily vitamin D supplementation may be more effective than bolus dosing in reducing respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and the potential for adverse effects of rapid shifts in local tissue 1,25OHD levels induced by bolus dosing has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This has led to some suggestion that more regular supplementation of vitamin D could be a preferred regimen, e.g. daily or weekly, with or without bolus dosing, to more smoothly elevate and maintain serum 25OHD; however, one must consider in their design the time it would take to reach the target level of 75&#160;nmol/L (intervention would need to be started months prior to the desired period for anticipated effect) and the compliance issues with placing the burden of supplementation on the parent/carer. Regardless of treatment regimen, the evidence to date suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be more effective in improving asthma outcomes in the paediatric population as opposed to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and ours is the first trial to examine the use of a bolus vitamin D dose in children with asthma. In terms of compliance and rapidly attaining a serum 25OHD level &gt;75&#160;nmol/L, the bolus dose appears ideal.</p><p>Our group included both children with persistent and episodic asthma. One may hypothesise that the response to vitamin D potentially differs between these groups. However, even amongst asthma specialists, there is notable intra-patient and between-physician variability in classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], due to third-party reporting of symptoms and the inability to obtain standard lung function tests in preschoolers; thus, we acknowledge that the accuracy of this classification is debatable. We also acknowledge that some would hesitate to definitively diagnose asthma in children &lt;2&#160;years of age, instead classing this group as &#8216;early wheezers&#8217;; however, we applied the Canadian guidelines for asthma diagnosis in preschoolers (i.e. observed obstruction and reversibility) for inclusion in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although our small sample size did not allow stratification of analyses to examine whether vitamin D response differed by age group or asthma classification, this is an interesting consideration for future trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention to rapidly raise total serum 25OHD and correct vitamin D insufficiency; however, our study was underpowered to detect a significant group difference in &#916;25OHD at 3&#160;months. With no cases of a toxic serum 25OHD value or clinically important alteration in key biomarkers, our data inform, but do not prove, the safety of the intervention. Our results provide promising data with a non-significant trend towards a reduction in the rate of rescue oral corticosteroids in the intervention group, which underlines the need for a large-scale trial. The ideal design to test the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> should include the administration of the dose early in the fall or winter, without concurrent daily vitamin D supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>25OHD, 25-hydroxyvitamin D; ADYC, Asthma Flare-up Diary for Young Children; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Ca:Cr, calcium: creatinine ratio; CARIFS, Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu Scale; CI, confidence interval; ECAP, Effects of an Asthma Flare-up on the Parents; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RCT, randomised controlled trial; RR, rate ratio; SABA, short-acting &#946;<sub>2</sub>-agonists; URTI, upper respiratory tract infection</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1483_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Study design and procedures. <sup>*</sup>Asthma Quiz for Kidz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], a 6-item questionnaire, where a score of two or more indicates poor asthma control. <sup>&#8225;</sup>A 3-item questionnaire, developed ad hoc. <sup>&#8747;</sup>A visual paediatric tool, developed ad hoc, adapted from the validated adult Fitzpatrick scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <sup>&#8747;</sup>Food checklists developed by dietitian (MEJ). <sup>&#182;</sup>Asthma Flare-up Diary for Young Children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection and Flu Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; and Effect of a Young Child&#8217;s Asthma Flare-up on the Parent questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <sup>||</sup>URTI, upper respiratory tract infection. <sup>**</sup>ALP, alkaline phosphatase.
