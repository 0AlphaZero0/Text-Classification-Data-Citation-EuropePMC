</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the rumen, bacteria are largely responsible for biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated fatty acid (FA) (Harfoot and Hazlewood, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The most active bacterial species involved in the biohydrogenation of C18 unsaturated FA belong to the Butyrivibrio group (Paillard et al., 2007; Boeckaert et al., 2008; Durmic et al., 2008), including the genus Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio, and the species B. proteoclasticus (previously referred as Clostridium proteoclasticum) (Paillard et al., 2007; Moon et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this group, all bacteria are capable of hydrogenating linoleic acid and forming cis9, trans11-conjugated linoleic acid (c9, t11-CLA), and t11-C18:1 (TVA) as well, whereas only B. proteoclasticus convert TVA to C18:0 (Polan et al., 1964; Kepler et al., 1966). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, within the complex ecosystem of rumen, there were bacteria other than B. proteoclasticus may play a predominant role in the final step of biohydrogenation (Boeckaert et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008; Huws et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of bands from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as Prevotella, Anaerovoax (member of the Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation (Huws et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that bacteria involved in the biohydrogenation pathway are far more complex than the previous deduced from the cultured bacteria (Polan et al., 1964; Kemp et al., 1975; Wallace et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This complexity is compounded by the fact that the majority of microorganisms have not yet been cultured (estimates range from 85% to 95%) (Krause et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, 16S rRNA molecular technique has become the most commonly used measure in microbial ecology (Mackie and Cann, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is reasonable to expect a culture-independent technique (e.g. 16S rRNA gene PCR) could recover more of the Butyrivibrio group fraction from the ecosystem of rumen than culture-dependent techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Among the molecular techniques, DGGE, one of genetic fingerprinting techniques, has its own limitation, which is relatively small fragments with length up to 500 bp (Muyzer and Smalla, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This easily leads to biases in the estimation of diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Complete sequences would provide more reliable phylogenetic comparison with the available database as compared with the short sequences (Stackebrandt and Goebel, 1994). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It is known that garlic (Allium sativum) oil (GO) has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (Reuter et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Several gram-positive bacteria are involved in biohydrogenation of unsaturated FA in the rumen (Harfoot and Hazlewood, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This attracted our interest in whether GO could affect the diversity of the Butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study, using sequence analysis of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene clones, aimed to investigate the diversity of the Butyrivibrio group bacteria and its response to GO supplementation in the rumen of goats. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In this study, the Butyrivibrio group bacteria represented 12.98% of total bacteria in the rumen of goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This result was in line with the previous report with respect to the genus Butyrivibrio isolates which accounted for 10% to 30% of total culturable bacteria in the rumen (Kopečný et al., 2003; Jarvis and Moore, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the Butyrivibrio group in total bacteria tended to be reduced as GO supplementation in the rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>This effect may be due to the wide spectrum of antibacterial activity of GO (Reuter et al., 1996), which consequently leads to changes in the number of bacteria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that the Butyrivibrio group bacteria are complex with considerable unknown species in goat rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In addition to the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio, Butyrivibrio and others within the family Lachnospiraceae in both libraries, some clones classified to the genus Ruminococcus and others within the family Ruminococcaceae were specifically found in the GO group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The family Lachnospiraceae includes the genus Butyrivibrio, Lachnospira and Roseburia (Cotta and Forster, 2006). Butyrivibrio isolates have high genetic diversity (Kopečný et al., 2003), in which the roles of B. fibrisolvens and B. proteoclasticus in biohydrogenation were investigated widely (Jenkins et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Previous study found the concomitant disappearance of unknown Lachnospiraceae strains and a decrease in ruminal C18:0 concentration, suggesting that these unknown bacteria might play a role in in vivo C18:0 production (Boeckaert et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>However, putative taxonomic identification of terminal restriction fragments revealed that uncultured bacteria including those belonging to unclassified Lachnospiraceae were likely associated with TVA and c9, t11-CLA production (Huws et al., 2011). Ruminococcus has been implicated in biohydrogenation in the rumen as reviewed by Durmic et al. (2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Additionally, recent research showed that the unclassified Ruminococcaceae, as shown by DGGE sequences, associated not only with the ruminal concentrations of TVA, c9, t11-CLA, but also with C18:0 (Huws et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In the present phylogenetic tree, clones classified to the genus Ruminococcus and others within the family Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae formed genetically distinct clusters, indicating that their roles in biohydrogenation may be different from the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio and Butyrivibrio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>However, to our knowledge, the actual roles of bacteria belonging to the genus Ruminococcus and others within the family Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae are not determined and need further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the vast majority of clone sequences had low similarity (&lt;97%) with the closest known isolates in both libraries, suggesting that there were many yet unknown species within the Butyrivibrio group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The majority of microorganisms in the rumen have not been cultured (estimates range from 85% to 95%) (Krause et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This partly explains the low similarity of cloned sequences with the known isolates in the present study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In the complex community, the majority of clones resembled the known isolate Ps. ruminis with ≥97% similarity in the Butyrivibrio group bacterial library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, Van Gylswyk et al. (1996) for the first time investigated the feature of Ps. ruminis from the rumen, and reported that Ps. ruminis differed sufficiently from the genus Butyrivibrio and was placed in a new genus. Ps. ruminis closely resembles B. fibrisolvens in many phenotypical characteristics (Van Gylswyk et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Presently, clones closely resembling Ps. ruminis and B. fibrisolvens formed a tight and unique cluster (Pseudobutyrivibrio) in the phylogenetic tree, in which all the sequences were classified to the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Ps. ruminis may have a role similar to B. fibrisolvens in biohydrogenation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there were differences between them. Ps. ruminis contains high medium chain FA (C12 to C15), whereas B. fibrisolvens contains high cellular compositions of long chain FA (C16 to C18) (Van Gylswyk et al., 1996; Kopečný et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, Ps. ruminis was reported to have high isomerase activity which converts the cis-12 bonds of linoleic acid (c9, c12-CLA) to trans-11 bonds (Koppová et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Therefore, species resembling Ps. ruminis may contribute to the accumulation of c9, t11-CLA in the rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In addition, B. fibrisolvens is capable of hydrogenating linoleic acid and forming c9, t11-CLA, and TVA as well (Polan et al., 1964; Kepler et al., 1966). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Considering the higher proportion of Ps. ruminis in the libraries, Ps. ruminis may play a more important role than B. fibrisolvens in the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid to c9, t11-CLA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The diversity of the Butyrivibrio group bacteria was modified by GO supplementation in the rumen as revealed by Shannon index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The reason behind this was not very clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>A previous report showed that high concentration (312 mg/L of culture fluid) of GO did not have detrimental effects on rumen microbial fermentation in a continuous culture trial (8 d), in contrast with the effects observed in a batch fermentation trial (24 h) (Busquet et al., 2005). Busquet et al. (2005) suggested that after longer adaptation, the microbial population inhibited by GO could be replaced by other resistant bacterial groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This replacement might lead to modification of the Butyrivibrio group bacterial community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Among the composition of bacteria, specific appearances of B. fibrisolvens and R. flavefaciens were observed in control and GO groups, respectively. R. flavefaciens is one of the most predominant fibrolytic bacteria in the rumen (Hespell et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In the future, it is important to verify the roles of R. flavefaciens in the biohydrogenation in rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the bacterial species (&gt;97% similarity) resembling B. fibrisolvens and R. flavefaciens accounted for 0.70% and 0.86%, respectively, of total bacteria in goat rumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>A previous report showed that the proportion of 16S rRNA gene copies attributable to B. fibrisolvens and R. flavefaciens were &lt;0.03% and 0.5% to 1%, respectively, of the total bacteria from the rumen of lactating cows, as investigated by relative quantification real-time PCR (Stevenson and Weimer, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In addition to animal species, diets and methodology used were the possible reasons that caused this discrepancy in the proportion of B. fibrisolvens in total ruminal bacteria between the two experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The low proportion of B. fibrisolvens in the rumen as reported by Stevenson and Weimer (2007) may lead to its unlikely selection from plasmids in the total bacterial library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Owing to the antibacterial activity (Reuter et al., 1996), the possible inhibition of GO on B. fibrisolvens may also partly illustrate the disappearance of B. fibrisolvens in GO group library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>For the lack of appearance of R. flavefaciens in control library, the report that bacteriocins produced by B. fibrisolvens inhibited ruminococci growth (Krause et al., 1999) may in part explain this phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study revealed that the Butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% of total bacteria the rumen of goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Many unique unknown bacterial sequences were found in the Butyrivibrio group bacterial library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the roles of these unknown bacteria need further investigation. </plain></SENT>
