</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>T cells (TC) do not recognize natural antigens but short peptides (called T cell epitopes) which are presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of specialized antigen presenting cells (APCs) after uptake and processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The interaction between T cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and MHC (TCRpMHC) is one of the most important processes in adaptive immunology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed structural mechanism of T cell activation (TCA) is still unknown [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Several models for the mechanisms involved in TCR triggering have been proposed [2]: roughly they can be grouped in aggregation models, models based on conformational changes, and segregation models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is known that T cells can recognize seemingly dissimilar epitopes [3] where sequence similarity alone is not sufficient to explain immunogenicity [4] suggesting that structural rearrangements [5], changes in heat capacity (which can be an indicator of conformational change or flexibility [6]), biochemical similarities [7], hydrophobicity, molecular weight and structural preferences [8] may play an additional important role in determining immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Hence it is difficult to develop predictive methods for peptide immunogenicity and only few methods have been published. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For example, POPI [9] and its extension POPISK [8] are based on physicochemical properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Also the general alignment methods ALIGN [10] and PSI-BLAST [11] were used to align new peptides with known immunogenic ones [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the binding affinity between peptide and MHC can be predicted with rather high accuracy [12] and therefore many predictive studies use the peptide binding affinity to MHC as an approximation for immunogenicity [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, this does not provide the full picture: while binding affinity (usually &lt;500 nM [14]) is a prerequisite for immunogenicity, the magnitude of the pMHC affinity does not correlate well with the magnitude of immunogenicity ([8] and therein references). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The explanation for immunogenicity is rather to be found in a synergistic combination of TCRpMHC affinity, mean interaction time, and relative abundance of both complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, to incorporate all these factors in a (structural) predictive model currently does not seem feasible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Molecular dynamics (MD) [15] is a computational method to solve Newton’s equations of motion for a given system of atoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Various MD studies have been performed in relation to TCRpMHC interaction: Cuendet et al. investigated the dissociation of the TCR from the pMHC via a steered MD simulation and gave insight into the dissociation mechanism of two complexes, which differed by only a single amino acid mutation [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Yaneva et al. performed MD simulation studies of HLA-DR3 with and without invariant chain-associated peptide (CLIP) and found that larger conformational changes of alpha-helices flanking the MHC binding groove occur without CLIP [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Wan et al. performed free energy calculations between pMHC and TCR [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Painter et al. [19] as well as Zacharias et al. [20] compared the peptide-bound and non-bound state of the MHC molecule via MD studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Wan et al. published a large scale MD simulation of the whole TCRpMHC complex and CD4 complex including the surrounding membranes [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Rognan et al. studied and predicted the interaction between pMHC and the T cell receptor via molecular dynamics simulation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Haidar et al. performed several in silico point mutations in TCRs to increase the binding affinity to pMHC [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Camacho et al. performed a structural and thermodynamic approach to modeling peptide immunogenicity for protein antibodies [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>De Rosa et al. described a protocol to model the structure of a TCR based on its sequence on a pMHC complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Subsequently they verified their results via MD simulations [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Stavrakoudis perfomed a single MD simulation of the LC13 TCR in complex with HLA-B*08∶01 [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Cuendet et al. performed a steered MD study of 3 TCRpMHC complexes [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study they investigated the dissociation of the TCR on the basis of the reduction of hydrogen bonds, an increase of water in the interface and energetic changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Narzi et al. used MD simulations to investigate the disease associated MHC alleles HLA-B*27∶09 and HLA-B*27∶05 with different viral and self-peptides [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In a previous study our group showed, via a combination of MD simulation, pMHC binding assays, and in vitro T cell activation assays, that an N-terminal peptide flanking region (PFR) of MHC class II can significantly influence the immunogenicity compared to the same peptide without the PFR [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recently we could also show the molecular background of mug pollen Art v 125–36 bound to HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In another study we compared data of 3 altered peptides ligands (APLs) related to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since it is known that altered peptide ligands often induce alterations in the TCRpMHC interface [32] we extended our approach of investigating APLs via MD to a more systematic screening of 172 well described and strongly related TCRpMHC systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we performed a total of 192 MD simulations with a total length of 2 720 ns and found indications that more and less immunogenic complexes might have slightly different initial relaxation dynamics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>It contains the crystal structure of LC13 TCR in combination with HLA-B*08∶01 and the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) peptide with the amino acid sequence FLRGRAYGL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We chose this system for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the TCRpMHC structure has been determined and described as a whole (PDB-id 1mi5; [34]) as well as in its unliganded parts: TCR (PDB-id 1KGC; [35]) and pMHC (PDB-id 1M05; [36]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Secondly, Kjer-Nielsen et al. depict a systematic substitution study of all 9 amino acid positions in the peptide with the remaining 19 standard amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>For each of these mutations they provide the results [34] of a cytotoxicity assay [37] over a range of peptide concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This yields 172 (20+8×19) experimental immunogenicity values for APLs of the same TCR/MHC complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This data set allows for a systematic and explorative comparison between effects induced by more and less immunogenic peptides. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Since the TCRpMHC is a large complex, many authors have only simulated the variable regions of the TCR, the epitope and the α1 and α2 domain for MHC class I, or the α1 and β1 domain for MHC class II. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that this reduction may be legitimate [38]–[42]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Hence we simulated the full TCRpMHC without any simplifications in the available TCRpMHC x-ray structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This includes the constant regions of the TCR as well as the α3 region and β2 microglobulin of the MHC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We performed these amino acid side chain substitutions with SCWRL [44] and visually confirmed them with the substitution method of SPDBV [45], as this combination turned out to be the most appropriate way [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We performed MD simulations using Gromacs 4 [48] according to the following workflow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We immersed each modeled TCRpMHC structure into a three-dimensional explicit water cube with side length of 119 Å, allowing for a minimum distance of 20 Å between protein and box-boundary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we applied periodic boundary conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we used a steepest descent method to minimize the energy of the system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In the next step we warmed the system up to 310 K. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Finally, MD simulations were carried out for a simulation time of 10 ns for each complex (in total yielding a simulation time of 1720 ns) using bond constraints that allowed for an integration step of 3 fs [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Further simulation parameters were set to values derived in one of our previous studies [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the behaviour of the simulations over a longer time period, we additionally performed 50 ns simulations of 20 TCRpMHC complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we choose the complexes with mutations in position 7 of the peptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>This position is considered as pivotal for the recognition process by the TCR since the tyrosine present in the x-ray structure protrudes deep within a pocket created by CDR1alpha, CDR3alpha, and CDR3beta of the TCR [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Together with the 10 ns simulations this yields a total simulation time of 2 720 ns (10×172+20×50). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></list-item></list><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>For each of the 94 regions and each of the 3350 time points (10 ns of simulation time) we performed an unpaired t-test between the RMSD values of the groupM and the groupL TCRpMHC complexes at different significance levels, α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In other words: t-test{[(all “groupM” RMSD values), (all “groupL” RMSD values)] | time, region, α}. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This leads to a number of 314900 (3350×94) unpaired t-tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>These are illustrated as a 1-bit image of significances (see result section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>We conducted this procedure for the 4 thresholds determined above, both fitting strategies (see previous section) and p-value thresholds at α = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively, leading to a total number of 7557600 unpaired t-tests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>It is obvious that p-values of this procedure cannot directly confirm statistical significance on the differences between the two classes due to the large number of tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we merely compute labels indicating whether p&lt;α only, as an intermediate measure for differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Statistical testing is relegated to one step further. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Our new null hypothesis is that there are no consistent differences between groups and thus labels indicating p&lt;α should occur only sporadically and about equally distributed over time and space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The alternative hypothesis is that differences show a systematic structure with a large number of adjacent labels, both in time and space. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>We define three measures, applied to the entire map (image), expressing the extent to which the maps show such a systematic structure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The first such systematicity measure is a reduction of “salt and pepper noise” while the edges of the image are preserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we used a 2-dimensional median filter employing a 3×3 window. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>This systematicity measure is defined aswhere I is the nR x nT image matrix of “pixels” (nR = number of regions, nT = number of time points), with each “pixel” being 1 if p&lt;α in the t-test, 0 otherwise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The term medFilt is the median filter as described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Note, that not all consecutive regions and residues are covalently bound. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>There are 6 exceptions at the end of the regions which are not adjacent to the beginning of the next region (region numbers 4, 12, 20, 39, 60, and 73). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>These regions cannot be expected to correlate with their non-adjacent neighbours in the region list of Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Thus, we computed s1 for 7 distinct sub-images of the 94×3350 image and summed up the results. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>MD simulations could provide ultimate details concerning individual particle motions for many aspects of biomolecular functions [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>They range from the role of solvent in protein dynamics [59] via the description of the structural pathway between the open and closed conformation of GroEL [60], the flexibility of a short peptide linker governing the activation of tyrosine kinases [61], to opening and closing of the long channel in acetylcholinesterase [62], to protein folding [63]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In this study we applied MD to 172 closely related APLs of a well described TCRpMHC system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This approach gave indications that the very early relaxation dynamics differ between groups of TCRpMHC complexes with different levels of peptide immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>On this basis we conclude that there is a correlation between peptide immunogenicity and the way TCRpMHC complexes start their relaxation process from the initial (perturbed) x-ray structure within the first 10 ns of simulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>It was already shown that different physicochemical properties are related to peptide immunogenicity [9] and that structural rearrangement during TCR binding contributes to T cell activation [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>On this basis it is consequential that different physicochemical properties cause different structural dynamics and could be another level of T cell regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>However, we also want to point out that the shortness of the simulations could have introduced a systematic bias, and large conformational changes taking place may not have been sampled by these simulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Additionally an evaluation of a subset of 20 simulations with a length of 50 ns did show differences between the groups, however, they were not statistically significant, which might be caused by the too small sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Hence, further studies with several hundred of complexes with several hundred of nanoseconds each will be necessary to finally prove or disprove differences between more and less immunogenic TCRpMHC complexes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>It is known that the variable loops of the TCR undergo significant changes upon pMHC engagement leading to a loss of flexibility in the loops [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>On this basis our study gives indications that these changes might differ on the basis of different peptide immunogenicity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Thereby our findings agree well with the proposed idea that the TCR functions as a mechanosensor [57] and the beta-chain may play an important role in ligand recognition [32]. </plain></SENT>
