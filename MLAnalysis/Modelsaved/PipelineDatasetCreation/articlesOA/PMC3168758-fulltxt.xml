Nitrogenase is a key enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation. This enzyme, very sensitive to oxygen, is located in bacteroids which represent special kind of rhizobia cells (Hunt and Layzell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1993</xref>). Bacteroids occupy so called infected cells in the nodule interior. An appropriate modification of the respiratory chain of the bacteroids allows them respire efficiently at a very low free oxygen concentration protecting their nitrogenase from inactivation (e.g. Bergersen and Turner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1993</xref>).</p><p>Two factors are considered to be responsible for the maintenance of low oxygen concentration around bacteroids: (1) oxygen diffusion barrier operating in the nodule cortex (Tjepkema and Yocum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1974</xref>) and (2) leghemoglobin protein with high affinity to oxygen located in the cytosol of infected cells (Appleby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1984</xref>). Some authors postulate that respiratory consumption of oxygen by cells at nodule periphery must be considered as the third factor in the control of oxygen concentration within nodule interior (Dalton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>).</p><p>Oxygen diffusion to the root nodule interior is promoted by air filled intercellular spaces between cells of the peripheral tissues because water or protein occluded spaces give high resistance to gas diffusion (Minchin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1997</xref>). Thus, regulation of the volume of air filled intercellular spaces appears to be a key factor in nodule functioning. On the other hand, large leghemoglobin content in the root nodule facilitates high rate of O<sub>2</sub>-flux at low free oxygen to bacteroids (Wittenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1974</xref>). But it must be underlined that in spite of high leghemoglobin concentration, oxygen pool fixed by this protein can support the respiration of bacteroids only by seconds so steady state delivery of oxygen to the nodule interior is necessary to support the respiratory activity of bacteroids (Walsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1995</xref>). Ott et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>) underline that leghemoglobins (1) increase the flux of oxygen to sites of respiration and (2) help to establish very low free-oxygen concentrations within nodules.</p><p>Different treatments can change nodule permeability to oxygen diffusion thus affect nodule metabolism. Example treatments include (1) nodule exposition to non-ambient O<sub>2</sub> concentration or (2) argon:oxygen atmosphere, and (3) stem girdling, detopping or application of fertilizer (for detailes see Wei and Layzell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). There are several concepts on mechanism(s) regulating the nodule&#8217;s permeability to oxygen diffusion in response to the treatments. Most concepts involve changes in the volume of gaseous intercellular spaces in the nodule parenchyma. One concept postulates that the degree of the occlusion of intercellular spaces with glycoproteins (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1991</xref>) or water (Streeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1992</xref>; Purcell and Sinclair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1994</xref>) may influence oxygen diffusion across nodule cortex. Another hypothesis for the regulation of nodule permeability is that oxygen consumption by respiratory activity in the endodermis or nodule parenchyma is a key component of the diffusion barrier (Dalton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the development of cortical tissues of pea root nodules with special focus on the nodule parenchyma. Most observations, which touched the problem of nodule resistance to oxygen diffusion, were curried out on soybean root nodules, which are of determinate type. Our investigations were done on pea root nodules representing indeterminate type of nodule with its persistent meristem and characteristic zonation. Cytological and cytochemical observations showed that nodule parenchyma of pea nodules is composed of two different cell types. One adjacent to the infected cells (inner parenchyma) shares common properties to the uninfected cells of the bacteroidal tissue but the other one (outer parenchyma) posses shrinking vacuoles, diluted cytoplasm and infolded radial cell walls as a result of turgor collapse. The importance of cell vacuolation to the functioning of the outer parenchyma cells and probably the whole nodule is underlined by shrinkage of vacuoles within inner parenchyma and uninfected cells observed after shoot removal. It is proposed that the fate of cell vacuolation within the outer parenchyma of pea nodules is important for regulation of oxygen diffusion to the nodule interior.</p><p>It is also postulated that cell wall infoldings together with a material of RER origin between them may be involved in the functioning of gas diffusion barrier by regulation of the volume of the intercellular spaces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant culture</title><p>Pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L. cv.

The resistance to oxygen diffusion seems to be necessary to protect oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase against damage (Appleby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1984</xref>) and may be achieved by an occlusion of intercellular spaces with proteins and/or water. Intercellular spaces occluded with glycoproteins were recognized as an important factor responsible for low conductance of the nodule periphery to oxygen (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1991</xref>; Iannetta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1993</xref>). Some authors postulated that also water filled intercellular spaces could give increased resistance to oxygen diffusion. The existence of water occlusions in the intercellular spaces of the nodule parenchyma was proved by electron microscopy observations (Weisbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1999</xref>). But operation of a rapid osmotic mechanism for adjustment of the nodule permeability to oxygen diffusion was questioned by Van Cauwenberghe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1994</xref>), who observed no changes in the number and the cross-sectional area of gaseous intercellular spaces under 2&#160;h exposure of soybean nodules to 80% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Observations were done on pea root nodules which represent the indeterminate growth pattern. Because of their zonation, such nodules give an extraordinary possibility to make direct comparisons between young and mature nodule tissues (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Light and electron microscopy observations of nodule parenchyma located opposite to the early symbiotic zone of pea nodules revealed that intercellular spaces were occluded by a material (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This material probably corresponds to different proteins (VandenBosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1989</xref>; Nap and Bisseling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1990</xref>; VandenBosch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1994</xref>) and isoflavones (Grandmaison and Ibrahim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1995</xref>) which were detected in intercellular occlusions of legume nodules. Proteins alone or together with flavonoids are recognized as a major factor regulating nodule resistance to oxygen diffusion (Minchin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1997</xref>).</p><p>Completely occluded intercellular spaces were observed within nodule parenchyma located opposite to the early symbiotic zone of pea nodules (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c and d</xref>). This finding is in good accordance with earlier studies which demonstrated strong correlation between low level of free oxygen and the oneset of nitrogenase synthesis (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1997</xref>; Sheehy and Thornley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1998</xref>). It cannot be excluded that differentiation of rhizobia cells into bacteroids demands lowering of oxygen concentration within early symbiotic zone which is achieved by occlusion of intercellular spaces within nodule parenchyma. In case of nodule parenchyma located opposite to the late symbiotic zone, occluded or partially occluded intercellular spaces were visible within the outer nodule parenchyma. In opposition to the outer parenchyma, the inner parenchyma located opposite to the late symbiotic zone, possessed large intercellular spaces without any visible material. So, the distribution of the material depends on the maturity of the symbiotic tissue suggesting its importance to the functioning of the nodule parenchyma and the whole nodule as well.</p><p>Unstressed, functioning pea root nodules (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) developed the outer parenchyma cells with characteristic vacuolar shrinkage. But, it should be underlined that observed vacuolar shrinkage is to a certain extend compensated by cytoplasm expansion so it has no profound effect on the cell volume as in case of stomata cells (Raven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1987</xref>). Turgor loss manifested by vacuolar shrinkage of the cells resulted in formation of the radial wall infoldings. Such cells are probably very sensitive to even fine changes of the osmotic pressure in symplast and apoplast and can take up or release water, thus regulate the permeability of the diffusion barrier to oxygen. This finding is in good agreement with a hypothesis which involves an osmotic regulation of nodule cortex resistance to oxygen diffusion (Purcell and Sinclair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1994</xref>). Such regulation may involve rapid water fluxes across plasma membrane and tonoplast promoted by high expression of plasma membrane and tonoplast aquaporins found within inner cortex of soybean nodules (Fleurat-Lessard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>).</p><p>An appearance of new cells with shrinking vacuoles in the inner parenchyma and uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) as a response to shoot removal, suggests that (1) shrinkage of vacuoles is an important factor in regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen diffusion and (2) an enhancement in the resistance to oxygen diffusion to prevent nitrogenase from inactivation is realized by cell turgor collapse.</p><p>Radial wall infoldings, together with an electron-opaque material between the infoldings, are major structural features of the outer parenchyma cells. On the other hand, an association of the material with RER cysternae, mitochondria and Golgi bodies suggests an activity of the infoldings in regulation of O<sub>2</sub> entry into nodules. This suggestion is supported by the fact that an electron-opaque material seems to keep the structure of infoldings making them steeper. So, it is probable that cell wall infoldings and material accumulated between them, together with associated organella form a special apparatus important for the functioning of the outer parenchyma. Unusual properties of the infoldings are also underlined by cell wall discontinuities often observed within or close to them. The discontinuities may result from mechanical tensions and/or digestive processes. This observation also suggests a complexity of both, the outer parenchyma structure and functioning.</p><p>An importance of cell vacuolation within nodule symbiotic tissue and cortical cell layers was proved by vacuolar staining with neutral red, a vital pH indicator, and epifluorescence observations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The specificity of the NR technique for acidotropic staining of vacuoles has been proved. Unprotonated form of neutral red easily crosses the plasma membrane and tonoplast. The dye in its protonated form does not penetrate membranes and is trapped in acidic compartments like plant vacuoles (e.g. Oparka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1991</xref>). Thus, the lack of fluorescence over the vacuoles in mature infected cells indicates that the vacuoles do not represent acidic compartments. But Fedorova and Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>) observed under bright field technique slightly pink vacuoles in mature infected cells after neutral red staining. The discrepancies between both findings may result from the use of different neutral red staining procedures. In particular, in this study attached nodules were stained instead of nodule sections used by Fedorova and Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>).</p><p>Red fluorescence over vacuoles in uninfected cells as well as inner parenchyma cells neighboring infected cells observed in pea nodules suggests common acidic properties of the vacuolar content of the cells. On the base of this finding functional similarity between both cell types can be expected. Newcomb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1989</xref>) also proved functional similarity between the uninfected cells of the bacteroidal tissue and the cells of the inner cortex (nodule parenchyma) with respect to ureide production in determinate nodules.</p><p>On the other hand, neutral red staining revealed distinct differences in the level of vacuolation as well as vacuolar acidity and/or vacuolar content within pea nodule periphery. The diversity in composition of vacuolar content may reflect different metabolic properties and functions of particular cell layers which form nodule cortex.</p><p>Neutral red staining also supported observations done under electron microscopy which showed shrinkage of vacuoles in the outer parenchyma as well as in inner parenchyma and uninfected cells after shoot removal. It emphasized an importance of cell vacuolation to the nodule functioning under stress conditions. So, the level of cell vacuolation and properties of vacuoles may be a very important factors involved in an adjustment of nodule conductance to oxygen.</p><p>Mathematical modeling revealed that oxygen regulation could occur within infected cells. For instance, model proposed by Bergersen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>) allows high respiratory activity of mitochondria within infected cells. Our observations indicate that respiratory activity (showed as SDH activity) was much higher in late symbiotic zone than in adjacent nodule periphery (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), so it is possible that respiratory O<sub>2</sub> consumption by mitochondria and bacteroids of the tissue is important in protection of dinitrogenase activity against oxidative damage. This suggestion is in accordance with the findings of Gardiol et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1987</xref>) who demonstrated that SDH activity is essential for proper bacteroid differentiation. Also, they showed that a mutant lacking SDH activity had much lower rate of oxygen consumption in free-living cultures than did the wild type.</p><p>Because some nodule parenchyma cells exhibited high level of SDH activity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it cannot be excluded that respiratory activity of nodule parenchyma has also an effect onto lowering of oxygen concentration within symbiotic tissue, as well. The observations presented here regarding SDH activity support earlier suggestions (Minchin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1992</xref>; Dalton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1998</xref>) that oxygen diffusion barrier contains a respiratory component located in the nodule periphery.</p><p>Additional resistance to the oxygen diffusion across the nodule cortex can be given by the nodule endodermis (Witty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1987</xref>, Hartmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>). In case of pea, nodule endodermal cells, localized opposite to the late symbiotic zone, were surrounded by suberin lamellae (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Apart from suberin, nodule endodermal cell walls of pea contained lignins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). But according to some authors, suberized barriers seem to be more effective in restriction of oxygen diffusion than lignified (De Simone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>).</p><p>Nodule endodermis is also a good physical barrier for diffusion of carboxyfluorescein, the apoplastic dye (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Because only small amounts of the dye were detected in the outer parenchyma and never reached symbiotic tissue it is suggested that endodermal cells are rather tightly packed with only minorous free space for diffusion of small molecules. Such properties of the endodermal cell layer indicate that endodermis is predestined to give some resistance toward diffusion of oxygen across cortex of pea nodules. Experiments with the use of a membrane impermeant dye (lucifer yellow) supplied under a mild vacuum, showed that the dye infiltrated through nodule endodermis into the inner cortex (Brown and Walsh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1996</xref>). The authors concluded that the nodule endodermis is unlikely to be a significant barrier to oxygen diffusion.</p><p>Finally, EGases were localized immunocytochemically in pea root nodules (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) to determine their influence on the development of nodule cortex. The antibody (anti-EGL1 IgG) used in this study was monospecific as it recognized single band in western blots of wall associated proteins from the host extracts of pea epicotyls or nodules. What is more, the pre-immune serum used in identical western-blot labelling experiments did not produce any cross-reacting signal (data not shown). Higher expression of glucanases was found in expanding cells and their role in cell wall polysaccharide assembly or rearrangement was suggested (Brummell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>). Experiments conducted on pea by Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1996</xref>) showed expression of <italic>EGL1</italic> gene at the highest level in etiolated epicotyls, but also in stems, leaves, flowers, pods and roots. The continuous and high expression of EGases found in the outer cortex cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), which undergo a substantial enlargement, is conspicuous. It suggests an involvement of these enzymes in cell enlargement which may have an impact on the functioning of pea nodules. It was postulated that cell expansion can decrease nodule conductance to oxygen (De Lorenzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1993</xref>; Serraj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1995</xref>). So the outer cortex cells of pea nodules are predestined to take part in regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen as the cells substantially enlarge during development. Additionally, endoglucanases could keep cell walls extensible and enable outer cortex cells to change their shape in response to soil conditions.</p><p>To conclude, the findings in this study indicate that the fate of vacuolation is important for the functioning of the outer parenchyma of pea root nodules. Outer parenchyma cells undergo unusual differentiation processes including the shrinkage of their vacuoles with simultaneous cytoplasm expansion and formation of radial wall infoldings. Such cells might be very sensitive to the external osmotic pressure and release or uptake water thus regulating permeability of intercellular spaces to oxygen. The importance of these cells in nodule functioning is emphasized by the fact that shrinkage of vacuoles was also observed in the inner parenchyma cells as well as uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue after shoot removal.</p><p>Radial wall infoldings, together with densely packed material of RER origin around them, form an apparatus which may be involved in regulation of the volume of intercellular spaces within nodule parenchyma.</p><p>To the authors knowledge this is the first report which shows different properties of the vacuoles across nodule cortex of pea nodules after neutral red staining and subsequent epifluorescence observations. So different functions of particular cortical cell layers can be expected.</p><p>It was also proved that in case of indeterminate nodules, inner parenchyma cells and uninfected cells of the symbiotic tissue share common properties in terms of vacuolar acidity.</p><p>In addition, the current study demonstrates that endoglucanases are important for a substantial cell enlargement during differentiation of the outer cortex. Cell enlargement within outer cortex may be responsible for regulation of nodule conductance to oxygen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Ewa
