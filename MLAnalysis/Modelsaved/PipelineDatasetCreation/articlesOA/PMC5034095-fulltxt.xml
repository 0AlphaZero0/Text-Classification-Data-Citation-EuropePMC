Despite progress in HIV prevention, an estimated 2.1 million new cases of HIV occurred in 2013 [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Importantly, the efficacy of oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection has been demonstrated and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have issued relevant clinical practice guidelines for use of Truvada<sup>&#174;</sup> in this regard [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>However, data are mixed on the effectiveness of topical PrEP with tenofovir (TFV) 1% vaginal gel [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 trial demonstrated a 39% reduction in incident HIV-1 infections with coitally dependent TFV gel [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By contrast, in the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic (VOICE) trial among 5029 women in sub-Saharan Africa, daily TFV 1% vaginal gel did not demonstrate benefit in HIV prevention [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, the Follow-on African Consortium for Tenofovir Studies 001 study reported no effectiveness of TFV 1% gel for HIV prevention in women [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CAPRISA 004 noted a 55% reduction in incident herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infections among TFV gel recipients, and similar protection against incident HSV-2 was noted in the VOICE study [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Given these mixed data, the future of TFV gel for HIV prevention is currently unclear; however, other delivery systems are under study for topical delivery of intravaginal TFV.</p><p>Pregnant women are a high priority population for HIV prevention. Observational data suggest that pregnancy may increase risk of HIV acquisition, and pregnant women with untreated HIV infection appear more likely (hazard ratio 2.47, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.85) to transmit HIV to their uninfected male sexual partners when compared to non-pregnant women [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, multiple investigations demonstrate that acquisition of HIV during pregnancy increases the risk for mother-to-child transmission of HIV 3- to 15-fold [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported results from a phase 1 study of single-dose TFV 1% vaginal gel among 16 pregnant women at term [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The favourable safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in that study supported further investigation among a larger group of pregnant women using daily dosing. The primary objectives of the current investigation were to assess the safety and PK of seven consecutive daily doses of TFV 1% vaginal gel among term and near-term pregnant women in the United States. Targeting enrollees first at advanced gestational ages was a deliberately chosen pathway as part of a larger plan for sequential, backwards enrolment of pregnant women at progressively earlier gestational ages, based on favourable findings from interim safety analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>An expanded phase 1 investigation of the safety and PK of seven consecutive days of TFV 1% vaginal gel among healthy term and near-term pregnant women was conducted by the MTN (MTN-008). MTN-008 was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of TFV 1% vaginal gel vs hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) &#8220;placebo&#8221; gel (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01136759) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two study sites, Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, enrolled study participants from April 2011 through September 2013. All study materials were reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at both sites. All participants underwent a thorough informed consent process. Study gel and applicators were provided by CONRAD (Arlington, VA, USA).</p><p>Healthy HIV-uninfected women (based on previous testing, as well as HIV enzyme immunoassay testing done at screening) with a singleton pregnancy were recruited from antenatal clinics. The first cohort of women was enrolled at term (37 to 39 weeks gestation, target <italic>N=</italic>45). After completion of study activities for all women in the term cohort, an independent review of safety and outcome data verified that no findings precluded enrolment of a subsequent cohort of near-term pregnant women. Women at 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 completed weeks of gestation (target <italic>N=</italic>45) were then enrolled and underwent study procedures identical to the term cohort.</p><p>Participants were randomized to active versus placebo gel in a 2:1 ratio for both pregnancy cohorts at both study sites. The targeted sample size for each pregnancy cohort allowed detection of a large difference in the primary safety end point. For an adverse event with a rate of 10% in the placebo arm, our sample size provided 80% power to detect a significantly different rate of 27% in the active gel arm. Specifically, we had 80% power to detect a statistically significant 17% difference (i.e. 10% vs 27%) in the active gel arm. The randomization was performed by an independent statistician using block sizes of six and three.</p><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same in both gestational age cohorts. Women with hypertension, diabetes, other known maternal disease, placental or foetal abnormalities, or history of preterm birth were ineligible. All participants underwent screening for HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and laboratory evidence of renal and liver dysfunction prior to enrolment. On the day of enrolment, physical and pelvic examinations were performed, maternal blood was collected pre-dose, a normal foetal heart rate was detected and noted via foetal doppler, and a single randomly assigned vaginal dose of TFV 1% gel (40 mg TFV) or HEC placebo was administered by blinded study personnel. Women underwent subsequent blood collections to determine serum TFV concentration at one, two, four, six, and eight hours after gel administration. The same in-clinic study procedures took place on day 6. Women were dispensed applicators pre-filled with study product and were directed to insert study product at home once daily for five consecutive days (days 1 to 5).</p><p>Women had baseline and day 6 laboratory and genital tract assessments. In addition, women were contacted by phone on days 1 and 3 of gel use, as well as day 14 (one week after completing gel use), to query for additional adverse events (AEs) or questions surrounding gel use. Study staff attended deliveries to collect maternal and cord blood samples for serum TFV concentrations as well as data on peripartum AEs. Participants were contacted again at two weeks after delivery to collect any additional maternal or neonatal AEs.</p><p>Primary maternal safety end points included grade 2 or higher AEs for laboratory end points (liver and kidney function), genital tract signs/symptoms and specific pregnancy outcomes as defined by the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The relatedness of AEs to study product was determined by site primary investigators. Primary infant end points included admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for greater than 24 hours or the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in the first seven days of life. Secondary end points included assessments of adherence to daily use of TFV 1% gel for seven days and its acceptability among pregnant women. The results of these adherence and acceptability secondary end points will be reported in separate publications.</p><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Tenofovir assays</title><p>Blood was centrifuged within eight hours of collection and the serum was frozen at &#8211;70&#176;C.

PK findings suggest that absorption among term and near-term pregnant women using the gel daily is similar to non-pregnant women and produces low overall systemic exposure for the mother and foetus. While TFV was quantifiable in roughly a quarter of the newborns at the time of delivery, concentrations were low and not associated with detectable adverse outcomes. These data suggest that TFV gel use among pregnant women at or near term appears to be safe and would be unlikely to pose a significant risk to mothers or their newborns.</p><p>Our previous work failed to detect any safety signal and noted low exposure and limited drug transfer via the placenta of single-dose TFV gel use in 16 term pregnant women (16). The current study was the next step to investigate the safety and PK of this candidate HIV prevention drug with more extended exposure (albeit modest at seven days) among a larger sample size. The stepwise approach of enrolling pregnant women at term, carrying out an interim safety analysis and subsequently enrolling near-term women was a deliberately cautious strategy [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this approach, the next planned investigation would have entailed daily dosing of pregnant women for 28 consecutive days at progressively earlier points in pregnancy, going back until the end of the first trimester, with interim safety analyses prior to embarking on each successive earlier gestational age regimen. This approach was supported by reassuring safety data available at the time of protocol development on oral TFV use in pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], single-dose TFV gel in pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as well as from numerous studies of TFV gel use among non-pregnant women [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Since the design and performance of this study, newer data suggest that longer-term (weeks) exposure <italic>in utero</italic> to TFV via maternal oral dosing for HIV treatment in pregnancy may have effects on neonatal growth and bone density [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The relevance of these more recent findings among infants exposed to significantly higher drug levels via oral dosing (roughly 50- to 100-fold higher compared to vaginal dosing) for significantly longer periods of time is unclear. Data from a separate ongoing HIV prevention agent exposure registry (MTN-016) could permit investigation into potential impact on growth parameters in the first year of life among infants exposed to TFV gel [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The future of TFV gel for HIV prevention is currently uncertain. Accumulating and intriguing data suggesting that TFV gel has efficacy in prevention of new HSV-2 infections is relevant to women at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Incident HSV-2 infections particularly in the late second or third trimester carry a significant risk of neonatal HSV infection with associated severe health consequences [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A novel approach to prevention of incident HSV-2 in pregnancy could hold considerable potential for curbing HSV-2-related neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Despite the relatively small size, the lack of an obvious safety signal provides some reassurance about future investigations and subsequent potential use of this product in pregnancy. The combination in this study of the non-worrisome pregnancy outcomes and the novel study design warrants attention despite the unclear future of TFV gel [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although this was a relatively small study with limited power to detect either rare adverse outcomes or other outcomes occurring at modest rates, use of a control arm helps to suggest that the AEs noted were related to the pregnancy itself and not TFV gel. Enrollees in both arms had modest and equivalent rates of untoward pregnancy and neonatal outcomes that fell within expected population background rates [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Our PK findings indicate that term and late preterm pregnant women have the same low peak drug concentrations and systemic exposure as non-pregnant women when using the same analytical methods [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, MTN-008 pregnant women were not different in terms of C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-8</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0004">Table 4</xref>) when compared to steady-state values in a non-pregnant historical cohort of women taking daily TFV 1% gel [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additional reports in non-pregnant women receiving TFV 1% gel have noted peak TFV concentrations that largely resemble our results [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because the concentration&#8211;time profile after an observed initial dose is consistent between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the statistically significant difference in pre-dose (day 6) TFV concentrations may be due to a small adherence difference prior to sampling or to small PK differences between non-randomized populations. The magnitude of the difference is small compared to post-dose concentrations and does not affect the key finding of highly concordant TFV concentrations between pregnant and non-pregnant populations with observed dosing. This understanding provides confidence in our interpretation of the reassuring safety findings, albeit in a relatively small population.</p><p>This study has several strengths, including (1) novel pregnancy study design, (2) partially directly observed dosing on days 0 and 6 and (3) inclusion of a placebo gel arm, permitting a more robust comparison. However, the sample size and associated low power of the study limit the ability to draw definite conclusions regarding safety. While women enrolled as early as 34 weeks, this precludes an understanding of safety earlier in pregnancy. Several other limitations should also be noted. By design, product use occurred among a preselected group of healthy pregnant women, challenging generalizability. While vaginal tissue concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), unlike serum TFV concentrations, may not have fully achieved steady-state concentrations by six days in our study, we believe these women had very nearly achieved steady state (&gt;85%) based on prior reports of TFV-DP tissue half-life, between two and three days in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), vaginal tissue and vaginal tissue cells [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Based on the colon and vaginal tissue kinetics of TFV-DP, the concentrations reported in our previous single-dose study of term infants and their mothers (MTN-002) likely represent concentrations less than half of steady-state concentrations. Our current report goes further in working to establish a safety profile for longer dosing periods and at earlier stages of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>TFV gel use in term and near-term pregnancy appears to be safe and produces low serum drug levels. This study is an important sequential step in understanding the safety and PK of TFV 1% gel in pregnancy. Should an indication for HSV-2 prevention be sought for TFV gel or other topical formulation, these data can help form a foundation for future investigations to assure that pregnant women can use it safely at or near term. The approach used herein will be informative for future pharmaceutical products seeking licensure for use by reproductive age women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study team like to acknowledge all the women who participated in this clinical trial.</p><sec id="S0008"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Microbicide Trials Network, which is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (UM1AI068633, UM1AI068615, UM1AI106707), with co-funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, all components of the National Institutes of Health.
