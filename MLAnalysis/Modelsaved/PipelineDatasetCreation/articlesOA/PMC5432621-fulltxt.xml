Previous studies have led to the identification and functional characterization of some enzymes and genes in this pathway. However, the underlying genetic map is still far from being complete. For example, the specific steps of monoterpene metabolism and its regulation are largely unknown. With the aim of identifying new candidates for the missing links, we applied an integrative functional genomics approach based on the targeted metabolic and genome-wide transcript profiling of Moscato Bianco ripening berries. In particular, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of free and bound terpenoid compounds was combined with microarray analysis in the skins of berries collected at five developmental stages from pre-<italic>veraison</italic> to over-ripening. Differentially expressed metabolites and probes were identified in the pairwise comparison between time points by using the early stage as a reference. Metabolic and transcriptomic data were integrated through pairwise correlation and clustering approaches to discover genes linked with particular metabolites or groups of metabolites. These candidate transcripts were further checked for co-localization with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting aromatic compounds. Our findings provide insights into the biological networks of grapevine secondary metabolism, both at the catalytic and regulatory levels. Examples include a nudix hydrolase as component of a terpene synthase-independent pathway for monoterpene biosynthesis, genes potentially involved in monoterpene metabolism (cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, epoxide hydrolases, glucosyltransferases), transport (vesicle-associated proteins, ABCG transporters, glutathione S-transferases, amino acid permeases), and transcriptional control (transcription factors of the ERF, MYB and NAC families, intermediates in light- and circadian cycle-mediated regulation with supporting evidence from the literature and additional regulatory genes with a previously unreported association to monoterpene accumulation).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>grapevine</kwd><kwd>Muscat</kwd><kwd>monoterpene</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>berry skin</kwd><kwd>metabolic and transcript profiling</kwd><kwd>integration</kwd><kwd>candidate gene</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="131"/><page-count count="24"/><word-count count="15374"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A great deal of the consumer interest in wine derives from its aroma characteristics. The major aroma-impact compounds in grape and wine are terpenoids (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and in a wider acception also C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids), phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, fatty acid derivatives, sulfur compounds, and methoxypyrazines (Dunlevy et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ebeler and Thorngate, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Panighel and Flamini, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Robinson et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Black et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The typical floral and citrus attributes of Muscat varieties are primarily determined by a combination of linalool, geraniol and nerol (Rib&#233;reau-Gayon et al., <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The same monoterpenes contribute to the varietal aroma of Riesling in association with the linalool oxides, hydroxy-linalool, &#945;-terpineol, citronellol, terpendiol I and hydroxy-trienol (Rapp, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Likewise rose oxide, which is highly correlated with Muscat score in grapes (Ruiz-Garc&#237;a et al., <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), is also a potent odorant in Scheurebe and Gew&#252;rztraminer (Guth, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Ong and Acree, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Luan et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>The terpene biosynthetic pathway is generally well known (Dudareva et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), even though a number of alternative non-canonical reactions may occur (Sun et al., <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Of the two systems responsible for the production of plant isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the primarily cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) and the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, the latter has been suggested as the dominant route for monoterpene biosynthesis in grape berries (Luan and W&#252;st, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Several lines of evidence (Battilana et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Duch&#234;ne et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Emanuelli et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Martin et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wen et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) support the existence of at least two rate-limiting enzymes in the grapevine MEP pathway, namely the first (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, VvDXS1) and the last (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase, VvHDR). Both IPP and DMAPP are substrates for short-chain prenyltransferases, which produce prenyl diphosphate precursors for the large family of terpene synthases (TPSs). To date around 40 full-length VvTPSs out of 53&#8211;89 predicted functional enzymes have been biochemically characterized (Martin et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and some major players in grape Muscat aroma have been identified, like the &#945;-terpineol synthase <italic>VvTer</italic>, the linalool synthase <italic>Lis</italic>, the linalool/nerolidol synthase <italic>VvPNLinNer1</italic> and the geraniol synthase <italic>VvPNGer</italic> (Ebang-Oke et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Martin and Bohlmann, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Martin et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Matarese et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wen et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Once a terpenoid alcohol skeleton has been produced, extensive modifications determine the final monoterpene composition of grapes and wines (Rib&#233;reau-Gayon et al., <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>; Williams et al., <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Luan et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Mathieu et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These secondary transformations are (at least in part) catalyzed by enzymes (Luan et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>; D'Onofrio et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) that in most cases have not been identified. The only exceptions are the three grape monoterpenol &#946;-D-glucosyltransferases VvGT7, VvGT14 and VvGT15 and the cytochrome P450 CYP76F14 (B&#246;nisch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Ilc et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The main reason for this gap is that such enzymes belong to large families with broad substrate tolerance and overlapping activities (Schwab, <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Schwab and W&#252;st, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A better knowledge of the missing enzymes might allow us to manipulate the formation of grape aroma compounds. For example, limiting the reactions responsible for the depletion of key odorants (e.g., through the selection of genotypes with low monoterpene glycosyltransferase or oxygenase activities in breeding programs) could be an alternative approach for the improvement of grape/wine flavor (B&#246;nisch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; Hjelmeland and Ebeler, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The grapevine terpenoid pathway is intricately regulated by endogenous and environmental factors that enable spatially and temporally controlled metabolite production (Ebeler and Thorngate, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Robinson et al., <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In other plant species a network of transcription factors (TFs) is involved in the regulation of this pathway, including members of the AP2, AP2/ERF, bZIP, MYB, MYC, NAC, WRKY, and YABBY families (De Geyter et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Patra et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Nieuwenhuizen et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A tight regulation of terpene biosynthesis is additionally exerted at the post-transcriptional level involving both structural enzymes and transcription factors (Vom Endt et al., <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hemmerlin, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rodr&#237;guez-Concepci&#243;n and Boronat, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), as observed also in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (B&#246;nisch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; Matarese et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A number of transcription factors that might control terpene synthesis have been recently predicted in grapevine through gene co-expression network analysis (Wen et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), though none of them has been yet demonstrated to regulate the expression of relevant terpene pathway genes. Similarly, the reasons of the differential accumulation of the main monoterpenes in grape berry tissues across development (G&#252;nata et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Wilson et al., <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Park et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Luan and W&#252;st, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), which is reflected in the identification of specific QTLs for linalool and geraniol/nerol (Doligez et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Battilana et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), are still unknown.</p><p>This work aims at a better understanding of aroma determination in grapevine and at the identification of candidate genes for further functional analysis. To this purpose, we integrated gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of selected metabolites with microarray-based transcriptomic analysis in Moscato Bianco (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.) ripening berries. According to the observed associations between metabolite and transcript profiles, we report several genes that may control the accumulation of free and glycosidically bound monoterpenes and additional aroma-related compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material for metabolic and microarray analyses</title><p>Berries of the cultivar Moscato Bianco (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.) were collected from pre-<italic>veraison</italic> to over-ripening in 2005, 2006, and 2007 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In the lab, berries were pooled in order to minimize environmental effects and then divided into two (2005 and 2007) or three (2006) batches.

For the alignment against the CRIBI gene set, the following parameters were used: sequence identity &#8805;90%, minimum alignment length of 95%, maximum number of mismatches of 5 and maximum number of gaps of 5. The aligned 70-mers were found to correspond to 7,162 and 8,260 unique gene predictions at CRIBI and IASMA, respectively. The 14,562 probes were also grouped into main functional categories according to the Mapman BIN structure (Rotter et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray validation via real-time PCR</title><p>Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the microarray results.

In a first identification step of candidates, the most stable expression changes were preferred to the biggest ones, hence the microarray probes with adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 in all comparisons were considered, irrespective of their fold change (4,450). Working at probe level instead of gene level was chosen for two main reasons: (1) different probes supposedly matching to the same gene (especially long genes) often show different expression values, which might be an indicator of alternative transcription and (2) the sequence specificity to CRIBI 12X gene predictions is not optimal for a number of probes spotted on the AROS array (this is especially true for probes related to secondary metabolism); for a detailed assessment of probe specificity, Moscato Bianco genome and transcriptome assembly would be required, which is out of the scope of this work.</p><sec><title>Pairwise correlation</title><p>Pearson pairwise correlation was calculated between transcripts and metabolites across all the time points (log<sub>2</sub>-transformed differentials in the pairwise comparisons 2 vs. 1, 3 vs. 1, 4 vs. 1, and 5 vs. 1). With the goal of identifying aroma regulatory genes we also tested a two-step strategy, which was based on (1) search for candidate metabolism and transport genes by direct correlation with metabolites and (2) expression pairwise correlations between these enzyme/transporter-coding genes and any regulatory gene within the microarray. For this aim, Pearson correlations were computed both between differential gene expression ratios (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and microarray channel intensities (<italic>n</italic> = 32, when considering technical replicates separately).</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation biclustering</title><p>Based on the assumption that a gene might regulate the accumulation of a metabolite only at specific stages during ripening, correlation biclustering between transcripts and metabolites was achieved with QUBIC (Li et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) (log<sub>2</sub>-transformed data, Pearson correlation). Compared to the traditional clustering methods, biclustering algorithms discover local co-expression patterns (groups of genes/metabolites that show similar patterns under a specific subset of the experimental conditions) (Madeira and Oliveira, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We manually inspected our biclustering data only in a few exemplar cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Soft clustering</title><p>Soft clustering of the metabolite and transcript differentials was performed by using the R/Bioconductor Mfuzz package (Kumar and Futschik, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) with the default value 1.25 for the fuzzy parameter m. A membership value in the range of 0&#8211;1 was assigned to each metabolite and probe. Soft clustering offers several advantages with respect to hard clustering; in particular, it has been suggested to be more suitable for time course microarray data in which expression patterns are often not well separated (Futschik and Carlisle, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Kumar and Futschik, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The biological significance of the clusters was analyzed by enrichment analysis of the MapMan functional categories assigned to the probes in each cluster. Specifically, Chi square and Fisher statistical tests were employed to search for significant differences (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) between the observed number of probes within each MapMan functional category per cluster and the expected number of probes in that category based on the overall AROS genome array expression distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of candidate genes</title><p>From the whole set of transcripts with a potential association to monoterpenes (based on their correlation with metabolites and membership to soft clusters/biclusters harboring metabolites) we selected a subset of genes with significant expression changes and/or supporting evidence from the literature, like a relevant function in other plant species, co-localization with QTLs for monoterpene content and coexpression with genes involved in the terpene pathway. In particular, the QTL co-localization was stated when the V1 gene predictions fell into the 1-LOD confidence intervals of the QTLs for linalool, geraniol and nerol reported by Doligez et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and Battilana et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) based on the analysis of different segregating progenies in 2&#8211;3 seasons (depending on the progeny). The genomic region corresponding to each QTL confidence interval was determined from the physical position of the two neighboring markers, while the V1 gene prediction physical position was retrieved from Grimplet et al.

To this purpose, the average concentration among these seasons was computed for each metabolite at each developmental stage. Pearson and Spearman correlations were calculated between the transcriptional and metabolic data expressed as log<sub>2</sub> fold changes at the stages 2-5 (E-L 34.5, 36, 38, and 39) with respect to the first stage (E-L 31).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Our study gives an example of the systems biology approach.

The protocol used for the chemical analysis was optimized for molecules belonging to the monoterpenoid class, however it allowed the simultaneous quantification of additional metabolites. In particular, the content of 21 monoterpenoids, 3 C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids, 5 phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and 3 C<sub>6</sub> aliphatic compounds was quantified from pre-<italic>veraison</italic> to over-ripening in 2005, 2006, and 2007. For several compounds a coherent accumulation trend was observed in the different years (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12">S1A</xref>). The most significant correlation between seasons was observed for free linalool, nerol, &#945;-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hexanol, <italic>cis</italic>-3-hexen-1-ol, bound linalool, geraniol, nerol, <italic>trans</italic>-furan linalool oxide and benzyl alcohol. Other metabolites appeared instead to be more sensitive to seasonal effects, like rainfall and temperature (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12">S1B</xref>). Hereafter, we will refer to 2006, which is the year assayed by microarray analysis.</p><p>The most abundant metabolites were monoterpenes (hydroxy-diendiol I, <italic>trans</italic>-geranic acid, linalool, geraniol and nerol), with concentrations higher than 600 &#956;g/kg of berries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S2</xref>). The majority of monoterpenoids reached the highest amount in their glycosidically bound form. The main exceptions are represented by high oxidation state monoterpenes, like the two pyran linalool oxides, the two diendiols and rose oxide I. A clear prevalence of the free form was also observed for the C<sub>6</sub> aliphatic compounds, while the most abundant C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids and phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were glycosidically bound, in agreement with previous analyses (S&#225;nchez Palomo et al., <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; D'Onofrio et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The quantity of many metabolites was significantly (at least 2-fold) altered during ripening. The compounds that changed most with respect to pre-<italic>veraison</italic> were linalool, geraniol, nerol, cis/<italic>trans</italic>-8-hydroxy-linalool, hydroxy-diendiol I and II in both forms; <italic>cis</italic>-furan linalool oxide, <italic>trans</italic>-geranic acid, 7-hydroxy-geraniol, 7-hydroxy-citronellol, hydroxy-trienol in their free form; <italic>trans-</italic>furan linalool oxide, 3-oxo-&#945;-ionol, methyl salicylate, hexanol and <italic>cis</italic>-3-hexen-1-ol in their bound form (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM14">S3A,D</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of accumulation along berry development varied with the metabolite (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S2</xref>). The concentration of the three compounds mainly contributing to Muscat aroma (linalool, geraniol, and nerol) was from low to moderate before <italic>veraison</italic> (August 17 or stage E-L 34.5 in this work) and then increased during ripening. Free linalool reached its maximum on September 13 (technological maturity or stage E-L 38) and decreased during over-ripening. A similar behavior was observed in 2005 and 2007, even though the peak corresponded to slightly earlier stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), proving that technological and aroma ripening might not occur at the same time (Vilanova et al., <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Otherwise, free geraniol and nerol as well as the three bound forms showed a steady increase in their content during the sampling period. These results confirm previous findings (G&#252;nata et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Ebang-Oke et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Piazzolla et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Several additional patterns were observed. For example, the four linalool oxides could be detected at berry onset; their concentration reached a minimum between July 31 (stage E-L 31.5 in this work) and August 8 (stage E-L 33) and then increased in at least one of the two forms to peak on September 13 (stage E-L 38) in their free form. While the glycosidically bound forms of the two diendiols showed a similar pattern of accumulation, free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol were highly concentrated before <italic>veraison</italic> and decreased over the course of berry ripening, with a trend opposite to that of free hydroxy-diendiol II (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The high content of free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol at berry onset, when free linalool was not yet produced, may indicate that their accumulation is regulated independently from that of their precursor.</p><p>In the attempt of simplification, metabolite network analysis was performed on a total of 52 (26 free and 26 glycosidically bound) compounds. Metabolite grouping was obtained through hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis by using different metabolic data sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM14">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM15">S4</xref>). It is clearly evident that most monoterpenes are tightly correlated, which is indicative of their common metabolic origin and in agreement with previous findings (Ilc et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). In particular, when considering the absolute amount of free metabolites at 13 time points, three main clusters (AU &gt; 95%) could be identified: (1) <italic>cis</italic>-pyran linalool oxide (OxD), <italic>trans</italic>-pyran linalool oxide (OxC), <italic>trans</italic>-furan linalool oxide (OxA) and <italic>cis</italic>-furan linalool oxide (OxB); (2) geraniol, nerol, <italic>cis</italic>-8-hydroxy-linalool, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, <italic>trans</italic>-geranic acid, citronellol, hydroxy-diendiol II, <italic>trans</italic>-8-hydroxy-linalool, linalool, hexanol, <italic>trans</italic>-3-hexen-1-ol, rose oxide I, rose oxide II and &#945;-terpineol; (3) 4-terpineol and hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol. Additionally, within the second cluster a clear separation could be noticed between linalool on one side, geraniol and nerol on the other side (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM15">S4A</xref>). Oppositely, when considering the absolute amount of bound metabolites at 13 time points a single significant cluster was obtained, which included most of the analyzed compounds. It can be easily noticed that bound <italic>cis</italic>-furan linalool oxide (OxB) has a peculiar behavior with respect to the other three linalool oxides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM15">S4C</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation heatmap of free (A)</bold> and bound <bold>(B)</bold> log<sub>2</sub>-transformed metabolites analyzed at 13 time points in 2006.

This separation is mainly due to the decrease of free linalool, but not geraniol and nerol, from technological maturity onwards (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The highly similar accumulation trend of geraniol and nerol likely reflects a common chemical origin (nerol is a geometrical isomer of geraniol), while their relationship with linalool is less clear.

Hereafter, we discuss the most interesting findings from the present work; obvioulsy, we can't exclude that additional genes not included in this microarray platform may participate in monoterpene biosynthesis, as well as we can't know <italic>a priori</italic> whether our findings will be reproduced in other Muscat varieties with a genetic background different from Moscato Bianco.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of the most significant candidate genes for monoterpene biosynthesis</bold>.</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>They were selected from the whole list of genes with a potential association to monoterpenes (based on their correlation with metabolites and/or membership to soft clusters/biclusters harboring metabolites) reported in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>, giving priority to the genes with the biggest expression changes, supporting evidence from the literature (relevant function in other plant species, co-localization with QTLs for monoterpene content, coexpression with genes involved in the terpene pahway), profile consistency between microarray and qRT-PCR analyses (the genes assayed by both techniques are marked with an asterisk).

The role of <italic>VvDXS</italic> isoforms in the development of aroma was previously investigated by real-time PCR on the same samples of Moscato Bianco analyzed here (Battilana, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), for which reason we did not repeat the analysis. In that study a significant up-regulation of <italic>VvDXS1</italic> was found to precede the peak of linalool, geraniol and nerol resulting in a positive correlation between <italic>VvDXS1</italic> expression profile and monoterpenoid accumulation. On the Grape AROS V1.0 array no probe could be found for <italic>VvDXS1</italic>, whereas four probes corresponding to other <italic>DXS</italic> isoforms (VIT_04s0008g04970 and VIT_00s0218g00110) were not differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence from different plant species suggest that flux control in the MEP pathway does not converge on a single rate-limiting enzyme, such as DXS, but may involve other enzymes like DXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) and HDR (Vranov&#225; et al., <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hemmerlin, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The lack of significant modulation and the decreasing trend during berry ripening observed for <italic>VvDXR</italic> in our study (VIT_17s0000g08390 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) do not support a regulatory role, in agreement with Rodr&#237;guez-Concepci&#243;n et al. (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and Mendoza-Poudereux et al. (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Oppositely, the expression of <italic>VvHDR</italic> (VIT_03s0063g02030 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) is consistent with the <italic>veraison</italic>-initiated accumulation of monoterpenes, as reported by Martin et al. (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Wen et al. (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p><p><italic>Middle and late terpenoid pathway genes</italic>. In other plant species GPPS works as a heterodimeric complex; in particular, the levels of GPPS small subunit, but not GPPS large subunit, might play a key role in regulating monoterpene biosynthesis (Tholl et al., <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Consistently, the AROS probes for GPPS large subunit genes (VIT_04s0023g01210 and VIT_18s0001g12000) were neither differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening nor correlated to any monoterpene. No probe could be identified for the GPPS small subunit.</p><p>Only three probes for terpene synthases are present on the Grape AROS V.1 array, which are not specific to any single gene prediction. One of them, showing the best match to the sesquiterpene synthases VIT_18s0001g04280 and VIT_18s0001g04530, was up-regulated during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>). It is worth noting that the same genes were reported to correlate with linalool and &#945;-terpineol (Savoi et al., <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>An interesting candidate gene for the biosynthesis of monoterpenes is a nudix hydrolase (VIT_10s0003g00880), whose expression increases along berry development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The corresponding probe belongs to cluster 4, which also harbors several monoterpenes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>). Recently, a rose nudix hydrolase was reported to convert geranyl diphosphate to geranyl monophosphate, which in turn is hydrolyzed to geraniol by a phosphatase activity (Magnard et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This alternative and completely new terpene synthase-independent route for monoterpene production might play a role also in other plants, including grapevine.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary monoterpene transformations</title><p>Extensive oxidative monoterpene metabolism has been reported in grapes and wine, with a percentage of linalool oxygenation ranging from 52 to 97% (Ilc et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). The main linalool oxidation products are <italic>trans</italic>/<italic>cis</italic>-8-hydroxy-linalool (by hydroxylation), <italic>trans</italic>/<italic>cis</italic> pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives or polyols like the odorless hydroxy-diendiol I and II (by epoxidation and hydrolysis). Similarly, C-8 oxygenated geraniol and citronellol derivatives can be formed through hydroxylation, whereas the oxidation to geranial and neral (altogether named citral) is supposedly mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases. Geranic acid is another oxidation product of geraniol. Rose oxide is generated from citronellol by allylic hydroxylation and acid-catalyzed cyclization. Citronellol in turn arises from the reduction of geraniol and nerol (hydrogenation).</p><p>Members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 71 and 76 families were recently shown to metabolize linalool in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Ginglinger et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; H&#246;fer et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Boachon et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, the CYP76 gene family has encountered an evident expansion in the grape genome (Nelson et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In order to identify genes potentially implicated in grape monoterpenoid metabolism we looked in VTCdb database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx">http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx</ext-link>) for CYP genes coexpressed with linalool synthases, as in Ginglinger et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This information was then added to our transcriptomic and metabolic integrated datasets. On this base, we propose some genes (VIT_15s0048g01490, VIT_15s0048g01590, VIT_18s0001g13790, VIT_00s0389g00030, VIT_00s0389g00040) and eventually additional ones as potential CYPs involved in linalool metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>). Most of these candidates have been never reported elsewhere, and thus deserve further attention. Conversely, VIT_15s0048g01490 and VIT_18s0001g13790 were recently characterized by Ilc et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) but their biochemical activity was only tested on a limited number of compounds. Our findings suggest instead that these genes might play a role in the production of a broader set of hydroxylated and/or epoxidized products as in other species (Meesters et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ginglinger et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; H&#246;fer et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Boachon et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and, even if the need for further oxidoreductases can not be excluded (Ilc et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>), they encourage to check this hypothesis by analyzing additional substrates (geraniol, nerol, citronellol) and products (e. g. pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides, hydroxy-diendiols, geranic acid, rose oxides) in CYP enzymatic assays. We also propose an epoxide hydrolase (VIT_04s0023g02610) to be assessed for involvement in monoterpene oxidative metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p><p>Based on their sequence similarity with terpenoid glucosyltransferases from different plant species and on their membership in biclusters harboring some glucosylated monoterpenes, we propose that VIT_03s0180g00200, VIT_03s0180g00320 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and eventually other genes reported in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref> (VIT_03s0091g00040, VIT_03s0180g00280, VIT_05s0062g00430, VIT_05s0062g00520, VIT_05s0062g00630, VIT_05s0062g00640) might code for enzymes that glucosylate monoterpenes along with additional metabolites. Most of these genes have been investigated in previous works but they were not considered as candidates for monoterpene glucosylation in view of their decreasing expression during berry development (Khater et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; B&#246;nisch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). However, they might be involved in the production of glucosylated monoterpenes with a similar trend, like the high oxidation state monoterpenoids sharing the same biclusters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>), which were not quantified in those papers. This hypothesis is not contradicted by the lack of gene annotation referring to the &#8220;Monoterpenoid biosynthesis&#8221; pathway and of positive correlation between transcript and monoterpenyl glucoside accumulation, as the same holds for the biochemically characterized monoterpenol glucosyltransferase <italic>VvGT7</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and may be explained by the broad substrate tolerance and overlapping enzymatic activities of the large GT family. Monoterpenyl glucosides are only intermediates within the glycosylation pathway and post-transcriptional control is additionally involved (B&#246;nisch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Monoterpene transport</title><p>Terpene transport within the cell and into the apoplast is an almost unexplored field. It may engage multiple pathways, e.g., (1) insertion of the hydrophobic terpenes into vesicle membranes followed by transport and fusion to the plasma membrane, (2) carrier proteins (like GSTs, glutathione S-transferases, and ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporters) that conduct these molecules to the (plasma) membrane, and (3) direct diffusion between the endoplasmic reticulum and/or plastidial (stromule) membranes and the plasma membrane (Ting et al., <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The fusion of vesicles with target membranes is mediated by a group of proteins called SNAREs (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors). Surprisingly and still without a clear underlying mechanism, both sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes were boosted when vesicle fusion was inhibited in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (Ting et al., <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, two <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> linalool synthases were detected in vesicular structures associated with the plastids (Ginglinger et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Based on these findings, we included among our candidates a gene coding for a SNARE associated Golgi protein (VIT_02s0012g01630). Plant ABCG transporters play a role in the flux of secondary metabolites, particularly of terpenoid origin (Kang et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Interestingly, we found an ABCG gene (VIT_16s0039g00010) that shows a profile consistent with monoterpene accumulation and is coexpressed with several monoterpene synthases in VTCdb. We also selected a glutathione S-transferase (VIT_08s0040g03040) and two amino acid permeases (VIT_06s0009g01140 and VIT_08s0007g05210), which are coexpressed with monoterpene biosynthetic genes in VTCdb and positively correlated to several monoterpenes in the present study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Monoterpene biosynthesis transcriptional regulation</title><p>Recent works (Cramer et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wen et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) suggested that a group of ERF6-type transcription factors clustered on chromosome 16 are involved in aroma accumulation, based on the correlation of their transcript abundance and the transcript abundance of several terpenoid pathway genes. For some of these regulatory genes, e.g., the orthologs of <italic>CrORCA2, CrORCA3</italic>, and <italic>AaERF1</italic> (De Geyter et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), no probe was found among the 4,450 probes used for our integrative analysis. Other <italic>ERF</italic> genes reported in the mentioned papers (VIT_16s0013g00950, VIT_16s0013g00980, VIT_16s0013g00990, VIT_16s0013g01030, VIT_16s0013g01050, VIT_16s0013g01060, not listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>) belonged to clusters 1, 2, 7 and did not show any relevant positive correlation with monoterpenes. However, some of the AROS probes had only a partial match with these genes, as a consequence they might correspond instead to <italic>ERF</italic> gene isoforms not involved in flavor determination. Conversely, the genes VIT_16s0100g00400 and VIT_18s0001g05250 showed an expression profile consistent with the accumulation of monoterpenes in Moscato Bianco ripening berry (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p><p>We also observed an interesting behavior (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>) for TFs of the MYB (VIT_14s0066g01090) and NAC (VIT_19s0014g03300) families that promote mono- and sequiterpene production in other plant species (Reeves et al., <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Nieuwenhuizen et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In particular, VIT_14s0066g01090 (<italic>MYB24</italic>) has been proposed as a candidate transcriptional regulator of (mono)terpene biosynthesis also in grapevine (Matus, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Savoi et al., <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), for which reason it deserves further attention. Finally, based on the negative effect of GBF1 (G-box binding factor 1) and ZCT (zinc-finger <italic>Catharanthus</italic> transcription factor) proteins on the expression of the TIA (terpenoid indole alkaloid) biosynthetic genes <italic>Str</italic> (strictosidine synthase) and <italic>Tdc</italic> (tryptophan decarboxylase) (Sib&#233;ril et al., <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Pauw et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), we selected two genes (VIT_15s0046g01440 and VIT_18s0001g09230) negatively correlated with monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p><p>One of the signals dramatically impacting isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants is light, which activates the MEP pathway at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (Rodr&#237;guez-Concepci&#243;n, <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Cordoba et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Vranov&#225; et al., <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mannen et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Sunlight exclusion limits the synthesis and accumulation of terpenes also in grape berries (linalool and the bound forms being the most responsive) by especially affecting <italic>DXS</italic> and <italic>TPS</italic> genes (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Friedel et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Joubert et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Matus, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Sasaki et al., <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our findings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>) are consistent with a role, among others, for <italic>HY5</italic> (<italic>LONG HYPOCOTYL5</italic>, VIT_04s0008g05210) in the regulation of light-induced terpenoid biosynthesis in grapes, in agreement with other evidences (Carbonell-Bejerano et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Loyola et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The isoprenoid pathway has also been reported to be under the circadian clock control.

Some probes on the AROS array correspond to a gene of the circadian oscillator (VIT_15s0048g02410) and fall into clusters harboring several monoterpenes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>).</p><p>The expression profile of a number of additional transcription factors (including master regulators) and genes potentially involved in the post-transcriptional regulation (Hemmerlin, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) overlaps monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening, which supports a role in the control of monoterpene biosynthesis for VIT_01s0026g01970, VIT_02s0012g01040, VIT_02s0012g01240, VIT_02s0234g00100, VIT_03s0038g02500, VIT_04s0023g00130, VIT_04s0023g01250, VIT_04s0023g02950, VIT_06s0004g07550, VIT_07s0031g01320, VIT_07s0031g01930, VIT_07s0104g01050, VIT_08s0007g05880, VIT_09s0054g01780, VIT_10s0003g03190, VIT_12s0028g03860, VIT_00s0214g00090, VIT_00s0463g00020 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9</xref>). To our knowledge, these genes represent new regulatory candidates for the production of several (cluster 4) or specific metabolites, like linalool (cluster 9) and geraniol/nerol (cluster 6), as suggested by their co-localization with QTLs and their correlation with enzyme/transporter genes correlated to metabolites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Integration of transcriptomic and metabolic data over multiple seasons to verify a subset of candidate genes</title><p>In order to confirm the above links between transcriptome and metabolome in aroma development, the 15 genes assessed by both microarray and real-time analyses were also tested for correlation with the metabolic profile over three seasons, which were considered as three biological replicates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12">S1A</xref>).
