</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of basic-helix-loop- helix leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There are three well-characterized SREBP isoforms in mammals: SREBP1A, SREBP1C and SREBP2 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>They are the master regulators of lipid homeostasis in the cells through controlling expression of over 30 genes, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), low-density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ATP citrate lysase and Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This list of SREBP target genes is continuously expanded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For an example, a recent report by Walker et al. revealed that S-adenosylmethionine synthetase type 1, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, methionine synthase and several other related genes were regulated by SREBP1 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Those SREBP target genes are required for biosynthesis of fatty acid, cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The activity of SREBP1A markedly increases the expression of genes involved in both cholesterol and fatty acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>SREBP1C demonstrates a slight selectivity, but lower activity, on fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>SREBP2 causes a preferential induction of genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>SREBPs are initially synthesized and are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as full-length precursor proteins (fSREBPs) forming a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and insulin induced gene (Insig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Upon receiving activation signals, the fSREBPs are transported to Golgi apparatus where they are cleaved sequentially by site 1 protease and site 2 protease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The newly-generated N-terminal fragments (nSREBPs) then translocate into nucleus, bind on both E-boxes and sterol regulatory elements within the promoter regions of their targets and stimulate lipogenic gene transcription [1], [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) is recognized as a Golgi-associated protein, although small levels of protein expression can be detected in cytoplasm, ER and mitochondria [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>During cell mitosis, the Golgi-associated section of ACBD3 is released into cytosol due to Golgi structure disintegration [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested this ubiquitously expressed protein plays several biological functions such as lipid metabolism, iron-related neurotoxicity, membrane trafficking, neuronal division, neurogenesis, development, and virus replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Through involving in protein kinase A-mediated signaling, ACBD3 facilitates cholesterol entry into mitochondria and thus steroidogenesis [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that ACBD3 bound with Dexras1 and DMT1 to enormously promote iron uptake in neurons, which contributed to the NMDA-induced excitotoxicity [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Through interacting with integral Golgi membrane protein giantin, ACBD3 is implicated in the structure maintenance of Golgi and ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>During mitotic Golgi fragmentation, ACBD3 was found to physically interact with Numb protein and functionally modulate Numb signaling, which is critical for neural progenitor cell's asymmetric division and neurogenesis [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Embryonic lethality of ACBD3 homozygous knockout mice indicates that this protein is critical for embryonic development [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies revealed that ACBD3 formed protein complexes with Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ and viral nonstructural proteins to regulate RNA replication of picornavirus in the host cells [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Many fatty acid-related lipid-binding proteins such as acyl-CoA binding domain containing proteins (ACBDs), fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), have been strongly implicated into lipid transport, metabolism, storage and signaling, which may influence membrane molecular composition, cellular energy homeostasis, and signal transduction within cells [8], [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Since ACBD3 contains an acyl CoA-binding domain at its N-terminus and is involved in steroid biosynthesis, and SREBP proteins are the regulators of lipid homeostasis in cells, we were interested to investigate whether ACBD3 plays a role in homeostasis of lipids, especially fatty acids, and how ACBD3 affects expression and function of SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we showed that overexpressed ACBD3 down-regulated the nuclear mature form of SREBP1 and inhibited its transcriptional activity, ultimately attenuating FASN expression and activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Since FASN is one SREBP1 target gene and an essential multi-function enzyme in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [18], we employed a luciferase reporter vector, encoding a sterol regulatory element (SRE)-containing FASN promoter sequence fused with firefly luciferase to assess how ACBD3 overexpression changed FASN promoter activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 1A, in the presence of overexpressed Myc-ACBD3, luciferase expression was dose- and time-dependently attenuated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours after transfection, FASN promoter activity was inhibited almost completely (94%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We decided to examine further whether ACBD3-mediated down-regulation of FASN promoter activity is modulated by SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We overexpressed full length SREBP1A and FASN reporter construct with or without ACBD3 and measured luciferase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We found that full-length SREBP1A-boosted FASN promoter activity was also significantly decreased by co-expressed ACBD3, suggesting this ACBD3-mediated inhibition of FASN promoter activity works through SREBP1 (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The results in Figure 2 show that in the empty-control cells growing under the lipid-depletion condition, endogenous expression of nuclear active SREBP1 was largely enhanced and correspondingly that of the membrane precursor form was significantly decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, lipid-repletion incubation gave rise to the opposite response for nuclear SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Those observations suggested that our lipid manipulation successfully initiated SREBP1 adaptative responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>When ACBD3-overexpressing cells were exposed to the lipid-deprivation condition, a prominent attenuation of the depletion-initiated SREBP1 feedback was observed, even though the upregulating trend of nSREBP still existed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Since the nuclear mature forms of SREBPs are responsible for their transactivation function to stimulate lipogenic gene transcription, we investigated whether ACBD3-mediated reduction of FASN reporter activity is due to a decrease in the levels of nSREBP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We overexpressed Myc-ACBD3 in HEK293T cells and examined expression levels of both unprocessed fSREBP and N-terminal nuclear active nSREBP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We found that, in the cell total lysate, overexpressed Myc-ACBD3 greatly down-regulated mature form (∼60 KDa) but up-regulated full-length form (∼120 KDa) of endogenous SREBP1 in HEK293T cells (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of GST- or GFP-tagged ACBD3 caused the identical regulation pattern of SREBP1 as the Myc-tagged protein did (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cell fractionation experiments (Figure 3B) showed that ACBD3 reduced the nuclear mature SREBP1 but increased the full-length membrane form in a dose-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Hence we wondered whether any of these domains specifically played a role in regulating SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>With the luciferase assay, it was shown that the deletion of the N-terminal region (1–171) in ACBD3 (ΔN) significantly attenuated ACBD3-mediated suppression of FASN promoter activity, (40% vs. 76%, Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This change pattern did not vary in the presence of overexpressed SREBP1A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Similarly, even though this mutant was found to disrupt the production of nuclear mature form of SREBP1, its disruptive effect was still smaller than that mediated by full-length ACBD3 (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, the other deletion mutant of ACBD3 without the C-terminal GOLD domain (ΔC) showed comparable inhibitory effect on SREBP1's maturation and transcriptional function as the full-length protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Our immunofluorescence confocal imaging studies revealed that most of the overexpressed full-length and ΔN ACBD3 proteins were localized on Golgi apparatus while C-terminal deletion (ΔC) largely lost this subcellular selectivity (Figure 5C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have identified lipid-binding protein ACBD3 as a new binding partner and maturation modulator of SREBP1, and demonstrated ACBD3's ability to influence de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids by regulating FASN and ACC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>These data significantly broaden our views on the biological roles played by ACBD3 and provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying how lipid-binding proteins affect lipid homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In cells, there are several families of lipid-binding proteins such as ACBDs, FATPs and FABPs, which function coordinately to regulate homeostasis and function of fatty acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Entry of free fatty acids into the cells can be mediated through either passively diffusing through cell membrane or actively uptaking by FATPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Intracellular fatty acids are then bound to either FABPs or ACBDs following conversion to fatty acyl-CoA esters by acyl-CoA synthetases [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In those forms of complexes with chaperone proteins, fatty acids may be transported to various cellular compartments for executing their multifaceted biological functions, such as to the ER for synthesis of biological membrane and more complex lipids, to mitochondria for generating ATP via β-oxidation, to the lumen of secretory pathway for membrane protein lipidation, to the nucleus for signaling lipid-mediated transcription, or to lipid droplets for energy storage as triglycerides [16], [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Considering their amphipathic physicochemical properties and complicated biological functions, fatty acyl-CoA esters need to be tightly regulated inside the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the ACBD family proteins, acting as intracellular acyl-CoA pool formers and transporters, play critical roles in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>ACBD1 (also known as Acyl-CoA Binding Protein or ACBP) is the prototypical ACBD family member and has been investigated most intensively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This 87-amino-acids protein, whose ACB domain covers its entire sequence, was found to bind with acyl-CoA ester with a Kd at a nanomolar level [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deficiency of this housekeeping gene resulted in embryonic lethality in mice, and siRNA-mediated ACBD1 knockdown in HepG2 cells initiated transcriptional changes on 22 genes related to cellular lipid metabolic process and caused significant reduction of palmitate content [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Observations that augmentation of muscular fatty acyl-CoA in obese Zucker rats was much higher than that of ACBD1 and that long-chain acyl-CoA esters activated ATP-sensitive potassium channels inhibiting β-cell excitability obviously implicated ACB-containing proteins in the development of obesity and diabetes [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Lipid-regulating function of ACBD3, however, was found so far to be restricted to cellular steroidogenesis that occurred in mitochondria [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Following hormone stimulation, PKA/cAMP-related signals initiated formation of a protein complex on the mitochondrial membrane, containing ACBD3, mitochondrial translocator protein, protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1a, ACBD1 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and subsequently mediated cholesterol transport into mitochondria, the rate-limiting step along the pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>According to the findings of the present study, biological functions of ACBD3 are expanded significantly into area of de novo lipogenesis to modulate fatty acid biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Due to the embryonic lethality induced by ACBD3 gene knockout in mice and the fundamental nature of fatty acids in cell survival, growth, proliferation and death, the physiological and pathological roles undertaken by ACBD3 appear to be more important and complicated than those currently recognized in the field. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Intracellular SREBPs can be modulated by different nutritional and hormonal cues at several levels, including transcription, translation, processing (maturation) and degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Intracellular processing of SREBP1A and SREBP2 could be stimulated by depletion of cellular sterol content [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, maturation of SREBP1A and SREBP1C could be inhibited by incubation with unsaturated fatty acids but promoted by blocking phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) production [4], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, expression and activation of SREBP1C is resistant to sterol deficiency but sensitive to feeding and treatment of insulin and other growth factors (as shown in Figure S5) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Following receptor activation by growth factors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B)-mediated signaling pathway seems to play a dominant role in activating SREBP1 (intensively reviewed in [34]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>SREBP processing and activity appears to also be sensitive to a variety of stressful stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal injury has been also linked to increased activity of SREBP1 by augmented Insig1 degradation [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Similarly, via depleting Insig1, both ER stress inducers and hypotonic stress inducers were found to promote proteolytic processing of SREBPs [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Under fasting condition, activation of glucagons/cAMP/PKA signaling cascade caused direct phosphorylation at two consensus PKA recognition sites located in the ligand binding/heterodimerization domain of LXRα and concomitantly suppression of SREBP1C gene transcription [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies demonstrated that Sirtuin 1, a key NAD+-dependent deacetylase involved in calorie restriction (CR)-mediated lifespan extension, directly deacetylate both SREBP1 and SREBP2, enhancing their ubiquitination and thus decreasing their stability [39], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Together, all of these observations indicated that SREBP-regulated lipogenic pathway represents a fundamental adaptation mechanism, which is critical for cells to response to their dynamically-changed living environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Our results in Figure 3B and S1A clearly showed dose-dependent reduction of nuclear SREBP1 (nSREBP1) and the corresponding enhancement of membrane form (fSREBP1) at 48 hours after ACBD3 vector transfection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it was displayed that ACBD3 physically bound with fSREBP1 but not nSREBP1 (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, our results excluded possibility that ACBD3-inhibited SREBP1 maturation is due to ACBD3's disturbing effect on the physical interaction among SREBP1-SCAP-Insig1 (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly implicated that ACBD3, via binding with a non-N-terminal domain of fSREBP1 on the Golgi membrane (Figure 5C), blocks a process of S1P/S2P-mediated proteolytic cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Considering ACBD3's putative inhibitory function on ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking [11], SREBP1 transfer from the ER to Golgi may be also disrupted in the presence of overexpressed ACBD3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Owing to the well-conserved proteolytic processing steps among the three SREBP family members, it is probable that ACBD3 might exert a similar impact on SREBP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In fact, we have observed that (Figures S1 and S2) that manipulation of ACBD3 induced similar impact on SREBP2 as those of SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is unlikely that ACBD3 directly regulates nSREBP1 post-translational modification, degradation and/or transactivation capacity because of their undetectable physical interaction (Figure 4), the ACBD3-induced upregulation of fSREBP1 (Figures 3B and S1A), and significantly different subcellular localization (cytosol vs. nucleus). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>At 72 hours after transfection (Figure S1A), ACBD3 overexpressed from the lowest-dose transfection apparently boosted the fSREBP1, while those from higher-dose transfection largely downregulated the full-length protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy could be explained by SREBP1's auto-regulatory function and lag time between gene transcription, protein translation and degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>We might expect to see the reduced fSREBP1 if cells were allow to overexpress ACBD3 at the lowest level for longer duration than 72 hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This expectation was further supported by the observation that all three different levels of overexpressed ACBD3 promoted the expression of fSREBP1 at 48-hours time point. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the different responsiveness of FASN and ACC to ACBD3 overexpression at 48 and 72 hours following transfection (Figure 6C) could also be attributed to the lag time between transcription inhibition and protein turnover of FASN and ACC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>At 48 hours after transfection, pre-existing FASN and ACC seemed to contribute to the irresponsiveness even though nSREBP1 was down-regulated (Figure S1A) and transcription of the two target genes was inhibited (Figure 6A and 6B) at this point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>With the prolonged ACBD3 overexpression (72 hr after transfection), significant amounts of the pre-existing proteins were degraded and there was no enough newly-synthesized proteins to compensate in the system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>As a result, dose-dependent decreases of steady-state FASN and ACC were displayed under this prolonged expression condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>These findings were in accord with the results from experiments quantifying de novo palmitate synthesis (Figure 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Palmitate production was significantly reduced only when ACC and FASN protein levels were decreased. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Utilizing molecular and biochemical approaches (Figure 5), we found that N-terminal domain (residues 1–171) of ACBD3 played an important role in its inhibitory function on the intracellular processing and transcriptional activity of SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This observation implied that the ACB domain (residues 80–171), accounting for more-than-half portion of the deleted N-terminal sequence, might be required for ACBD3 to modulate SREBP1 activation to highest extent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Moreover, confocal imaging results showed that the ΔN mutant still localized mainly on the Golgi just like the full-length wildtype, indicating that Golgi association was not sufficient for its maximum inhibitory function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This observation, from a different perspective, supported the concept that ACB domain might involve in ACBD3-mediated SREBP1 regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, deletion of C-terminal GOLD domain did not disrupt ACBD3's function to inhibit SREBP1 activity, revealing that these residues (381–526) were not required for its effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, unlike full-length and ΔN ACBD3, this ΔC mutant is localized more diffusely and only a small portion appeared to be located on the Golgi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Based on this finding, we still could not exclude the possibility that Golgi association contributes to ACBD3's effects on SREBP1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>As one master lipid regulator, Akt/mTORC1-regulated SREBP function is apparently fundamental for maintaining structure and energy homeostasis of cells, determining cell survival and growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it is not surprising that altered SREBP expression and activity have been implicated in imbalanced lipid metabolism during the development of many dyslipidemic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cancer, neurodegeneration, and schizophrenia [18], [19], [41]–[44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Thus, measures to curtail lipogenic function of SREBPs have displayed therapeutic potentials on different disorders involving imbalanced lipid metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Metformin, a widely-used AMPK activator in clinics for type 2 diabetes, was reported to ameliorate fatty liver by reducing mRNA and nuclear protein of SREBP1 [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Through facilitating physical SCAP-Insig1 interaction, small molecule betulin inhibited SREBP maturation and subsequently attenuated target gene transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Betulin administration improved the lipid profiles and insulin resistance in mice fed with Western-diet and antagonized atherosclerotic lesion formation in LDLR-deficient mice [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Due to established roles of FASN overexpression in tumor growth and malignancy, targeting on fatty acid de novo synthesis for cancer therapy had been intensively explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Direct FASN inhibition by its selective inhibitors was one of the most popular interventions to be tested under various in vitro and in vivo settings, and many supportive results were reported [47]–[50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Apparently, discoveries of novel signaling pathways that regulate lipid metabolism via controlling SREBP transcription, expression and maturation are desirable from not only basic but also clinical perspectives. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The present study undoubtedly revealed that ACBD3 overexpression reduced SREBP1 maturation, transactivation ability, and ultimately, fatty acid de novo synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, with an extensively-employed cell model of SREBP regulation, ACBD3 demonstrated its potential to control cellular lipid homeostasis (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Considering the multifaceted cellular functions of lipids, these observations suggest that ACBD3 may have many unappreciated lipid-related functions in various cells and that it would be a feasible measure to manipulate ACBD3 expression and function for modulating many SREBP1-involved physiopathological conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first report showing a physical and functional connection between a lipid-binding protein (ACBD3) and a master lipid regulator (SREBPs). </plain></SENT>
