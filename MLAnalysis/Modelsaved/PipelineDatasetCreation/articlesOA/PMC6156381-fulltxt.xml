The fibrates and thiazolidinediones are synthetic PPAR agonists used clinically to treat dyslipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, respectively, but also improve symptoms of several other diseases. Transposable elements (TEs), repetitive sequences in mammalian genomes, are implicated in many of the same conditions for which PPAR agonists are therapeutic, including neurodegeneration, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. We tested the hypothesis that there is a link between actions of PPAR agonists and TE expression. We developed an innovative application of microarray data by mapping Illumina mouse WG-6 microarray probes to areas of the mouse genome that contain TEs. Using this information, we assessed the effects of systemic administration of three PPAR agonists with different PPAR subtype selectivity: fenofibrate, tesaglitazar, and bezafibrate, on TE probe expression in mouse brain [prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala] and liver. We found that fenofibrate, and bezafibrate to a lesser extent, up-regulated probes mapped to retrotransposons: Short-Interspersed Elements (SINEs) and Long-Interspersed Elements (LINEs), in the PFC. Conversely, all PPAR agonists down-regulated LINEs and tesaglitazar and bezafibrate also down-regulated SINEs in liver. We built gene coexpression networks that partitioned the diverse transcriptional response to PPAR agonists into groups of probes with highly correlated expression patterns (modules). Most of the differentially expressed retrotransposons were within the same module, suggesting coordinated regulation of their expression, possibly by PPAR signaling. One TE module was conserved across tissues and was enriched with genes whose products participate in epigenetic regulation, suggesting that PPAR agonists affect TE expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Other enriched functional categories included phenotypes related to embryonic development and learning and memory, suggesting functional links between these biological processes and TE expression. In summary, these findings suggest mechanistic relationships between retrotransposons and PPAR agonists and provide a basis for future exploration of their functional roles in brain and liver.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd><kwd>PPAR</kwd><kwd>psychiatric</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000027</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">AA024332</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">AA021462</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">AA017234</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="111"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, are ligand-activated transcription factors. There are three PPAR isotypes: PPAR&#945;, PPAR&#947; and PPAR&#946; (sometimes called PPAR&#948;) with distinct expression patterns, tissue distribution, and ligand specificity (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Grygiel-Gorniak, 2014</xref>). PPAR&#945; is most highly abundant in metabolically active tissues including liver, heart, intestine, and kidney, PPAR&#947; is most abundant in adipose tissue, and PPAR&#946;/&#948; is ubiquitously expressed, often at relatively higher levels than PPAR&#945; or PPAR&#947; (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kliewer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Braissant et al., 1996</xref>). All PPAR isotypes are expressed in brain, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala, and appear to be most highly expressed in neurons (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Moreno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Warden et al., 2016</xref>). Their main function is to regulate fatty acid metabolism but also have roles in inflammation, glucose metabolism, adipogenesis and myelination [for review, see (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi et al., 2011</xref>)]. Fibrates are PPAR&#945; agonists used to treat dyslipidemia, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are PPAR&#947; agonists used to treat type 2 diabetes, and the glitazars are dual PPAR&#945; and PPAR&#947; agonists used to treat dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes comorbidities. Although PPAR&#946; /PPAR&#948; agonists are not used clinically, they have been used as performance enhancers by athletes and have been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are repeating genomic elements that have the ability to translocate across the genome. First discovered by Barbara McClintock in maize in the 1940s, TEs have been found across different taxonomic groups. They can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the host. They can drive diversity and evolution through their role as controlling elements that can lead to novel regulation of genes, but they can also drive disease through their role as insertional mutagens [for review, see (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>)]. Many TEs are conserved across species including fruit flies, rodents and humans, where they are estimated to make up almost half of the genome (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Nellaker et al., 2012</xref>). TEs can be divided into two major classes: DNA transposons that translocate via a cut-and-paste method (but are not mobile in mammals), and retrotransposons that translocate via a copy-and-paste method using an RNA intermediate. Retrotransposons can be further subdivided into categories based on whether or not they contain Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs, e.g., endogenous retroviruses - ERVs). Retrotransposons lacking LTRs include Long-Interspersed Elements (LINEs), Short-Interspersed Elements (SINEs), Alu and SVA elements. For more information on different classes of TEs the interested reader is referred to reviews (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Muotri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although representing a large portion of the genome in different species, most TE sequences are non-functional and cannot move in the genome. The host uses sophisticated epigenetic mechanisms to create highly condensed heterochromatin to regulate TE expression (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of retrotransposon expression occurs through extensive DNA methylation at retrotransposon promoter sequences [reviewed in (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Yoder et al., 1997</xref>)]. However, retrotransposons can be expressed when the epigenetic silencing is released (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>). For example, one study linked hypomethylated genomic areas with increased expression of LTRs in human alcoholic frontal cortex compared to controls (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>), another study linked hypomethylation with increased activation of ERVs in mouse tumors (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2008</xref>), and another found that cocaine-mediated reductions of a heterochromatic marker (H3K9me3) were associated with increased LINE-1 expression in mouse nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Transposable elements have been implicated in many pathological conditions, including approximately 100 single-gene diseases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Hancks and Kazazian, 2012</xref>), such as hemophilia A (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Sukarova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ganguly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2008</xref>), and cystic fibrosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Retrotransposons (ERVs and LINE1 elements) have also been linked to more complex diseases including diabetes (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Pascual et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2008</xref>), cancers [for review, see (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns, 2017</xref>)], and several psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Guffanti et al., 2014</xref>), such as alcohol and cocaine addiction (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>), autism (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Balestrieri et al., 2012</xref>), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Balestrieri et al., 2014</xref>), depression (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Weis et al., 2007</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Yolken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Weis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Perron et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bundo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Slokar and Hasler, 2015</xref>), bipolar disorder (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Yolken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Weis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Perron et al., 2012b</xref>), post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Rusiecki et al., 2012</xref>), Rett syndrome (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Muotri et al., 2010</xref>), and neurodegeneration (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cartault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Besides their clinical uses for dyslipidemia and diabetes, PPAR agonists have shown therapeutic potential (mostly preclinical evidence) for several brain diseases including neurodegeneration (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bordet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barbiero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Fidaleo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Avagliano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dickey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Makela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Wang Y. et al., 2017</xref>), mood disorders (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Kemp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Scheggi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Colle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al., 2018</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>), and several types of substance use disorders (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Melis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Stopponi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Panlilio et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Le Foll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Stopponi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Karahanian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blednov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">de Guglielmo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Haile and Kosten, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Meza et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, PPAR agonists and TEs are clinically related, i.e., are associated with similar diseases. The rationale for this study is based on this clinical relatedness; we reasoned that because PPAR agonists and TEs are associated with many of the same diseases that their mechanisms of action could be interacting. Here, we tested the hypothesis that activation of PPARs regulates transcriptional activity of TEs. We mapped Illumina microarray probes to genomic locations that correspond to different classes of TEs and used this information to study the effects of PPAR agonists on expression of TEs in the amygdala, PFC, and liver of male C57Bl/6J mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and Drug Administration</title><p>We previously measured the effects of peripherally administered PPAR agonists on brain and liver gene expression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2014</xref>).

A probe was considered to be targeting a TE region only if it falls completely within an annotated TE region. We constructed four TE data sets covering the major TE classes: DNA transposons, long-term repeat (LTR), long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE). <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold> contains the list of Illumina probes mapped to each TE class.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical and Gene Network Analyses</title><p>Data from each tissue were analyzed separately.

Many brain disorders are associated with up-regulation of TEs and little is known about TE function in brain, let alone the pharmacological regulation of TE expression patterns. We developed an innovative application of microarray data by mapping array probes to areas of the mouse genome that contain TEs. This enabled us to observe the effects of PPAR agonist administration on the expression of 4 TE classes in mouse brain and liver and make novel hypotheses regarding TE behavior in these tissues. Given the widespread clinical use of PPAR agonists, these findings have potential implications for a significant proportion of the population.</p><p>There are a number of ways that TEs can affect biological functions. For example, TEs can modify genomic architecture via insertional mutagenesis or post-insertional rearrangements [reviewed in (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Goodier and Kazazian, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Guffanti et al., 2014</xref>)]. TEs can also regulate the expression of other genes by introducing transcription start sites, inducing heterochromatization, or interfering with transcription via intron retention, exonization, or polyadenylation [reviewed in (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Cowley and Oakey, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Guffanti et al., 2014</xref>)]. Although LINEs are more mobile in brain versus other somatic tissue (e.g., skin) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), retrotransposition events are relatively rare, estimated to occur in caudate and cortical human neurons (postmortem) or neural progenitor cells (<italic>in vitro</italic>) at a rate of 1 in 100 to 1 in 10,000 insertion events per neuron or neural progenitor (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the differentially expressed TEs we observed are retrotransposed and inserted into the genome, and it is still unclear if new insertions can occur in postmitotic neurons. Although our findings are observational, and the downstream effects of the changes in TE expression after PPAR agonist treatment and the exact molecular mechanisms by which PPAR agonists modulate TE expression remain unknown, these findings suggest a novel relationship between TEs and PPAR agonists.</p><p>Gene-gene coexpression network analysis clusters genes that perform similar biological tasks or act in similar pathways, which allowed us to propose &#8220;guilt-by-association&#8221; relationships and to hypothesize either regulation or/and functional roles of TEs based on the known functions of other genes within the same module. It is important to note that enrichment analyses are used to generate hypotheses, and future experiments are required to determine how PPAR agonists regulate TE expression and any potential downstream consequences of the observed TE expression changes. In addition to being enriched with probes that are down-regulated by tesaglitazar, the probes within the conserved TE module were also enriched with LINEs, SINEs, and LTRs in both brain areas and LINEs and SINEs in liver, as well as genes related to epigenetic modification. It is known that epigenetic modifications are important for host regulation of TEs [for example, see (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2016</xref>)]. We found several members of the Kr&#252;ppel-associated box zinc finger protein family (Zfp445, Zfp612, Zfp551, Zfp52), in the conserved TE module in both brain areas (amygdala: green, PFC: tan), which are known to play a repressive role in transposition (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). The chromatin remodeler, Chd1, and the lysine methyltransferase, Ehmt1, were also in the conserved TE module, and both have been shown to rather specifically repress retrotransposons due to their importance in heterochromatin formation (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Maksakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, the change in expression after PPAR agonist treatment was the same for these repressive marks and the retrotransposons in these modules, which is opposite of what would be expected. However, it could be that the changes in the heterochromatin marks are a compensatory mechanism in response to changes in TE expression. In other words, if TE expression is increased, the cell will try to inhibit TE expression by increasing expression of repressive epigenetic factors.</p><p>The relationship between chromatin modifications and TE expression has also been observed in addiction. In the first study to suggest that TEs play a functional role in AUD, Ponomarev and colleagues used postmortem brains of alcoholic and control cases to show that chronic alcohol abuse resulted in transcriptional activation of LTR-containing transposons accompanied by DNA hypomethylation in their promoters (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>). It was shown in mice that repeated cocaine exposure decreases heterochromatic histone methylation (H3K9me3) binding and removes epigenetic silencing of LINE-1 elements in the nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>). The role of PPARs in drug dependence is reviewed in (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Le Foll et al., 2013</xref>), and is discussed below.</p><p>Actions of PPAR drugs have also been associated with epigenetic factors. There has been some exploration of the relationship between histone marks and PPARs/PPAR agonists. One study provides evidence that PPAR agonists can regulate epigenetic machinery (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, pioglitazone (a PPAR&#947; agonist) suppressed platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated cell proliferation by regulating Hdac1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). There is also evidence of the inverse relationship, that is, that histone marks regulate PPARs and response to PPAR agonists. Hdac5 is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus by fasting-induced rises in glucagon levels where it interacts with PPAR&#945; to promote its transcriptional activity, thereby mediating hepatic fatty acid oxidation by fasting and ER stress (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). The histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, Mll4/Kmt2d, directs overnutrition-induced murine steatosis via its coactivator function for PPAR&#947;2, whereby overnutrition activates Abl1 kinase which phosphorylates PPAR&#947;2, and hence has enhanced interaction with Mll4 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). DNA methylation status of certain CpGs in CD4 + T cells is associated with the inflammatory response in people undergoing a 3-week fenofibrate treatment in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study (<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Yusuf et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, Dnmt1, a maintenance enzyme responsible for <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, regulates the methylation status of the PPAR&#947; promoter in macrophages, where more Dnmt1 correlates with less PPAR&#947; gene expression levels in atherosclerosis patients&#8217; monocytes (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Given the evidence for a relationship between chromatin marks, and both PPARs, and TE expression, the strong, clear relationship we observed from our network analysis between TEs, epigenetic regulators, and PPAR agonist-regulated genes supports our approach and serves as a starting point to guide future experiments exploring the epigenetic control and the biological significance of TEs.</p><p>Our findings have two potential implications and interpretations. One possibility is that PPAR agonists are regulating TE expression levels through a PPAR-dependent transcriptional response (i.e., binding of PPARs and associated complexes to DNA in TE promoter regions). Another possibility is that PPAR agonists are regulating TE expression levels in an indirect manner, possibly by modifying the epigenetic landscape. The coexpression of TEs, epigenetic regulators, and PPAR agonist-regulated genes suggests a means by which PPAR agonist administration could affect TE expression. Namely that fenofibrate could increase TE expression by a &#8220;passive&#8221; release of chromatin-mediated gene silencing, similarly to what was observed for repeated alcohol and cocaine exposure (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ponomarev et al., 2012</xref>). Another line of evidence supports a PPAR-independent effect of PPAR agonist administration on TE expression levels; fenofibrate and bezafibrate, but not tesaglitazar, up-regulated SINEs in PFC. Considering that all of the PPAR agonists in this study target PPAR&#945;, it is possible that some of the observed effects on TE expression are off target (meaning they are not mediated directly by PPAR activation). Other off target effects of PPAR agonists have been noted. For example, some of the insulin-sensitizing benefits of PPAR-&#947; agonists are due in part to their ability to block phosphorylation and not solely to their agonist activity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2010</xref>). It will be important for future experiments to investigate the effects of PPAR agonist administration on TE expression in PPAR&#945; knockout mice to determine whether these effects on TE expression are mediated through PPAR&#945;.</p><p>In our study, the directionality of TE expression indicated that fenofibrate and bezafibrate up-regulated SINEs and LINEs in PFC and down-regulated them in liver. Superficially, the finding in the PFC seems contradictory (i.e., if PPAR agonists are anti-addictive they should <italic>decrease</italic>, not increase, TEs). We probed the transcriptional response at only a single time point. Therefore, it is possible that we are measuring a compensation for decreased TEs. It could also be that the effect of tesaglitazar was masked when analyzing the full list of differentially expressed genes and TEs, because a downregulation by tesaglitazar was linked to retrotransposons by the network analysis. Another interpretation is that, similarly to TEs, PPAR agonists have both beneficial and detrimental potential. Outside of their clinical uses of improving lipid and glycemic control, PPAR agonists have other therapeutic effects, but not unaccompanied by deleterious side effects. For example, PPAR agonists can be anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective and caridoprotective (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Staels et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Youssef and Badr, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Kim, 2015</xref>), but they can also lead to edema, weight gain, and hepatocellular and bladder carcinoma, to name a few (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Given the fact that increased expression of TEs can be a mark of genomic instability and lead to a number of diseases via genomic rearrangements and changes in gene expression regulation, perhaps some of PPARs deleterious effects are mediated though their up-regulation of TEs. Thus one consideration emerging from our study is that it might be prudent to test and observe a drug&#8217;s effects on TEs as an indication of possible negative effects on the patient, especially in cases where the drug is known to alter chromatin state.</p><p>In summary, we found evidence that PPAR agonist administration can modulate retrotransposon expression levels. This is one of only a few studies to demonstrate pharmacological regulation of TEs expression. We provide a basis for further study of the mechanisms and functional consequences of increased or decreased retrotransposon expression in brain and liver after PPAR agonist administration. Understanding whether PPAR agonists are mediating deleterious effects through retrotransposons could lead to the development of treatments with improved safety profiles. More broadly, this information could lead to a better understanding of and novel treatment strategies for the many psychiatric and neurological disorders that are associated with differential expression of retrotransposons.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LF, LZ, SW, CB, RH, and IP substantially contributed to the design of the work, the acquisition, analysis, and/or interpretation of data.
