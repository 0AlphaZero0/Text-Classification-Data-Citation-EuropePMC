The distribution of the receptor has been thus far mapped only in the rat central nervous system. This study was undertaken to map the distribution of GPR30 in the mouse brain and rodent peripheral tissues. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against GPR30 revealed high levels of GPR30 immunoreactivity (ir) in the forebrain (e.g. cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus), specific nuclei of the midbrain (e.g. the pontine nuclei and locus coeruleus) and the trigeminal nuclei and cerebellum Purkinje layer of the hindbrain in the adult mouse brain. In the rat and mouse periphery, GPR30-ir was detected in the anterior, intermediate and neural lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation histochemistry using GPR30 riboprobes, revealed intense hybridisation signal for GPR30 in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus, anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary of both rat and mouse. Double immunofluorescence revealed GPR30 was present in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurones of the paraventricular nucleus and SON of the rat and mouse brain. The distribution of GPR30 is distinct from the other traditional ERs and offers an additional way in which oestrogen may mediate its effects in numerous brain regions and endocrine systems in the rodent.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Oestrogen (17-&#946;-oestradiol or E<sub>2</sub>) affects a variety of physiological processes including fertility, immune function, cardiovascular homeostasis, mood, locomotion, neuroprotection and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Watson &amp; Gametchu 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McEwan 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">de Ronde <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). E<sub>2</sub> effects are typically mediated through two structurally related oestrogen receptors, the &#945; and &#946; (ER&#945; and ER&#946;) subtypes that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. On activation ERs can either bind directly to their target DNA sequences in the nucleus or interact with other nuclear proteins to alter gene activation, and this genomic action occurs slowly (hours&#8211;days). However, it is well documented that E<sub>2</sub> can also provoke many fast &#8216;non-genomic&#8217; effects e.g. activation of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (K<sub>ca</sub>1&#183;1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valverde <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>), and these could be mediated by extranuclear ERs or by non-classical membrane bound receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levin 2005</xref>).</p><p>GPR30, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) specifically binds E<sub>2</sub> with high (nanomolar) affinity and evokes rapid effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Revankar <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>), including stimulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilisation from intracellular stores directly or via epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation, <italic>c-fos</italic> expression, adenylyl cyclase and cAMP mediated signalling and ERK-1/2 in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prossnitz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, only a small fraction of total cellular GPR30 appears to be expressed on the cell surface with most of the receptor located intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Revankar <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). GPR30 acts as an atypical GPCR, in that, it is activated intracellularly by E<sub>2</sub> which readily diffuses across cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Revankar <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies in GPR30 knockout mice have indicated that GPR30 mediates E<sub>2</sub> stimulated insulin release in females, reduces blood pressure and is involved in bone development, but is not essential for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">M&#229;rtensson <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otto <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In addition, GPR30 is expressed in oxytocin (OXT) neurones of the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), implicating a role for GPR30 in the fast, non-genomic actions of E<sub>2</sub> on OXT release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Revankar <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>).

A role for E<sub>2</sub> in regulating OXT and/or AVP release is supported by studies showing that administration of E<sub>2</sub> to postmenopausal women increases circulating levels of OXT and AVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bossmar <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>), and E<sub>2</sub> rapidly stimulates intrahypothalamic and peripheral OXT and possibly AVP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burbach <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>).</p><p>As GPR30 provides an alternative model for E<sub>2</sub> signalling, and possibly E<sub>2</sub> stimulated release of OXT and AVP, the present study was undertaken to clarify the distribution of GPR30 in the rodent.

It has been reported that GPR30 is also found on the plasma membrane where it appears to be functionally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filardo <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Further studies on GPR30 internalisation and trafficking are required to address this issue. The suggestion that a GPCR is primarily localised intracellulary is not without precedent- e.g. the proportion of human GnRH receptors at the cell surface is extremely low (&lt;1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finch <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>) and depends upon the cellular context (the proportion of human GnRH receptors at the cell surface is five times greater in a gonadotroph cell line (L&#946;T2) than MCF7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finch <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>)). Homologues of the human, rat and mouse GPR30 are present in many species including rhesus monkey, chimpanzee, dog, chicken and zebrafish (see NCBI or Ensembl databases at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</ext-link> respectively). The GPR30 gene is widely distributed in human and rat tissues as shown by northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Owman <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonini <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carmeci <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng &amp; Gregor 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kvingedal &amp; Smeland 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>) and see EST profile Hs.20961 in NCBI Entrez Gene database). We have extended these observations in the present study using immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation histochemistry to obtain the cellular context of GPR30 expression in mouse brain and peripheral tissues.</p><sec><title>Distribution of GPR30-ir in the adult mouse brain</title><p>The present study provides the first full comprehensive characterisation of GPR30 distribution in the mouse central nervous system. Previously, the distribution of GPR30 has been illustrated in the rat brain using the same GPR30 antiserum as described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). In agreement with our findings in mice, there are no apparent gender differences in GPR30 expression in the rat and this appears common to all E<sub>2</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laflamme <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> found predominant GPR30 expression in the hypothalamic PVH and SON, hippocampal formation, substantia nigra in the rat brain and this correlates well with our observations in the mouse brain. However, GPR30 is also highly expressed in the nucleus ambiguous where only low to moderate expression is found in the equivalent area in the mouse brain, suggesting some species differences. A comparison of GPR30 mRNA versus protein localisation in both rat and mouse brains may reveal whether receptor transcription and translation coincide or whether there are mismatches.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of ER distribution in the adult mouse brain</title><p>There appears to be only a few brain regions that express high levels of GPR30 and high amounts of either ER&#945; or ER&#946; and even fewer regions that express all three receptors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) to a high degree. For example, GPR30 is most abundant in the hypothalamus of the mouse, particularly the arcuate nucleus, PVH, periventricular nucleus, SON and the dorsomedial, central and ventrolateral regions of the VMH. Of these nuclei, ER&#945; is highly expressed in the arcuate nucleus and in the ventrolateral portion of the VMH, and in rats priming the VMH with E<sub>2</sub> over days promotes lordosis, seemingly through ER&#945; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfaff &amp; Sakuma 1978</xref>). In the rat and mouse, hypothalamus ER&#946; is the predominant ER isoform found in the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitra <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merchenthaler <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Interestingly, E<sub>2</sub> has been shown to activate the (MAPK) ERK 1/2 pathway in the PVH and SON of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">&#193;brah&#225;m <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). In the PVH, this is potentially mediated via either ER&#946; and/or GPR30, and presumably GPR30 in the SON.</p><p>In the forebrain, GPR30 is also highly expressed in the cingulate, motor and somatosensory regions of the isocortex, piriform cortex, the hippocampal dentate gyrus hilus, subiculum and entorhinal cortex, and the zona incerta where ER&#945; and ER&#946; expression is either low or absent. Interestingly, E<sub>2</sub> has been shown to induce c-<italic>fos</italic> protein expression in some brain regions (e.g. cingulate cortex) of double ER&#945;&#946; knockout mice. As GPR30 is abundant in this region, GPR30 or another E<sub>2</sub>-binding protein may mediate the effects of E<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominguez-Salazar <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). On the other hand, ER&#945; and &#946; are both highly expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the medial nucleus of the amygdala, where only minimal amounts of GPR30 can be detected.</p><p>In the midbrain and pons, high expression of GPR30 is found in the pontine nuclei, anterior tegmental nucleus, the medioventral periolivary nucleus and superior paraolivary nucleus of the superior olive, and the locus coeruleus. Of these, only the locus coeruleus contains high levels of the ERs. Interestingly in the mouse, noradrenaline neurones of the locus coeruleus have been shown to be responsive to E<sub>2</sub> stimulation with an upregulation in tyrosine hydroxylase transcription in females, and attenuation of transcription in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanky <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). This gender difference could be indicative of the varying roles of all the three ERs that are highly expressed in this brain region.</p></sec><sec><title>GPR30 co-localises with OXT and AVP neurones</title><p>The present study also aimed to clarify the inconsistencies in the literature regarding the distribution of GPR30 in hypothalamic magnocellular neurones. Our findings confirm that in the rat and mouse hypothalamus both OXT and AVP neurones express GPR30. This is in agreement with observations of Brailoiu <italic>et al</italic>. who found co-localisation of GPR30 with OXT and AVP in magnocellular neurones of the rat PVH and SON, but contrast with those of another study that detected GPR30 only in OXT neurones of the PVH and SON of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakamoto <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). The reasons for these discrepancies are not readily apparent, especially since all three studies used the same antiserum directed against the GPR30 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Revankar <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). To confirm the specificity of GPR30-ir in the present study we substituted normal rabbit IgG serum for primary antibody at the same concentration, and did not observe any staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>F).</p><p>E<sub>2</sub> mediates the release of OXT and AVP <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. It rapidly stimulates intrahypothalamic OXT and AVP release and rapid peripheral OXT and possibly AVP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burbach <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). In addition, E<sub>2</sub> inhibits the release of both peptides from hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants stimulated hyperosmotically via a non-genomic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swenson &amp; Sladek 1997</xref>) and rapidly alters the electrophysiological properties of OXT cells in the SON of lactating or morphine-dependent rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Israel &amp; Poulain 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). OXT and AVP neurones of the rat PVH and SON, express ER&#946; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hrabovszky <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). It is well established that ERs can stimulate second messenger pathways, perhaps via receptors tethered to the plasma membrane, as well as alter gene activation in the nucleus, suggesting that the rapid E<sub>2</sub> effects on OXT/AVP synthesis and release could be modulated through extranuclear ER&#946; at the level of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Razandi <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levin 2005</xref>). Alternatively, E<sub>2</sub> could regulate AVP and OXT neuronal activity by indirectly activating ER&#945;/&#946;-expressing neurones that project to the PVH and SON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shughrue <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hrabovszky <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sladek &amp; Somponpun 2004</xref>). The relative contribution of GPR30 in E<sub>2</sub> effects on hypothalamo-neurohypophysial activity is not known. However, ER&#946; immunoreactivity is absent from the neural lobe suggesting that E<sub>2</sub> does not directly mediate peripheral release of OXT and AVP at the level of the pituitary via this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelletier <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). Interestingly in the present study, we found high levels of GPR30-ir in the neural lobe, indicating that E<sub>2</sub> could modulate the peripheral release of OXT and AVP through GPR30 signalling. As we were unable to detect GPR30 mRNA in the neural lobe, it can be assumed that the receptor had been transported, presumably from the magnocellular neurones in the PVH and SON, as we also observed co-localisation of GPR30 with OXT and AVP fibres in the internal zone of the median eminence. It is possible that GPR30 regulates OXT and AVP synthesis in PVH and SON magnocellular cell bodies, and/or modulates OXT and AVP release from PVH and SON magnocellular neurone dendrites or from fibres that terminate in the posterior pituitary. Our studies also suggest that GPR30 could mediate E<sub>2</sub> effects on the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary adrenal axis by modulating the release of OXT, AVP or perhaps CRF into portal blood from neurones originating from the parvocellular region of the PVH.</p></sec><sec><title>Peripheral distribution of GPR30</title><p>The present study demonstrates high expression of GPR30 mRNA and protein in the pituitary gland, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary of the rat and mouse. There is a strong correlation between the tissue distribution of both GPR30 mRNA and protein, apart from that in the neural lobe of the pituitary.</p><p>While GPR30 protein is expressed in all three lobes of the pituitary with the highest mRNA expression was observed in the intermediate lobe. ER&#945; and ER&#946; are also expressed in the anterior and intermediate lobes, but are absent from the posterior lobe of the pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchner <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelletier <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonz&#225;lez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). It is well established that the anterior pituitary is a target tissue for E<sub>2</sub>, regulating gonadotrophin and prolactin (PRL) secretion from gonadotrophs and lactrotrophs, and this response can be rapid, with E<sub>2</sub> increasing excitability in PRL-secreting pituitary cell lines within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufy <italic>et al</italic>. 1979</xref>). High expression of GPR30 mRNA and protein in the intermediate lobe and the presence of the traditional E<sub>2</sub> receptors suggests a possible role for E<sub>2</sub> in pro-opiomelanocortin synthesis and &#945;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH) and ACTH-like peptide release. A previous study has shown that E<sub>2</sub> stimulates the release of &#945;-MSH from the intermediate lobe which in turn appears to exert a rapid stimulatory effect on PRL secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellerkmann <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the present study, GPR30 has been reported to be strongly expressed in the zona glomerulosa and the medulla of the human adrenal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquedano <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). The fast effects of E<sub>2</sub> have previously been described in primary cultures of bovine adrenal medullary cells with an up regulation in catecholamine synthesis within 20&#8202;min of E<sub>2</sub> stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yanagihara <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). This suggests a role for GPR30 in E<sub>2</sub> signalling either independently or synergisitically with extranuclear ER&#946; which is also expressed in cells of the rat adrenal cortex and medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the kidney, ER&#945;/&#946; are found mainly in the glomeruli and arterioles of the renal cortex where E<sub>2</sub> treatment has been shown to upregulate angiotensin type II receptors that regulate sodium and water reabsorption, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baiardi <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oestreicher <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). We found high expression of GPR30 mRNA and protein in the contracting muscle of the pelvis and to a moderate extent in the medulla. In the renal pelvis, the role of E<sub>2</sub> is presently unclear but there are suggestions that prolonged E<sub>2</sub> administration can encourage renal pelvic tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oberley <italic>et al</italic>. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adsay <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). In other carcinomas (e.g. breast, endometrial), GPR30 expression has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filardo <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that GPR30 is an alternative oestrogen responsive receptor in the production and maintenance of renal pelvic tumours.</p><p>E<sub>2</sub> has been shown to promote cell division and survival of granulosa cells in developing follicles of the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adashi 1994</xref>). E<sub>2</sub> also induces rapid (s) increases in cytosolic calcium concentration of human granulosa cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Younglai <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). While this could be mediated through the ER&#946; which has been shown to be highly expressed within the granulosa cells of developing follicles and corpora lutea of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>), our results also indicate a role for GPR30. GPR30 mRNA and protein have been found in both granulosa and theca cells of the hamster and expression is sensitive to cyclic changes in FSH and LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). It has also been suggested that GPR30 is required for primordial follicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). These observations have been appeared to contradict a recent report which concluded that GPR30 did not mediate E<sub>2</sub> responses in reproductive organs owing to the fertile phenotype of the GPR30 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otto <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In GPR30 knockout animals, the normal phenotypes in E<sub>2</sub> responsive tissues such as the ovary, uterus and mammary gland does not necessarily preclude the possibility that GPR30 binds E<sub>2</sub> <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, in the knockout model, ER&#945; and/or ER&#946; may compensate for the loss of GPR30 especially in tissues of co-expression where there is potential for receptor cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sirianni <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). In addition, it is well known that ER&#946; knockouts remain fertile; it is only the deletion of ER&#945; which appears to create the infertile phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker &amp; Korach 2004</xref>).</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, four papers relevant to the possible function of GPR30 in the brain and adrenal have been published online. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isensee <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> analysed the distribution of GPR30 using GPR30-LacZ reporter mice and found predominant expression in sub populations of cells in the cortex and the dentate gyrus of the brain, in the intermediate and anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and in the adrenal medulla. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, GPR30-ir is also highly expressed in regions of the cortex and in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse brain. Our results also confirm the presence of GPR30 mRNA in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary and the adrenal medulla. However, in contrast to our data that clearly demonstrate both GPR30 mRNA and protein in the PVH and SON, GPR30 was only identified in the hypothalamic vasculature and not neurones in the GPR30-LacZ reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isensee <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Xu <italic>et al</italic>. implicate a role for GPR30 in the rat hypothalamus based on the selective GPR30 agonist G-1 attenuating 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> signalling within the PVH. They also confirmed GPR30 expression in OXT neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Another recent study has shown that GPR30 may have been mediated E<sub>2</sub>-stimulated release of LHRH in primate neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noel <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). In the rodent brain, co-localisation of GPR30 with LHRH neurones or a possible role of GPR30 in E<sub>2</sub>-stimulated LHRH release has yet to be described. Finally, the expression of GPR30 in the adrenal medulla of the rat has been confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dun <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> with GPR30 located in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive chromaffin cells, further suggesting a likely role for GPR30 in E<sub>2</sub>-mediated noradrenaline release from the adrenal glands.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The distribution of GPR30 in the adult mouse brain appears distinct from ER&#945; and ER&#946; receptors and offers an additional site for E<sub>2</sub> action. The expression of GPR30 in OXT and AVP neurones in the PVH, SON and in the median eminence, and its presence in the pituitary gland provides a likely means by which E<sub>2</sub> can modulate fast &#8216;non-genomic&#8217; effects on these specific neuropeptide systems. In the periphery, GPR30 may be involved in multiple functions including hormone release and development. Whether E<sub>2</sub> initiates responses through GPR30 alone or in concert with the other E<sub>2</sub> receptors (e.g. in regions of co-expression) has yet to be investigated, but the cellular distribution of GPR30 in the brain and peripheral tissues provides a basis for further studies on E<sub>2</sub> mediated signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>G G J H is the recipient of a BBSRC PhD studentship.

(A) GPR30-ir in rat pituitary is prominent in the nerve terminals of the neural (posterior) lobe (NL) and is present in most melanotrophs of the intermediate lobe (IL) (e.g. indicated by arrows). GPR30-ir is also found in scattered (&#8764;50%) cells in the anterior pituitary (AP) lobe. Whether these represent endocrine cells (e.g. prolactotrophs and corticotrophs) was not determined.
