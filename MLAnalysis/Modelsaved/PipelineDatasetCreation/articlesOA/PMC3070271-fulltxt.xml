The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of a 1-month treatment with anakinra (2 mg/kg subcutaneous daily, maximum 100 mg) with a placebo between two groups each with 12 patients with SJIA. Response was defined by a 30% improvement of the paediatric American College of Rheumatology criteria for JIA, resolution of systemic symptoms and a decrease of at least 50% of both C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with baseline. After month 1 (M1), patients taking placebo were switched to anakinra. Secondary objectives included tolerance and efficacy assessment for 12 months, and analyses of treatment effect on blood gene expression profiling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At M1, 8/12 responders were receiving anakinra and 1 responder receiving placebo (p=0.003). Ten patients from the placebo group switched to anakinra; nine were responders at M2. Between M1 and M12, six patients stopped treatment owing to an adverse event (n=2), lack of efficacy (n=2) or a disease flare (n=2). Blood gene expression profiling at enrolment and at 6 months' follow-up showed one set of dysregulated genes that reverted to normal values in the clinical responders and a different set, including interferon (IFN)-inducible genes, that was induced by anakinra.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Anakinra treatment is effective in SJIA, at least in the short term.

Part 1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. At D1, eligible patients were randomised to receive either anakinra or placebo (1:1) from D1 to month 1 (M1) using a computer-generated random list. Patients were stratified by centres and randomisation was balanced across treatments and centres. The randomisation information included the randomisation number, the centre, the assigned treatment and the date of randomisation. Investigators, other caregivers, the patients and their parents remained blinded to the assigned treatment. The primary objective was to demonstrate a higher proportion of responders in group 1 than group 2. No immunosuppressive drugs or DMARDs were allowed during the trial.

Cytokine transcripts encoding IL1-&#946; and IL-6 were not differentially expressed, but oncostatin (OSM) and the negative regulator of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) transcripts were upregulated.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Changes in blood transcriptional signatures after 1 month</title><p>At M1, 522 transcripts were significantly changed in patients treated with anakinra but not in the placebo-treated group (supplementary table S3).

At D1, patients from both groups displayed fairly homogeneous modular expression patterns with significant upregulation of innate immunity and underexpression of adaptive immunity modules. Modules including myeloid linage (M1.5 and M2.6), neutrophil (M2.2) and inflammation (M3.2 and 3.3) related transcripts were upregulated. Modules associated with erythrocytes (M2.3) and platelets (M1.2) were also upregulated. Conversely, modules containing transcripts related to lymphoid/T-cell lineage (M2.8 and M3.8), B cells (M1.3), T cells (M1.4) and cytotoxic cells (M2.1) were downregulated. At M1, several modular alterations were corrected in the anakinra-treated patients who responded to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Of the four non-responders, one patient was later diagnosed with Crohn's disease and blood from another patient was not properly collected; the two other patients did not show dysregulation of the modules at baseline and remained the same at M1. The modular alterations corrected in responders include transcripts within the platelet (M1.2), cytotoxic (M2.1) and erythropoiesis (M2.3) modules. None of these modules changed in the placebo group, therefore supporting the validity of the data at D1. We also observed the coordinated upregulation of type I IFN-inducible transcripts (M3.1) in the anakinra- but not in the placebo-treated group.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Modular analysis.

However, a loss of response was observed in most patients over time.</p><p>The efficacy of anakinra treatment in SJIA, at least in the short term, concorded with previous reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> However, the only other placebo-controlled trial testing anakinra in JIA showed no significant improvement versus placebo,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> illustrating that marked response to IL-1 inhibition is not characteristic of all JIA subtypes. The lack of sustained response in several patients may have been related to several factors. First, most patients had diffuse polyarthritis at enrolment but no fever; as previously reported,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> anakinra seemed less effective on the arthritis than on systemic features. Second, PK data suggested that low-weight children might have benefited from a higher anakinra dosage. Third, we included patients with active SJIA, steroid-dependency and a minimal disease duration of 6 months, therefore difficult to treat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>; loss of responses may have been favoured by the study design that precluded the use of associated DMARDs and allowed tapering of the corticosteroid dose at an early stage, a strategy designed to minimise the risk of treatment-related complications.</p><p>This study has limitations owing to the small number of patients and the short duration of the double-blind phase. In particular, we were unable to properly assess which patients' characteristics might predict response to treatment. In recent reports, the absence of small joint involvement, a smaller number of joints with active disease and an increased absolute neutrophil count were reported to be predictive of response to anakinra.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>No severe infections occurred in this trial and anti-pneumococcal Ab response was not affected by anakinra treatment. However, severe infections have been reported under anakinra in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> One patient here was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, a complication reported in some patients initially diagnosed with JIA and treated with anti-TNF agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> An additional patient experienced a sudden rise in serum transaminases. In order to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of anakinra in SJIA, further studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up need to be implemented.</p><p>As expected, the ex vivo genomic analysis of patient blood at D1 showed upregulation of transcripts related to innate immunity and haematopoiesis (supplementary table S2). Although several hereditary and sporadic IL-1&#946;-mediated diseases involve alterations in NLRP3 inflammasome components,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> no altered expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related transcripts was observed. However, two different flagellin receptors (CARD12 and TLR5) were significantly upregulated in the majority of patients at D1 (supplementary table S2) and normalised in the responder group at M6 (supplementary table S5). Whether the triggering of flagellin receptors is involved in the pathogenesis of SJIA remains to be elucidated. Alterations in the blood gene expression profiles of patients with SJIA at the time of randomisation were highly reproducible in the treatment and placebo groups. This was best visualised using a strategy based on the analysis of modules composed of transcriptionally co-regulated genes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Longitudinal changes correlating with disease resolution were found upon follow-up. Changes probably induced by treatment, regardless of clinical response, were also identified. Strikingly, an upregulation of type I IFN-regulated transcripts, which is not a feature of untreated SJIA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> was induced in the majority of anakinra-treated patients at M1 and M6. Accordingly, two IFN-inducible proteins were also significantly upregulated in the serum samples of patients at M6. The molecular and cellular basis for an IL-1 &#946;/type I IFN cross-regulation in SJIA remains unknown. Inhibition of type I IFN signalling by IL-1&#946; might occur through the induction of SOCS3, which is a negative regulator of IL-1-dependent acute inflammatory arthritis and osteoclast generation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Conversely, type I IFN decreases IL-1&#946; and induces IL-1Ra production by PBMCs in vitro.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> A similar cross-regulation has been described for type I IFN and TNF&#945;. Thus, patients with SJIA treated with TNF antagonists develop a blood IFN signature.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease treated with TNF antagonists develop anti-nuclear Abs and some of them display symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, a type I IFN-mediated disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Whether the upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes in anakinra-treated patients could have clinical consequences through the triggering of adaptive immunity remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with SJIA responded to IL-1 blockade as dramatically as patients with autoinflammatory syndromes, confirming a key role for IL-1 in a wide spectrum of diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Furthermore, clinical response and cytokine cascades induced upon IL1 blockade can be followed using blood gene expression profiling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Professor Kone-Paut, Drs Lemelle, Fouillet-Desjonqueres, Florkin and Neven were co-investigators.
