After local ethical committee approval of the study (Comitato Etico Cantonale Ref.&#160;N.

The final purpose is to ensure that spinal anaesthesia is performed in the safest way possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study will offer a new insight on the possible role of vena cava ultrasound and passive legs raising test as screening tools to prevent hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

The method is based on the following assumption: active leg elevation, in addition to its effect of venous pool shifting from the lower limbs to the chest, exerts a simultaneous stimulation effect on the iliac-femoral peri-arterial sympathetic system, causing an orthosympathetic reflex which can increase cardiac output (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;2</xref>). Alternatively, passive lower limb test has the advantage of mobilizing lower limb venous blood (estimated 300&#8211;500&#160;ml) without activating the orthosympathetic reflex.

Spinal anaesthesia technique is standardized for every patient: patients are positioned in lateral decubitus, L<sub>3</sub>-L<sub>4</sub> space is identified and spinal anaesthesia administered via a 27G pencil point beveled spinal needle (BBraun, Melsingen, Germany). A standard dose of bupivacaine 0.5% 10&#160;mg is slowly injected with needle oriented cranially and no barbotage. After injection, patients are immediately positioned supine for 30&#160;min before the beginning of surgery, than NIBP is measured every minute and recorded in a data collecting form. If the patient develops any sign or symptom of hypotension, he/she is treated according to standard internal protocol with a crystalloids bolus and eventually with neosynephrine, ephedrine or atropine according to the clinical setting.

In the common clinical practice, it is usual to administer fluids empirically. An empirical preventive fluid repletion however can represent per se a risk in patients with impaired cardiac and renal functions, since a volume overload in case of reduced ventricular compliance, can cause pulmonary oedema or congestive heart failure.</p><p id="p0355">Since about ten years both non-invasive and invasive techniques have been developed, with the specific purpose of optimizing fluid status on a more rational basis. This methods are based on the correlation between the levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO), according to the equation: MAP&#160;=&#160;CO * SVR. The latter explains why, in case of vasodilation, unless CO is increased, a lowering of SVR will inevitably cause a decrease of MAP. Determinants of blood pressure are: volemic status, vascular resistances (determined by the sympathetic tone) and cardiac output. In case of spinal anaesthesia the reduction in SVR causes relative hypovolemia. For this reason after spinal anaesthesia is often necessary an optimization of patients&#8217; volemic status through fluids administration.</p><p id="p0360">The use of different methods to assess fluid responsiveness in order to guide volume repletion avoiding blind fluid challenges has been extensively studied in critical care populations, however these techniques have never been studied in non-critical patients. The hypothesis that investigators want to test is that the use of TTE and PLRT before spinal anaesthesia, compared to an empirical fluid administration can reduce the rate of systemic hypotension through a titrated volemic repletion, avoiding both hypotension and fluid overload. The final purpose is to administer spinal anaesthesia in the safest possible way.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Trial status</title><p id="p0365">The ProCRHYSA trial is still ongoing at the time of submission, since patients recruitment has not been completed yet.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0370">The content of this article is the sole responsibility of the Authors and does not necessarily reflect the official views of the Sponsor (Service of Anesthesiology of Ospedale Regionale di Bellinzona e Valli, Tessin, Switzerland).
