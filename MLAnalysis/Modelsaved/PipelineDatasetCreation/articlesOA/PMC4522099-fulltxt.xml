It is also the major carbon source for many fungi and enzymes of these fungi are essential for the depolymerization of plant polysaccharides in industrial processes. This is a highly complex process that involves a large number of extracellular enzymes as well as non-hydrolytic proteins, whose production in fungi is controlled by a set of transcriptional regulators. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species form one of the best studied fungal genera in this field, and several species are used for the production of commercial enzyme cocktails.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It is often assumed that related fungi use similar enzymatic approaches to degrade plant polysaccharides. In this study we have compared the genomic content and the enzymes produced by eight Aspergilli for the degradation of plant biomass. All tested Aspergilli have a similar genomic potential to degrade plant biomass, with the exception of <italic>A. clavatus</italic> that has a strongly reduced pectinolytic ability. Despite this similar genomic potential their approaches to degrade plant biomass differ markedly in the overall activities as well as the specific enzymes they employ. While many of the genes have orthologs in (nearly) all tested species, only very few of the corresponding enzymes are produced by all species during growth on wheat bran or sugar beet pulp. In addition, significant differences were observed between the enzyme sets produced on these feedstocks, largely correlating with their polysaccharide composition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrate that <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species and possibly also other related fungi employ significantly different approaches to degrade plant biomass. This makes sense from an ecological perspective where mixed populations of fungi together degrade plant biomass. The results of this study indicate that combining the approaches from different species could result in improved enzyme mixtures for industrial applications, in particular saccharification of plant biomass for biofuel production. Such an approach may result in a much better improvement of saccharification efficiency than adding specific enzymes to the mixture of a single fungus, which is currently the most common approach used in biotechnology.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13068-015-0285-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Aspergillus</italic></kwd><kwd>Enzyme production</kwd><kwd>Polysaccharides</kwd><kwd>Biofuel</kwd><kwd>Saccharification</kwd><kwd>Diversity</kwd><kwd>Plant biomass degradation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Plant biomass is a highly attractive substrate for the production of biofuels and biochemicals as it is a renewable resource with a lower carbon footprint as compared to fossil substrates. It is also the predominant carbon source for most fungi and consists largely of polymeric compounds, of which polysaccharides are the main components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, lignin encrusts the polysaccharides and acts as a physical barrier that impedes fungal enzymes from gaining access to them. Fungi cannot take up intact polysaccharides, but need to degrade them extracellularly to monomeric and oligomeric compounds using diverse enzymatic mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Plant polysaccharide degradation by fungi has been a topic of study for many decades due to its relevance in many industrial applications, such as paper and pulp, food and feed, beverages, textiles and detergents. The increasing interest in the production of alternative fuels and chemicals from plant biomass has provided an even greater push for research into fungal decomposition of plant biomass. In contrast to the earlier applications, production of biofuels and biochemicals would ideally involve complete depolymerization of the polysaccharides to monomers, putting a much higher demand on the efficiency of the enzymatic mixtures employed by industry.</p><p>Analysis of an increasing number of fungal genome sequences has demonstrated the fundamental differences in the plant polysaccharide degrading machinery of fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, the regulatory systems that control plant biomass degradation also differ strongly among fungi, although they are largely conserved among different <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Results from a previous study on the utilization of polysaccharides by three Aspergilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] suggest that related fungal species may have developed different approaches to plant biomass degradation. In nature, biomass-degrading fungi live in mixed communities with other microorganisms. It can be expected that different species target distinct components of the substrate and degrade them using dissimilar enzyme combinations. An enhanced understanding of these strategies will not only increase our knowledge of fungal biodiversity, but will help in the design of efficient industrial enzyme mixtures for plant biomass degradation. In this study, we compared the plant biomass degradation potential and approaches of eight <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species: <italic>A. clavatus</italic>, <italic>A. fischeri</italic>, <italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and <italic>A. terreus</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table&#160;S1). The main aim was to evaluate if these related fungi have significant differences in their approach to degrade plant biomass and if this could provide leads to improve the saccharification efficiency of commercial enzyme cocktails. To do this we compared the genomic potential of these fungi as well as the enzymes sets they produce during growth on two common feedstocks, wheat bran and sugar beet pulp, that differ significantly in their composition (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>Composition of the plant biomass substrates used in this study</p></caption><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are given in mol%.

The percentage of GH genes related to plant polysaccharide degradation (PPD) is 58&#8211;66% for all genomes, except that <italic>A. clavatus</italic> has 20&#8211;30% less GH genes than the others (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), largely due to a reduction in pectinases (GH28, GH54, GH78, GH88) (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). <italic>A. clavatus</italic> also contains the lowest percentage of PPD-related PL genes (71% as compared to &gt;86%), which are also all related to pectin degradation. The variations in CAZy content are relatively small compared to previous studies with a more diverse set of fungal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Variations in gene numbers are particularly obvious in certain CAZy families involved in the degradation of mannan (GH26), pectin (GH28, GH53, GH78, GH88, GH93, PL1, PL3, CE8 and CE12), xyloglucan (GH29 and GH74), starch (GH31), sucrose/inulin (GH32), cellulose (GH45 and AA9), and xylan (GH115 and CE15). Genes encoding lignin-modifying peroxidases are not present in any of these genomes, but significant differences are found in the number of laccases and other oxidoreductase enzymes, which may play a role in lignin or polysaccharide degradation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S2B). <italic>A. niger</italic> is richest in laccases (13 in its genome), while the other species have two to nine.</p><p>Orthologous clustering of the CAZymes showed that only 14.7% of the genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes are shared by all species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S3A). In contrast, 27.5% of the genes are unique to a single species, with the largest number in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>A. terreus</italic>. For the oxidative enzymes, 10.8% of the genes are shared by all species, while 40.8% of the genes are unique to a single species, with again the largest number in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>A. terreus</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S3B). In general, the CAZyme distribution among the species follows their phylogenetic relationship. In total, this means that only 70 genes are shared by all species, while the number of unique genes differs strongly by species (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Growth on plant biomass related substrates</title><p>Growth of the eight <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species was evaluated on 35 plant biomass related carbon sources (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, full profiles are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fung-growth.org">www.fung-growth.org</ext-link>). Two isolates per species were tested to check that the differences are species specific and not strain specific. The general growth speed differed between the strains of a species, but for most species no significant carbon source related differences were observed between the strains. An exception to this is <italic>A. niger</italic> CBS513.88 that grew poorly on all pure carbon sources and was shown to have an amino acid auxotrophy (unpublished data), which explains this phenotype. Apparently, both wheat bran (WB) and sugar beet pulp (SBP) contain sufficient protein/amino acids to supplement this deficiency. All other strains grew well on MM&#160;+&#160;glucose and glucose was therefore used as an internal reference to compare the strains, to avoid misleading differences caused by general differences in growth speed between the species. Growth on the other substrates relative to growth on glucose was then compared between the species.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#160;2</label><caption><p>Growth profiling of eight Aspergilli on plant-biomass related carbon sources. A selection of the growth profile of the eight <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species on 35 plant biomass related carbon sources is presented. Minimal medium (MM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] was used supplemented with 25&#160;mM of mono- or disaccharide, 1% polysaccharide or 3% crude plant biomass. Strains were grown for 5&#160;days after which pictures were taken immediately.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_285_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Growth on pure cellulose was zero to very poor for all species. Most fungi had similar growth on glucose, maltose, starch and xylan, with the exception of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, for which poor growth on maltose was observed for one strain. Growth on sucrose was similar to growth on glucose for nearly all strains, but strong differences were observed on inulin. Good growth on this substrate was observed for <italic>A. niger</italic> ATCC1015 and <italic>A. fischeri</italic>, while for all other species growth was reduced compared to sucrose. This does not correlate with the number of putative inulin-targeting genes in the genomes as <italic>A. fischeri</italic> has only two (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), while <italic>A. niger</italic> has six just like <italic>A. terreus</italic>, which grows poorly on inulin. Good growth compared to the other species was observed for <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic> on guar gum (galactomannan). While <italic>A. nidulans</italic> has the highest number of galactomannan-targeting genes (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), <italic>A. niger</italic> has in fact the lowest number and <italic>A. terreus</italic> again grows poorly, even though it has the second highest number of galactomannan-targeting genes. Growth of <italic>A. clavatus</italic> was particularly poor on pectin which correlates well with its very low number of pectin-targeting genes (only 30 putative genes), which was less than half of the other species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S2A, B).</p><p>All species grew well on wheat bran and also, with only <italic>A. clavatus</italic> having reduced growth, on sugar beet pulp. These substrates were therefore selected to analyze their enzymatic ability in more detail. Composition analysis (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) showed that wheat bran contains mainly cellulose and (arabino)xylan, with xyloglucan and pectin as minor components. In contrast, sugar beet pulp contains mainly cellulose, xyloglucan and pectin, which explains the reduced growth of <italic>A. clavatus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Enzyme profiles during growth on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp</title><p>A preliminary test in which eight plant biomass degrading enzymes were measured at day two, three and four of cultivation, demonstrated that at day three activities were maximal for all fungi (data not shown). This time point was therefore selected for the full enzymatic analysis. Nineteen extracellular, lignocellulose-active enzyme activities of the liquid cultures were measured (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures&#160;S1&#8211;S3). Comparison of these profiles demonstrated strong differences among the species, not only in the quantities of the activities, but also in the induction of specific enzymes. For instance, the highest activity levels for most enzymes of <italic>A. terreus</italic> were observed during growth on sugar beet pulp, while wheat bran resulted in higher levels of most enzymes for <italic>A. flavus</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#160;S1). When the individual activities were compared across the species, specific differences became noticeable. Wheat bran consists mainly of cellulose and arabinoxylan and the main regulator controlling degradation of these polysaccharides is XlnR, which is present in all Aspergilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Endoxylanase and &#946;-xylosidase were mainly produced on wheat bran, and levels were particularly high for <italic>A. niger</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#160;S1). Endoarabinanase, &#945;-rhamnosidase, pectate lyase and endogalactanases, all related to pectin degradation, were mainly produced on sugar beet pulp, but rarely were all four activities produced by one species. Sugar beet pulp contains mainly cellulose and pectin and therefore pectinases and cellulases would be expected to be the main enzymes produced on this substrate, which is confirmed by our data.</p><p>Mass spectrometric analysis of the extracellular proteins confirmed the activity measurements with respect to the enzymes that were detected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S4A&#8211;D). Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the presence of orthologous enzymes involved in the degradation of different polysaccharides in wheat bran and sugar beet pulp. This analysis demonstrates the high degree of diversity among the species in the production of orthologous enzymes. Only a few orthologous enzymes are produced by all or most species and in most cases they are produced on both wheat bran and sugar beet pulp (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) although often with significantly different levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S4A&#8211;D).

Correlating the number of genes per CAZy family demonstrated that with respect to genome content, closely related species (<italic>A. oryzae</italic> &#8211; <italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. fischeri</italic> &#8211; <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>) cluster together (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). This indicates that the evolution of their genome content related to plant biomass degradation follows the evolutionary history of the species. However, more distantly related species, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. terreus</italic>, can display similar CAZy content. A possible explanation for this finding is that natural habitat exerts a stronger influence on genome evolution than phylogenetic relatedness.</p><p>No clear correlation was observed between the enzyme activities produced in response to complex substrates and evolutionary relatedness (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), possibly due to the range of non-plant substrates some species are known to consume (e.g. collagen for <italic>A. terreus</italic>, <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and insect larvae for <italic>A. clavatus</italic>), resulting in a varying biotope range and dependence on plant biomass. The composition of wheat bran and sugar beet pulp is different and they should elicit different activity profiles. For six of the tested species, the wheat bran and sugar beet pulp activity profiles diverge strongly. Unexpectedly, the sugar beet pulp and wheat bran activity profiles clustered together for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. oryzae</italic>. Two of the three tested <italic>A. niger</italic> strains (N402 and ATCC 1015) clustered together for both substrates, while the third (CBS 513.88) was strongly divergent in the enzyme activity profile. These results show that strains of the same species (CBS 513.88 and ATCC 1015) with near identical genomic content can use significantly different sets of enzymes to hydrolyze complex biomass. It should be noted that genome sequence analysis suggests that strains ATCC 1015 and N402 are likely descended from the same isolate (A. Tsang and co-workers, unpublished data), which explains the clustering of their activity profiles.</p><p>Correlation of the proteomics data did not follow the activity correlation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c), which can be explained by the production of non-orthologous enzymes for the same general activity by different species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S4A&#8211;D). This adds an additional dimension to the highly divergent strategies of these Aspergilli. Considering the fairly similar genome content of these species, we conclude that the differences in their plant biomass degrading strategies are mainly at the regulatory level. More detailed studies into the regulation of orthologous CAZyme encoding genes in several species could reveal whether this is due to different sets of target genes of the main regulators or whether additional unknown regulators modulate the influence of the main regulators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we compared eight Aspergilli with respect to plant polysaccharide degradation. The variations in CAZyme content between these species were relatively low as compared to previous studies in which a more diverse set of fungal species was compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This can be explained by the close phylogenetic relationships and/or by and the highly similar habitats of these Aspergilli, which would direct genome evolution in a similar direction. Human use of and/or interaction with the species differs markedly; with <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>A. oryzae</italic> being widely used industrial fungi, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> one of the most significant opportunistic fungal human pathogens, and <italic>A. flavus</italic> a plant pathogen. However, all these species are common inhabitants of soil and stored agricultural products, and their spores are widespread in both indoor and outdoor environments. Although some of the sequenced strains are domesticated and not recent natural isolates, the comparison to a second strain that is a natural isolate showed that growth on 35 carbon sources is nearly identical for two strains of the same species. This demonstrates that the sequenced isolates have maintained their natural ability to use the tested carbon sources.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#160;4</label><caption><p>Correlation analysis of the genome (<bold>a</bold>), enzyme activity (<bold>b</bold>) and proteomics data (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_285_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Hierarchical clustering of the plant polysaccharide degrading enzymes of these species demonstrated that in general the species with the most similar CAZome are also taxonomically close.</p><p>The number of unique genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S2A, B) per species also correlates well with the phylogenetic distance of the species. The lowest number was found for <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, <italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. fischeri</italic> and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. As the first two and the last two species, respectively, are closely related, their high similarity explains this low number. The more distant species (<italic>A. nidulans</italic>, <italic>A. terreus</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. clavatus</italic>) have higher numbers of unique genes.</p><p>A high level of variation was detected in the enzyme activities of the tested species during growth on sugar beet pulp and wheat bran. While all species grew well on these substrates, with the exception of somewhat less growth of <italic>A. clavatus</italic> on sugar beet pulp, the enzyme profiles of the species showed strong differences. Wheat bran consists mainly of cellulose and arabinoxylan, while sugar beet pulp contains mainly cellulose and pectin. Enzymes able to degrade these different combinations of polysaccharides would therefore be expected to be prominent in the culture filtrate of all species grown on these substrates. Our study confirmed this as nearly all enzyme activities detected on wheat bran in all species are involved in xylan and cellulose degradation, while mainly pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes were detected on sugar beet pulp. The main regulator controlling the production of xylanolytic and cellulolytic enzymes in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> is XlnR, which has been studied in detail in <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. XlnR activates the expression of xylanolytic and cellulolytic genes in response to the presence of xylan or xylose, the latter being the actual inducer. Indications for similar regulation have been reported for the other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], although the range of target genes can differ per species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Regulation studies in <italic>A. niger</italic> have previously demonstrated that pectinolytic genes are induced by galacturonic acid, rhamnose, polygalacturonic acid or pectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Differences in pectinolytic gene content between <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. oryzae</italic> may be influenced by the pH of their natural habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. An acidic pH favors pectin hydrolases, while a neutral to alkaline pH favors pectin lyases, supported by the finding that all fungal GH28 pectin hydrolases have activity optimum between pH 2 and pH 5, while pectin lyases have optimum between pH 7 and pH 10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mycoclap.fungalgenomics.ca">https://mycoclap.fungalgenomics.ca</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The pH of most samples was 7 except for <italic>A. nidulans</italic> on sugar beet pulp (pH 8), <italic>A. niger</italic> on wheat bran (pH 5.5) and sugar beet pulp (pH 4.5), and <italic>A. clavatus</italic> on sugar beet pulp (pH 6). The pH in the sugar beet pulp cultures correlates well with the pectin hydrolase and lyase activities and with the proteomics results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table&#160;S4A&#8211;D). Therefore, the differences in enzyme levels are likely caused by regulatory variation. Since the major regulators are shared by all tested species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], their function or range of target genes in the tested Aspergilli is different and/or additional non-shared regulators are involved in the utilization of complex biomass. A difference in the function of the arabinanolytic regulator AraR in <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> was recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and the inducers for activation of AmyR also appear to differ between <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. More detailed analysis of the set of target genes, and function and mechanism of the polysaccharide related regulators in the other species will be required to understand the mechanism responsible for these differences. Interestingly, the production of several cellulases appears to be conserved among the species, suggesting that this may be a core-activity for all species. In contrast, the production of hemicellulases is highly varied, suggesting specific adaptations of the species in their biomass degrading approach.</p><p>Laccase activity was detected for most species, with the highest activity on wheat bran for <italic>A. flavus</italic> and on sugar beet pulp for <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. This does not correlate with the numbers of putative laccases detected in the genomes, suggesting significantly different regulation of the production of these enzymes among the species. Induction of laccase-encoding genes has been mainly studied in basidiomycetes in which transcription is modulated by metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>), aromatic compounds, nitrogen and carbon sources (nature and ratio) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In ascomycetes, regulatory elements such as heat shock elements, metal response elements and nitrogen metabolite regulation elements (NIT-2 like) were identified in the promoter region of laccase-like multicopper oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In addition, laccases are also involved in other biological processes, such as spore pigment formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and not only in lignin degradation, so the total number of laccases likely does not reflect the number of laccases which play a role in plant biomass degradation.</p><p>Although the fungi tested in this study produce diverse enzyme sets, they all grow well on the crude plant biomass substrates. This suggests that different strategies for the degradation of plant biomass may be equally efficient (as measured by fungal growth). In biotechnological applications, such as biofuel production, complete hydrolysis of the plant biomass is difficult to achieve with currently available enzyme cocktails. This may in part be explained by the absence of specific activities in these mixtures. The data obtained in this study show the existence of distinctly different enzymatic approaches to degrade biomass. A judicious mix of these approaches is likely to result in improved enzyme cocktails for biomass hydrolysis. Recently it was shown that addition of <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> hydrolases increases the efficiency of a <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> enzyme mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In this study we provide indications that similar results could be obtained with more closely related fungi. The advantage of using enzymes from other Aspergilli to improve enzyme cocktails of <italic>A. niger</italic> or <italic>A. oryzae</italic> is that heterologous production of these enzymes is not likely to cause problems due to the high similarity in gene structure of these species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study we demonstrated that closely related fungi use highly diverse enzymatic strategies for the degradation of the same substrates, but with similar efficiency. It can be assumed that in nature not all fungi target the same parts of the substrate. Therefore the identification of the enzyme sets employed by different fungi can be used to design efficient commercial enzyme cocktails by combining these enzyme sets. This could significantly improve the saccharification efficiency of industrial enzyme cocktails. Combining the complete enzymes set of two fungi is likely to improve saccharification efficiency more than adding specific enzymes to the cocktail produced by a single species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Media, growth conditions and chemicals</title><p>The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table&#160;S1. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> minimal medium was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

To confirm that the detected differences were species specific, a second isolate of each species was examined along with the sequenced strain. Growth on 25&#160;mM glucose was used as a reference because the tested strains grow at different rates and glucose, among the monosaccharides, supported the fastest growth for all species.
