One solution to this problem is to explore the dynamics of PDZs, which may provide insights about how intramolecular communication occurs within a single domain. Here, we develop an advancement of perturbation response scanning (PRS) that couples elastic network models with linear response theory (LRT) to predict key residues in allosteric transitions of the two most studied PDZs (PSD-95 PDZ3 domain and hPTP1E PDZ2 domain). With PRS, we first identify the residues that give the highest mean square fluctuation response upon perturbing the binding sites. Strikingly, we observe that the residues with the highest mean square fluctuation response agree with experimentally determined residues involved in allosteric transitions. Second, we construct the allosteric pathways by linking the residues giving the same directional response upon perturbation of the binding sites. The predicted intramolecular communication pathways reveal that PSD-95 and hPTP1E have different pathways through the dynamic coupling of different residue pairs. Moreover, our analysis provides a molecular understanding of experimentally observed hidden allostery of PSD-95. We show that removing the distal third alpha helix from the binding site alters the allosteric pathway and decreases the binding affinity. Overall, these results indicate that (i) dynamics plays a key role in allosteric regulations of PDZs, (ii) the local changes in the residue interactions can lead to significant changes in the dynamics of allosteric regulations, and (iii) this might be the mechanism that each PDZ uses to tailor their binding specificities regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>PDZ domain proteins (PDZs) act as adapters in organizing functional protein complexes. Through dynamic interactions, PDZs play a key role in mediating key cellular functions in the cell, and they are linked to currently challenging diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancer. Moreover, they are associated with allosteric regulations in mediating signaling. Therefore, it is critical to have knowledge of how the allosteric transition occurs in PDZs. We investigate the allosteric response of the two most studied PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E, using the perturbation response scanning (PRS) approach. The method treats the protein as an elastic network and uses linear response theory (LRT) to obtain residue fluctuations upon exerting directed random forces on selected residues. With this efficient and fast approach, we identify the key residues that mediate long-range communication and find the allosteric pathways. Although the structures of PSD-95 and hPTP1E are very similar, our analysis predicts that their allosteric pathways are different. We also observe a significant change in allosteric pathways and a decrease in binding affinity upon removal of the distal &#945;3 helix of PSD-95. This approach enables us to understand how dynamic interactions play an important role in allosteric regulations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allosteric regulation orchestrates functional behaviors in biological networks through appropriate switches. From a biochemical perspective, allostery can be described as a perturbation at one place in a protein structure, such as the binding of a ligand that alters the binding affinity of a distant site or enzymatic activity <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Goodey1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Several models have been suggested for explaining the &#8216;allosteric mechanism&#8217;. Models of conformational transition between co-existing states such as the MWC model of Monod <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Monod1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and the &#8216;induced fit&#8217; KNF model of Koshland <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Koshland1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> were the first views among them. They described allostery as a binding event that causes conformational change via a single propagation pathway <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-delSol1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A new view of allosteric transitions supported from NMR studies, referred to as the &#8216;population shift&#8217; model, has replaced the MWC and KNF models <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gunasekaran1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Swain1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The population shift models claim that a protein in the unliganded form exhibits an ensemble of conformational states and ligand binding leads to a redistribution of the population of these states. In this view, it is important to explore how protein dynamics might contribute to allostery and make communication possible within a protein. Unlike the classical allostery models, the population shift-models also suggest that allostery can be mediated without any significant conformational change <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> but rather from changes in dynamics.</p><p>Moreover, recent experimental and theoretical evidences indicate that allostery is not limited to multi-domain proteins or complexes <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gunasekaran1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and it may even be a fundamental property of all proteins, even single domain proteins. In single domain proteins, it is evident that residues that are energetically connected through structural rearrangements and dynamics lead to allosteric regulation <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Hilser1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. More importantly, studies on single domain protein PDZ (post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) have indicated that allostery can arise not only from large conformational changes, but also from changes in dynamics <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Petit1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Indeed, PDZ domain proteins (PDZs) are the most studied system for understanding <italic>single domain allostery</italic>

In many different cellular contexts, PDZs function to transduce these binding events into favorable domain-domain assembly of complexes <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, it is critical to understand the residues involved in these allosteric pathways in order to modulate the PDZ mediated interaction in cell regulation especially those in disease pathways. Moreover, a recent experimental study by Petit et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Petit1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, has confirmed yet another strong allosteric power of one of the PDZs: the hidden dynamic allostery. The removal of the non-canonical third helix (&#945;3) in PSD-95 (PDZ3), which lies outside of the binding pocket, reduces the binding affinity drastically due to a change in side chain dynamics upon truncation, indicating the role of entropy and dynamics in allosteric regulation. More interestingly, further investigation has shown that the removal of this distal &#945;3 disrupts the communication between PDZ3 and SH3-GK, which modulates the binding of Disc large protein (Dlg) to the localization protein GukHolder <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Qian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, the hidden dynamic allostery related with &#945;3 is indeed a regulatory module within the context of larger interdomain interactions.</p><p>In summary, PDZs do not solely act as simple scaffold proteins. On the contrary through dynamics, they propagate signals to functionally important distant sites for intramolecular and intermolecular interactions <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Lockless1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. They all have the same conserved structure and similar sequences <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Lockless1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, yet different PDZs have evolved different dynamics properties tailored to mediate different functions in the cell <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, it would be very important to understand how signals are passed from one residue to another within the network of PDZs and how the sequential and structural variations alter the allosteric pathways for those allosteric PDZs <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Fuentes1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-vandenBerk1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Here we would like to tackle this problem with our new method called perturbation response scanning (PRS) <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Atilgan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Atilgan2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. PRS treats the protein as an elastic network and uses linear response theory (LRT) to obtain residue fluctuations upon external perturbation. By sequentially exerting directed random forces on single residues along the chain of the unbound form and recording the resulting relative changes in the residue coordinates using LRT, we can successfully reproduce the residue displacements from the experimental structures of bound and unbound forms. The method is well established and tested for 25 proteins that display a variety of conformational motions upon ligand binding, including shear, hinge, allosteric, and partial refolding as well as more complex protein motions <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Atilgan2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we investigate the allosteric transitions by analyzing response fluctuation profiles upon perturbation on binding site residues by PRS. We focus on two widely studied PDZs: the third PDZ from the post-synaptic-density-95 (PSD-95 PDZ3) and the second PDZ from the human tyrosine phosphates 1E (hPTP1E PDZ2). The results from our computationally inexpensive and effective approach successfully identify the dynamically linked allosteric residues obtained from experiments (NMR or mutagenesis techniques) <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Petit1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Fuentes1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Fuentes2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> as well as evolutionarily coupled residues from sequence-based statistical approaches <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Lockless1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Suel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and key residues predicted from molecular dynamics, normal mode analysis and protein energy-based networks <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Dhulesia1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gerek1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Vijayabaskar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. As a further test, we construct the communication pathway between these residues that might be responsible in transmitting allosteric signals. We achieve this through linking residues that show similar directionality of motion upon perturbation of binding sites. Interestingly, the constructed allosteric pathway indicates a strong structural residue coupling network. Moreover, we observe that the two PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E, have distinct allosteric pathways despite their structural similarity, indicating the role of dynamic coupling in these domains <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gerek1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ho2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The residues in the allosteric pathway of PSD-95 are homogenously distributed along the secondary structural motifs while the allosteric pathway of hPTP1E shows more localization around in regions of &#946;1&#8211;&#946;2 loop, &#946;2 and &#946;3 strands and the region of &#946;5 strand and the &#945;2 helix, missing the region of the &#945;1 helix. The differences in the allosteric pathways of these two PDZs indicate the critical of role of dynamic coupling in PDZ domains and that differences in residue sequences within the same fold can lead to different dynamic coupling. Indeed, PDZs master this to mediate different cellular functions in different parts of the cell <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition to that, our PRS analysis indicates that the allosteric pathway of PSD-95 significantly alters upon removal of the distal third helix (&#945;3 helix). This indicates that local changes in the network alter the directionalities of correlated motion, which may lead to a change in binding affinity <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gerek1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Gerek2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Strikingly, when we incorporate the change in backbone dynamics into the docking computation through generating multiple conformations by PRS, we also observe an increase in binding energies upon removal of the third helix.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>Our objective is to apply a computational approach, perturbation response scanning (PRS), to identify the network of dynamically important residues and propose a possible pathway responsible for intramolecular signaling. As we mentioned earlier, PRS combines the elastic network model with linear response theory to compute the residue fluctuation profile of an unbound conformation upon exerting a random external force on a residue, and it is shown to be very successful in capturing binding-induced conformational changes <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Atilgan2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. When a ligand approaches a receptor, it exerts forces around binding pockets, inducing certain dynamical changes. Here, we utilize PRS to mimic the nature of a binding event by exerting forces on the binding sites of an unbound conformation. Thus, we analyze the residue response fluctuation profile upon exerting random forces on binding sites of unbound conformations and identify the residues showing distinctive responses (i.e. higher fluctuation than the average fluctuation response) upon perturbing the residues at the binding sites. (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details.)</p><p>Elastic network models (ENMs) are utilized to explore allosteric behaviors in proteins <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Bahar1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. ENMs are based on a purely mechanical approach, viewing a protein structure as an interconnected series of springs between interacting residue pairs. They provide information on equilibrium fluctuations and the various contributions to those fluctuations from different modes of motion. Moreover, by introducing a specific perturbation to the system and measuring its <italic>dynamic</italic> response, ENMs can provide detailed information about the energy landscapes, beyond the correlations between equilibrium fluctuations. To this aim, there are new modified ENMs developed whereby perturbations are introduced through modifying effective force constants <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, distances between contacting pairs <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, or both <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ming1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ming2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Most of these analyses are focused on changes in the most functionally related mode (i.e. usually the slowest modes) upon perturbations. Although an ENM approach itself, our PRS model differs in two aspects. First, we introduce perturbations by inserting random external forces on the nodes of unbound conformations, (i.e. &#945;-carbons) instead of modifying the distances between pairs of nodes or spring constants. This enables us to exert external forces on the binding sites (i.e., random Brownian kicks) and analyze the residues affected by the perturbation on the binding sites similar to the natural allosteric regulations where an approaching ligand induces certain dynamical changes in distal parts of the protein. Second, PRS uses the entire Hessian matrix to compute the residue displacement response upon exerting random forces on the selected residues. The allosteric regulation in small domain proteins like PDZs can arise through changes in dynamics <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Smock1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, unlike large conformational changes observed in large systems such as GroEL <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Tehver1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and myosin <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zheng5" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Therefore, more than one normal mode can contribute to allosteric regulations. In that respect, the advantage of using the full Hessian matrix in PRS can induce several related modes upon perturbation at the binding site.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of critical residues in allosteric regulation of PDZ interactions</title><p>Mutagenesis and NMR relaxation methods demonstrated that a network of residues exists that has a dynamic response upon ligand binding in both hPTP1E PDZ2 and PSD-95 PDZ3 <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Petit1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Chi2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Fuentes1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Fuentes2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

If the residues collectively move in line, their directionality should be parallel. After obtaining the directionality of different pairs of residues, we carry out a systematic analysis of the residues with the highest allosteric response ratio. For these residues, we search all possible interactions with a window size of 3 and identify residue pairs that collectively move in line together.

The discrepancy between our model and the two proposed pathways by SCA may result because SCA analysis investigates the signaling pathway originating from a single residue, His372. However other residues at the binding pocket may be important for intramolecular signaling. Our analysis uses response profiles obtained by sequentially exerting a random force at a single residue along all the residues at the binding site. Thus, our approach might lead to the prediction of extra residues, such as Lys380, that interacts with the peptide and is near His372. Our model does not include Phe325 in the allosteric pathway, yet it finds Ile327, which is near residue 325. Moreover, MD analysis has shown that the mutation of Ile327 to Val leads to a dramatic signal reduction of Phe325, showing that position 327 is involved in mediating the signal pathway and highly linked with Phe325 <xref rid="pcbi.1002154-Ota1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, when we compare the allosteric pathways of the two different PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E, we see a clear difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002154-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

Here we investigate how the perturbation of a residue at the binding site is transferred through the dynamics of the residue network interactions. Thus we investigate the allosteric response of the two most investigated PDZs, PSD-95 and hPTP1E using our low resolution dynamics approach PRS. PRS is based on ENM where it uses only the topology of the given structure, and then using linear response theory, it computes the response fluctuation vector of each residue in the chain upon exerting a random force on a single residue. Using PRS, we compute the allosteric response ratio for each residue, which is the normalized average mean square fluctuation response upon perturbation. Most of the residues that are identified experimentally as residues in allosteric pathways indeed show high allosteric response ratios, indicating the consistency and usefulness of the PRS method for extracting the residues in the signaling pathway. Since PRS not only gives the mean square fluctuation of the response but also its directionality, we construct the allosteric pathway by linking the residues aligning in the same direction upon perturbations. Interestingly, our analysis has shown that the allosteric pathways of PSD-95 and hPTP1E are distinctively different from each other, despite the fact that they have similar structures. Likewise, we also observe a significant change in the allosteric pathway upon truncation of the distal &#945;3 helix of PSD-95. Moreover, our flexible docking analysis where we generate an ensemble of multiple receptor conformations by PRS shows an increase in binding energy upon truncation.

</p><p>In order to predict which residues are critical in allosteric pathways, we distinguish the residues exhibiting significant fluctuation upon perturbation on binding site residues. Therefore, we define an index called the allosteric response ratio, &#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> for each residue, which is the ratio of average fluctuation response of the residue <italic>j</italic> upon perturbations placed on binding site residues to average response of residue <italic>j</italic> upon perturbations on all residues, shown as:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.e013.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where A<sub>ij</sub> is the response fluctuation profile of residue <italic>j</italic> upon perturbation of residue <italic>i</italic>. The numerator is the average mean square fluctuation response obtained over the perturbation of the binding pocket (BP) residues, whereas denominator is the average mean square fluctuation response over all residue perturbation. Thus, N<italic><sub>BP</sub></italic> is the number of residues in the binding pocket and N<italic><sub>BP1</sub></italic> and N<sub><italic>BPm</italic></sub> correspond to residue indexes in the binding pocket (residues 320-328 and 371-380 for PSD-95 and residues 16-23 and 70-79 for hPTP1E). To identify the critical residues in the allosteric pathway, for each residues we compute &#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> in each perturbed direction and take into account of the maximum value of &#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>. Then, we sort out all &#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> and select the residue positions by setting a threshold of 1.0 or better. To understand how the sensitivity and specificity change, we predict the allosteric residues by varying the threshold of response ratio lower or higher than 1.00.

The details of the analysis are explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002154.s007">Text S1</xref>. The comparison of residues that give the highest mean square fluctuation response (&#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>&gt;1.00 for PSD-95) upon perturbation with respect to the coarse-grained approach and the essential dynamics analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002154.s006">Table S6</xref>. Overall, 82% of predicted residues from the essential dynamics analysis of all-atom MD trajectories are the same as those obtained by our low-resolution model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002154.s007">Text S1</xref> for more details). Moreover, the residues found by the coarse-grained approach that do not overlap with those of the all-atom approach are sequentially in close proximity to the residues identified by both approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Determination of pathways</title><p>PRS can be used to measure the degree of collectivity of the response of a group of neighboring residues to a perturbation on any residue. This enables us to construct an allosteric pathway through linking those residues showing similar response upon perturbations of the binding site.</p><p>To understand the nature of the response, the submatrix of residue <italic>k</italic> in response to perturbations in <italic>i</italic> from the inverse of the Hessian (See Equation 7) matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.e014.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>
</p><p>If the residues collectively move in line they have a single dominant eigenvalue and their corresponding eigenvectors should be parallel, indicating that they move cooperatively in the same direction. Therefore, to compare if the responses of two residues are same, we check the dot product of their corresponding eigenvectors,<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.e015.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where &#952; is the angle between the two eigenvectors. After obtaining the directionality of different pairs of residues upon perturbations on the binding site, we carry out a systematic network analysis using only the residues that give the highest fluctuation response upon perturbation. For these identified residues, we use a window size of 3 (i.e. if the residue 320 shows the highest mean square fluctuation response, the residues 319, 320, and 321 are taken into account), and search extensively to find residue pairs in sequence that move collectively upon perturbation. To this aim, we first calculate the overlap coefficients of the residue pairs by using the dot product of response vectors (Eq. 12). Using a cut off value of 0.98, we find the residue pairs that move in the same direction. Importantly, this means we identify the residue pairs showing also a high allosteric response ratio. We then perform an extensive search by generating all possible pathways through connecting these identified residue pairs and weight each pathway with the product of overlap coefficients. As an example, the predicted allosteric residue containing 314 in PSD-95 has the highest overlap coefficient with residue 327 with a value of 0.99. Then residue 327 has also very high overlap coefficient (with a value of 0.98) with residue 338. We then construct a pathway Ile314&#8594;Ile327&#8594;Ile338 which gives a total weight of 0.99x0.98&#8202;=&#8202;0.97. After exhaustive construction of all possible pathways we select the <italic>pathway</italic> with maximum total <italic>weight</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>The list of residues identified as the allosteric residues of SAP97 with the PRS and mutational analysis method.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>The list of residues identified as the allosteric residues of hPTP1E with different methods including statistical coupling analysis (SCA), molecular dynamics, rotamerically induced perturbations (RIP) and our PRS method.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>The list of residues identified as the allosteric residues of PSD-95 with different methods including statistical coupling analysis (SCA), the anisotropic thermal diffusion (ATD) method, the structural perturbation method (SPM), the rotamerically induced perturbations (RIP) method and our PRS method.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Contingency tables showing a correlation between each method and experiments and each method and PRS for PSD-95 and hPTP1E.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s005"><label>Table S5</label><caption><p>Residues that give the highest mean square fluctuation response when the threshold of response ratio is chosen lower/higher than 1.00.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s006"><label>Table S6</label><caption><p>Residues that give the highest mean square fluctuation response (&#967;<italic><sub>j</sub></italic>&gt;1.00 for PSD-95) upon perturbation by using coarse-grained approach and analysis based on all-atom REMD trajectories.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1002154.s007"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Essential dynamics analysis.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1002154.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge Jaimy Tomlinson, Adam de Graffe, Tyler Glembo and Ashini Bolia for their valuable comments and Esin Pektas for her help in the preparation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002154-g004">Figure 4</xref>.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through TeraGrid resources provided by Ranger and the Fulton High Performance Computing Initiative at Arizona State University for computer time.
