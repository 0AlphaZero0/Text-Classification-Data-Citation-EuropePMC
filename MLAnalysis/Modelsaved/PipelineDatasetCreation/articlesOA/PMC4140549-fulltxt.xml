Their biochemical signature is the presence of defective activity in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes, resulting in faulty oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which can impair ATP production. Mutations in several genes associated with defects of mitochondrial protein synthesis, affecting either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nucleus-encoded genes, have been reported in a range of mitochondrial syndromes [Rotig, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>].</p><p>Translation of the 13 mtDNA-encoded, OXPHOS-related proteins takes place within the mitochondrial matrix. This complex process requires ribosomal and transfer RNAs (rRNAs and tRNAs), encoded by mtDNA, and more than 100 proteins, encoded by nuclear genes, translated by cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria. These include aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), ribosomal proteins, ribosomal assembly factors, tRNA- and rRNA-modifying enzymes, initiation, elongation, and termination factors [Smits et al., <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>]. Mutations in any component of the mitochondrial translation machinery can in principle cause inherited mitochondrial disorders affecting the MRC complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits (cI, cIII, cIV, cV), with the preservation of complex II, the only complex which has no mtDNA-encoded proteins.</p><p>An increasing number of mitochondrial translation disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding mt-aaRSs [Konovalova and Tyynismaa, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>], which catalyze the ligation of specific amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, a crucial process for faithful protein synthesis. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic aaRSs are encoded by distinct nuclear genes, with the exception of GARS and KARS, which are present in both cellular compartments. The term <italic>aaRS2</italic> indicates the gene coding for the mitochondrial enzyme. Mutations in <italic>aaRS2</italic> genes have been associated with diverse clinical presentations, usually characterized by early-onset and autosomal recessive transmission. A relatively tight genotype&#8211;phenotype correlation has been reported for most of these syndromes, although the basis of cell- or tissue-specific damage remains unclear, since all mt-aaRSs are ubiquitous enzymes operating in the same pathway [Rotig, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>].</p><p>We report here the identification by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the first described mutations in <italic>VARS2</italic> (MIM# 612802) and <italic>TARS2</italic> (MIM# 612805) in patients with clinical presentations compatible with mitochondrial disorders and OXPHOS deficiency. All identified variants were not present in SNPs databases, predicted to be deleterious, segregated within the families, and associated with decreased aminoacylation of the corresponding tRNAs in mutant immortalized fibroblasts; moreover, their pathogenic role was proven by using complementation assays on immortalized fibroblasts from patients and, for the <italic>VARS2</italic> mutation, on a specific recombinant yeast model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Informed consent, approved by the Ethical Committee of the Foundation IRCCS Istituto Neurologico &#8220;C.Besta&#8221;, Milan, Italy, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, was signed by the parents of the patients.</p><sec><title>Patient 1 (P1)</title><p>P1 is an 8-year-old patient, born at the 37th week of gestation by normal delivery.

No appreciable difference in aminoacylation level was found for leucyl-tRNA between control, P1, and P2 fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>F; Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast Studies</title><p>To test the possible deleterious effect of the mutations found in humans, we used a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast model. However, this investigation was possible only for the <italic>VARS2</italic> but not for the <italic>TARS2</italic> gene. Yeast has two genes encoding threonyl-tRNA synthetases, <italic>THS1</italic> and <italic>MST1</italic>. <italic>THS1</italic> encodes a cytoplasmic isoform and a putative mitochondrial isoform, which aminoacylates only the canonical tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup>; <italic>MST1</italic> encodes the mitochondrial isoform, which aminoacylates both mt-tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> and the noncanonical mt-tRNAThr<sup>(UAG)</sup>, whose corresponding CUN codon encodes, in yeast but not in humans, threonine instead of leucine [Su et al., <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ling et al., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. The human Pro282 is conserved in Ths1, but not in Mst1, which lacks the N-terminal region containing this amino acid. Introduction of the corresponding mutation in <italic>THS1</italic> would not affect mtDNA-dependent protein synthesis, since the mitochondrial enzyme Mst1 is present and can aminoacylate all the mt-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup>, whereas introduction of mutant (or wt) <italic>THS1</italic> in a <italic>MST1&#916;</italic> strain would not allow the mtDNA-dependent protein synthesis since the mt-tRNA<sup>Thr(UAG)</sup> would not be aminoacylated, and CUN codons would not be translated.</p><p>Contrariwise, the mutated Thr367 residue in human <italic>VARS2</italic> is conserved in the yeast ortholog <italic>VAS1</italic> (Thr380). However, <italic>VAS1</italic> codes for both the cytosolic and mitochondrial valyl tRNA-synthetases. We disrupted <italic>VAS1</italic> by homologous recombination and reexpressed the wt cytosolic isoform, thus generating a viable but OXPHOS incompetent strain (<italic>cytvas1</italic>), which lacked the mitochondrial isoform. In this strain, we expressed either the wt <italic>VAS1</italic> gene (<italic>VAS1</italic>), or a Thr380Ile mutant allele (<italic>vas1<sup>T380I</sup></italic>), equivalent to the human Thr367Ile mutation (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>The strain expressing <italic>vas1<sup>T380I</sup></italic> showed a division time in ethanol higher than the strain expressing <italic>VAS1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>), suggesting an OXPHOS-dependent growth defect. Accordingly, the respiration rate in <italic>vas1<sup>T380I</sup></italic> strain was slightly but significantly lower than in <italic>VAS1</italic> strain (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). No obvious alterations were observed in the in vivo mitochondrial protein synthesis assay (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Interestingly, the supplementation of valine (40 &#956;g/ml) in the culture medium led to normalization of the division time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>) and recovery of respiration for <italic>vas1<sup>T380I</sup></italic> strain (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), suggesting that Thr380 maps to the substrate binding site and its substitution with Ile380 yields a Km defect.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Yeast growth studies.

To avoid discrepancies in the measurements, due to culture passages of primary fibroblasts, we used immortalized P1 and P2 cell lines.

We and others have reported a strict genotype&#8211;phenotype correlation for most of these conditions [Edvardson et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Scheper et al., <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Sasarman et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Steenweg et al., <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. Since these genetic defects involve ubiquitously expressed enzymes all engaged in the very same enzymatic step of mitochondrial translation, the mechanisms leading to such different cellular and tissue-specific phenotypes remain unexplained. Different hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the clinical variability associated with different <italic>aaRS2</italic> mutations, but none seems to explain all aspects of this phenomenon that is probably the result of several mechanisms altered in <italic>aaRS2</italic> mutant patients [Konovalova and Tyynismaa, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>].</p><p>However, and similar to our <italic>VARS2</italic> and <italic>TARS2</italic> mutations, most mutations in <italic>aaRS2</italic> genes have been reported in single, or in just a few, cases, which hampers the establishment of definitive genotype to phenotype correlation. For instance, <italic>AARS2</italic> mutations were initially described as associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two families, but were later found also in patients with leukoencephalopathy and no heart involvement [Dallabona et al., <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>]. Nevertheless, encephalopathy is the most common presentation in <italic>aaRS2</italic> mutations, as in several other OXPHOS disorders, probably because of the high energy request by the central nervous system. For instance, mutations in <italic>DARS2</italic> (MIM# 610956) (mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) have been identified as a recurrent cause of leukoencephalopathy with brainstem, spinal cord involvement, and lactate elevation, whereas <italic>EARS2</italic> mutations (MIM# 612799) (mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase) are associated with a leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia 6, a severe infantile encephalopathy with cerebral atrophy and multiple OXPHOS deficiency, is associated with <italic>RARS2</italic> (MIM# 611524) (mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase) mutations. Complex rearrangements in <italic>MARS2</italic> (mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase) were described in a cohort of patients with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia with leukoencephalopathy, whereas mutations in <italic>FARS2</italic> (MIM# 611592) (Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase) were identified in three patients with fatal epileptic mitochondrial encephalopathy, consistent with Alpers&#8217; syndrome. Interestingly, specific MRI patterns seem to be associated with some <italic>aaRS2</italic> (e.g., <italic>DARS2</italic>, <italic>EARS2</italic>, <italic>RARS2</italic>) mutant patients. In our cases, P1 MRI showed hyperintense lesions involving mainly the insulae and frontotemporal right cortex, whereas P2 MRI was reported to show thinning of corpus callosum (a neuroimaging finding common to several neurodegenerative disorders) and bilateral lesions of the globi pallidi. However, the MRI of P3, brother of P2, was normal, although this can be due to the very early age at which this exam was performed. Additional <italic>VARS2</italic> and <italic>TARS2</italic> cases will clarify whether these MRI patterns are specific or not.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>aaRS2</italic>, impairing the translation of the 13 mtDNA-encoded MRC subunits, should in principle be associated with a biochemical deficiency of all MRC complexes, except cII. This biochemical profile was indeed found in muscle samples from the two <italic>TARS2</italic> mutant subjects (P2 and P3), whereas the <italic>VARS2</italic> mutant muscle (P1) showed isolated cI deficiency. Complex I seems to be particularly prone to damage in mtDNA translation defects, as already reported for <italic>MARS2</italic> in patients&#8217; cells and in the corresponding mutant fly model [Bayat et al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>] or for mutations in other proteins involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis, such as mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA-formyltransferase [Haack et al., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. This propensity can partly be explained by the fact that seven of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins are subunits of cI, and by the complexity of its functional and structural interactions. In patients&#8217; fibroblasts, biochemical assays of individual MRC complexes showed inconsistent alterations, indicating partial preservation of functional proficiency of the mutant enzyme or reflecting the (partial) dispensability from OXPHOS of this cell type. The same biochemical discrepancy has also been reported for mutations in other mt-aaRSs [Gotz et al., <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Bayat et al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sasarman et al., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. However, we observed a consistent biochemical phenotype in both na&#239;ve and immortalized mutant fibroblasts by measuring whole mitochondrial respiration, especially in culturing conditions that force cells to rely on OXPHOS to produce energy. As already reported for <italic>EARS2</italic> mutant fibroblasts, a diminished oxygen consumption rate is likely to depend on the cumulative impairment of the entire set of MRC complexes [Steenweg et al., <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]. We proved the pathogenic role of the mutations identified in <italic>VARS2</italic> and <italic>TARS2</italic> by showing decreased levels of aminoacylation of the cognate mitochondrial tRNAs and by complementing the biochemical defects in patients&#8217; fibroblasts expressing the corresponding wt cDNAs. This evidence was further corroborated for the <italic>VARS2</italic> mutation by concordant results obtained in a recombinant yeast model.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified novel mutations in two genes encoding mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (<italic>VARS2</italic> and <italic>TARS2</italic>), which have not been appreciated previously as causing mitochondrial disease, thus expanding the list of <italic>aaRS2</italic>-associated diseases. We also confirmed the value of WES for the identification of disease-causing genes even in single patients presenting heterogeneous clinical syndromes but with a biochemically detectable &#8220;mitochondrial signature.&#8221;</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Susanna Casellato, Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, University Hospital, Sassari, Italy, for her care for patient 1.
