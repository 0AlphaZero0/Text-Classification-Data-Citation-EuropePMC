and are expressed in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and vomeronasal organ (VO). Even in the well-studied
rodents, it is unclear which members of the V1R family cause sexual polymorphisms, as there are numerous genes
and it is difficult to quantify their expressions individually. Bovine species carry only 34 V1R homologs, and
the OE and VOs are large enough to sample. Here, V1R expression was quantified in the OE and VOs of individual
bovines. Based on the 34 gene sequences, we obtained a molecular dendrogram consisting of four clusters and
six independent branches. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to obtain gene expression profiles in the VOs and
OE of 5 Japanese Black bulls, 5 steers, 7 estrous heifers and 6 early luteal-phase heifers. Ten genes showed
significant between-group differences, and 22 showed high expression in VOs than in OE. The bulls showed
higher expression of one gene more in OE and another in VOs (both <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) than did steers;
both genes belonged to the first cluster. No genes were expressed more abundantly in steers than in bulls. The
estrous heifers showed higher expression of a gene of the second cluster in OE, and a gene of the third
cluster in VOs (both <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) than did early luteal-phase heifers. These results suggest
V1R expression exhibits sexual polymorphisms in cattle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendrogram</kwd><kwd>olfactory epithelium</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal 1 receptor family</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal organ</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Intraspecies chemosignals, including pheromones, play an important role in social and reproductive behavior and
physiology in mammals [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Vomeronasal 1 receptors (V1R) are a family of
receptors for intraspecies chemosignals that have been well characterized in rodents. Rodents also express
vomeronasal 2 receptors (V2R) genes, which are silenced in cows and humans [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. V1R family homologs are expressed in neurons in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and vomeronasal organ
(VO) of goats [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Individual
OE or VO neurons express only one or a few numbers of V1R or V2R [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sex differences in intraspecies
chemosignal detection have been reported [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, better
understanding of the expression of V1R will give improved insight into the evolution of intraspecies chemical
communication and the perception of sex-specific intraspecies chemosignals.</p><p>Comparative genomic techniques have identified V1R family members in several species, although it is unclear
which receptors are expressed in males and which in females. The V1R family is too large in mice, which carry 530
annotated V1R genes [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the size of the VO is insufficient to permit
quantitative expression analysis in individual animals. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to quantify full
transcriptomes of the mouse VO and OE, but pooled samples were required (VOs from three mice [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; OE from eight mice [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). In
addition, RNAseq data for olfactory receptor genes have yielded conflicting results. Ibarra-Soria <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that overall transcript levels are similar in
OE between male and female mice, whereas Shiao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]
suggested higher expression in males than in females.</p><p>Intraspecies chemosignals and receptors in bovines have not been extensively studied. However, pheromone-like
volatile compounds are found in female feces [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], skin and urine [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which induce Flehmen behavior and penile erection in male water buffalos. Urine and vaginal mucus
obtained from estrous cows slightly suppress LH secretion in heifers [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
Skins of estrous Japanese Black cows (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) have greater levels of several volatile
compounds in comparison to early luteal-phase cows [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Further details of
cattle pheromones have recently been reviewed by Archunan <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, bovines also may communicate using intraspecies chemosignals and V1Rs.</p><p>We recently performed <italic>in silico</italic> mining of the bovine genome database and discovered 34 V1R
family homologs. We also obtained sufficient mRNA from the OE and VOs of individuals in a preliminary trial. Thus,
the aim of the present study was to quantify and compare the expression of V1R genes in the OE and VOs of bulls,
steers, and estrous and early luteal-phase heifers.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Experiments were performed in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Experimental

the top of molecular dendrogram.</p><p><italic>Collecting VOs and OE from bulls and steers</italic>: We collected VOs and OE from healthy, intact
Japanese Black bulls (n=5, 46 &#177; 6 months old, 838 &#177; 11 kg) and Japanese Black steers (n=5, 28 &#177; 1 months old,
698 &#177; 12 kg) in a local slaughterhouse according to a previous anatomical study [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Water and mineral blocks were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Italian ryegrass hay, rice
straw and concentrate were provided according to the Japanese feeding standard [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Absence of disease, including reproductive disease, was confirmed by daily observation. The steers
were castrated at 8 months old. It is generally difficult to obtain sufficient number of bull samples in any
country. The bulls were used for &#8220;Sumo&#8221; wrestling in western Japan and were very healthy&#8212;they were being
sacrificed after losing wrestling rank, not for health reasons. Presence or absence of testis was confirmed in
each bull or steer at the slaughterhouse. The heads were placed on ice within 5 min of slaughter. VOs and OE
were obtained within 15 min of slaughter using a disk grinder with a diamond blade, hammer, straight gouge and
scissors. The tissues surrounding the VOs and OE were carefully removed and washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The VOs and OE were frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at &#8722;80&#176;C until use for RNA
extraction.</p><p><italic>Collecting VOs and OE from heifers</italic>: We collected VOs and OE from Japanese Black heifers in
estrus (n=7, 30 &#177; 1 months old, 506 &#177; 10 kg) or early luteal phase (n=6, 30 &#177; 1 months old, 505 &#177; 10 kg). Water
and mineral blocks were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Italian ryegrass hay and concentrate were provided
according to the Japanese feeding standard [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Absence of disease,
including reproductive disease, was confirmed by daily observation. All heifers had received two intramuscular
injections of 20 mg dinoprost (Pronalgon F, Pfizer, Tokyo, Japan) given 11 days apart to synchronize the estrous
cycle. Estrous behavior and ovulation were monitored at the farm; ovarian and uterine morphology were confirmed
at the slaughterhouse. The VOs and OE were collected from the heifers and stored as described above.</p><p><italic>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and semi-quantitative PCR</italic>: Total RNA was extracted from frozen
VO and OE samples with RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) according to manufacturer&#8217;s protocols. The RNA
solution was extracted a second time with RNAiso Plus, because single extraction yielded a brown product that
inhibited RT-PCR that could only be removed by a second extraction (preliminary study, data not shown). We could
not use a column method for RNA extraction due to the mucus and brown powder in the VO and OE samples. Total RNA
samples were digested with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA
concentration and purity were evaluated by using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.) to ensure the A260/A280 nm ratio was in the acceptable range of 1.8&#8211;2.1. Electrophoresis
of total RNA followed by staining with ethidium bromide was performed to verify mRNA quality; the 28S:18S ratios
were 2:1. We synthesized cDNA from 2 <italic>&#181;</italic>g RNA in 20-<italic>&#181;l</italic> reactions with random
hexamer primers and the precise High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, U.S.A.). PCR conditions were optimized by conventional PCR with Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio), 20
<italic>n</italic>g DNase-treated reverse-transcribed RNA, a Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) and
primers. Experiments included a no-template control and a no reverse transcription control. In preliminary
experiments, the optimum cycle number was determined for each target, so that signals were always in the
exponential portion of the amplification curve. Typical cycling conditions were as follows: 94&#176;C for 1 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 98&#176;C for 10 sec, 60&#176;C for 15 sec and 68&#176;C for 30 sec.</p><p>Primers were designed with Primer Express Software v3.0 (Applied Biosystems) and reference sequences. All
primers were produced by a commercial service (Fasmac Co., Ltd., Atsugi, Japan). <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the 34 V1R homologs and primers. Amplicons for most targets were 300 bp
with the following exceptions: Gene 2 (280 bp), Gene 3 (220 bp), Gene 6 (210 bp), Gene 10 (210 bp), Gene 13 (217
bp), Gene 14 (320 bp), Gene 15 (383 bp), Gene 16 (200 bp), Gene 23 (338 bp), Gene 24 (220 bp) and Gene 26 (250
bp). The presence of a single product was confirmed by 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Molecular weight markers ranging from 0.1 to 20 kbp (Gene Ladder Wide 1; Nippon Gene,
Tokyo, Japan) were used to identify the bands. PCR products were visualized with a highly sensitive fluorescent
stain (Gelstar, Lonza, Allendale, NJ, U.S.A.) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging system (GelDoc; Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, U.S.A.), and the sensitivity of this system against double-strand DNA was 20 pg.</p><p>PCR product concentrations were calculated by comparing the band strength of the unknown samples to the
molecular weight markers using Alphaview software (Proteinsimple, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.). V1R gene expression
was normalized to the geometric means of two housekeeping genes, chromosome 2 open reading frame 29 (C2orf29;
XM_002691150.2) and suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12; NM_001205587.1); values for each gene were divided by the
geometric mean of C2orf29 and SUZ12 in each sample. The primers for C2orf29 and SUZ12 were reported elsewhere
[<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>All PCR-amplified products were purified with the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Takara Bio) and
ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A.), and then sequenced the Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
on an ABI3130 (Applied Biosystems). The obtained sequences were used as query terms for homology searches in the
DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank using the basic nucleotide local alignment search tool (BLAST) optimized for highly
similar sequences (available on the NCBI website).</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Data were analyzed using Statview version 5.0 for Windows (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.). Two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of
organ (VO or OE), group (bulls, steers, estrous heifers or early luteal-phase heifers) and interaction between
the effects of organ and group on V1R gene expression followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher&#8217;s protected
least significant difference (PLSD) test. The statistical significance of differences among groups was assessed
by one-factor ANOVAs followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher&#8217;s PLSD test using a model consisting of
variance from the effect of group and the residual. The level of significance was set at
<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. Data are expressed as mean &#177; SEM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>Molecular dendrogram of bovine homologous genes of V1R</italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The evolutionary history of the 34 bovine homologs of V1R was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method.

chemosignals and receptors in this species are poorly understood, the expression polymorphisms discovered herein
suggest the presence of multiple intraspecies chemosignals in females and males. The genomes of mice, bovines
and humans contain 530, 34 and 4 V1R family genes [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; thus, bovines represent a mid-point in the loss of V1R genes through
evolution. Therefore, the results of this study may give an insight into the evolution of such receptor genes in
mammals and their involvement in sex-specific behavior.</p><p>It is well known that there are sex differences in intraspecies chemosignal detection [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although the mechanisms for these sex differences were unknown in mammals prior to this
study. Indeed, sexual polymorphisms in V1R gene expression remain unknown in all mammalian species. Our study
results show higher gene expression in bulls than in estrous heifers (genes 1, 12, 17 and 33). In addition, we
also show higher gene expression in estrous heifers than in bulls (gene 26). Therefore, we believe that these
genes may be important causes of sex differences in intraspecies chemosignal detection. Our results also suggest
that different receptor clusters may have different roles and effects on the central nervous system. However, we
believe that other mechanisms for sex differences in intraspecies chemosignal detection may exist in cattle.
Indeed, a recent study, which was published after we completed our study, showed that progesterone can silence
sensory neurons detecting urinary protein pheromones in female mice [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The estrous heifers showed higher expression of Gene 9 in OE and Gene 15 in VOs in comparison to early
luteal-phase heifers. The VOs of early luteal-phase heifers showed higher expression of eight genes than those
of estrous heifers. These data suggest expression is dependent on estrous cycle stage. Blood estradiol is higher
in estrous heifers than in early luteal-phase heifers [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This and the
findings of Doty and Cameron [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggest estradiol may be one
controlling factor. Interestingly, mouse VO synthesizes estrogen, and the VO neuronal response to putative urine
pheromones is reduced by estradiol [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Two V2R genes may be controlled by
testosterone in male mice [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We found no previous reports on the effect
of sex steroids on V1R gene expression; however, the ability to detect putative human pheromone, androstenone,
is more likely to diminish in boys than in girls after puberty [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further studies are required
to test the hypothesis that estradiol and testosterone control sex-associated polymorphisms in V1R gene
expression.</p><p>The VOs expressed 22 genes more strongly than the OE. Little is known about V1R expression in ruminants. Ohara
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that all of the 24 identified V1R
genes are expressed in the VO and OE of a goat, the genome of which has not been fully sequenced. However, the
authors did not report on the characteristics of the goat (age, sex and intact or gonadectomized), and they used
nested PCR (both first and second PCRs were 35 cycles) to evaluate gene expression. Therefore, it is impossible
to compare our data with theirs. Sniffing is the behavioral response for pheromone binding to the OE receptors,
and Flehmen is the behavioral response for pheromone binding to the VO receptors. In general, bulls and cows
show Flehmen responses after sniffing [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the smaller number
of ligand-receptor binding sites on the OE may be enough to induce the Flehmen response, and a higher number of
ligand-receptor binding sites on the VOs may be interpreted (or treated) by the accessory olfactory bulb and
lead to various neurological and behavioral effects in cattle [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The effect of group was not significant for the 20 V1R genes. Sexual pheromones induce male and female effects
to activate reproductive functions in the opposite sex in small ruminants [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, an
intraspecies chemosignal was reported in Dorsett ewes, which utilize their VO for neonatal offspring recognition
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rats have the ability to communicate affective states, such as
stress, alarm, fear, anxiety or sexual interest, by releasing intraspecies chemosignals [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, some of the 20 V1Rs may have
important roles in the detection of intraspecies chemosignals for non-sexual purposes.</p><p>We compared the expression of each of 30 V1Rs in the VO and OE among the 4 different groups. Individual gene
expression patterns did not show uniformity. Because all 30 V1Rs are orphan receptors, it is impossible to
explain the precise characteristics of each receptor and explain the relationship with each physiological change
or gene expression requirement. However, generally, physiological responses and decisions of animals are in
response to situations in their living environment and for survival and species conservation. Intraspecies
chemosignals have sexual and non-sexual purposes [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Rodents can discriminate among conspecific
animals based on various sensory cues, including dietary history [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>],
illness-associated state [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and major histocompatibility complex [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, expression patterns of V1Rs may have important roles in
complex intraspecific chemical communication.</p><p>Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase possesses high fidelity and excellent extension activity, because it contains a
specific priming accelerator that suppresses non-specific binding, Takara Bio&#8217;s original strong elongation
factor and reaction buffer elements that sequester PCR inhibitors. Thus, the polymerase can amplify templates
from over a wide range of nucleic acid concentrations, even from targets containing GC- or AT-rich sequences. In
our preliminary trials, PCR amplification failed, likely because of inhibiting contaminants, and we subsequently
evaluated several cDNA reverse transcription kits and enzymes and concluded that the high-capacity cDNA reverse
transcription kit and Tks Gflex provided the best PCR results.</p><p>Ibarra-Soria <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] used RNAseq to quantify whole
transcriptomes of the mouse VO and OE; however, they measured only one VIR gene among the 530 annotated V1R
genes by using real-time PCR with a commercial primer and probe set. The amplicon size was 59 bp for the
commercial primer and probe set; however, the sequences of primers and probe in the set were not specified.
Thus, it was impossible to compare the homology of the 59-bp amplified products with that of the other 529
genes. In this study, we did not include any real-time PCR analysis data, because first, we did not obtain a
product by using Tks Gflex, which could be because of the high risk of failure to amplify due to the presence of
inhibiting contaminants. Second, it is difficult to ensure specificity, because of the high level of sequence
similarity within the V1R family [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Third, for precise real-time PCR
analysis results, the amplicon size must be less than 150 bp (and more than 50 bp) [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, such small amplicon size is insufficient to obtain sequence data for BLAST
search to identify the gene. Fourth, the manufacturer of the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, namely,
Applied Biosystems, advised us that the excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescent dyes used in
real-time PCR kits are almost similar to those of the fluorescent dyes used in the Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit. Therefore, the manufacturer was unable to guarantee the quality of the sequence data of the
amplified products obtained by real-time PCR. Therefore, we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR followed by sequencing
for identification of the expressed gene in the present study; however, we must be cautious, because
quantification by using semi-quantitative RT-PCRs may not always be accurate.</p><p>Typically, mRNA expression does not accurately reflect protein expression. In addition, the number of receptors
on the cell surface is not solely controlled by their mRNA expressions. Therefore, specific antibodies to
extra-cellular regions of each receptor must be developed to clarify the role and importance of each V1R.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we discovered sexual polymorphisms of V1R expressions among bulls, steers, and
estrous and early luteal-phase heifers. This is the first report of sexual polymorphisms of V1R expression in
ruminant species and the first reported estrous stage-dependent difference of V1R expression in any mammalian
species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was partly supported by a Grant-in Aid for Scienti&#64257;c Research from Yamaguchi
