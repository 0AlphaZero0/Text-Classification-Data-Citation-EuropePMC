To be eligible, women must have used insulin during pregnancy or present intermediate hyperglycemia postpartum. Women are encouraged to enter the trial as early as 10&#160;weeks, and are permitted to do so up to 2&#160;years after a pregnancy with GDM. An estimated 740 women will be randomized to either conventional care or to coach-based interventions focused on breastfeeding, weight loss, healthy eating, and increased physical activity, and predominantly delivered by telephone.

Diabetes can be prevented, as shown by two landmark clinical trials, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS): an average of three years of lifestyle interventions can reduce by 58&#160;% the incidence of type 2 diabetes in individuals presenting impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subgroup analyses of one of these trials, focusing on women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), found a 53&#160;% reduction at the end of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and a 35&#160;% reduction 10&#160;years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>GDM, a hyperglycemic state detected during pregnancy, is an established risk factor for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but treatment during pregnancy in and of itself is not able to eliminate its risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although a clinical trial showed that troglitazone could reduce diabetes incidence by 55&#160;% when applied to very high risk women with GDM, the drug was subsequently withdrawn from the market due to serious adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>More recent randomized trials are testing the effect of lifestyle interventions after pregnancy among women with GDM with the aim of preventing diabetes. One such trial randomized 450 women with GDM and impaired glucose tolerance postpartum in China and found that the incidence of diabetes did not differ between the intervention (15&#160;%) and the control group (19&#160;%), after 36&#160;months of follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Four other trials are ongoing. One, in China, is randomizing 1180 women with GDM diagnosed over a prior 5-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another, in Australia, is randomizing women at postpartum with the aim of reducing diabetes risk at 12&#160;months postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A third is a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial of 44 medical facilities at Kaiser Permanente Northern California including 2320 women with GDM, having as primary outcomes postpartum weight goals at 6 and 12&#160;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, an additional randomized trial is testing the efficacy of an individually-tailored lifestyle intervention to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among postpartum Hispanic women with a history of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for the trial and for the choice of the interventions</title><p>Given the increased burden of diabetes worldwide, preventive actions are urgently needed. Lifestyle modifications have been shown to be effective in the prevention of diabetes when offered to high risk middle-age individuals, but identification of those at risk is challenging. Pregnancy is a good opportunity to identify women at risk since glucose testing is routinely done for the detection of gestational diabetes. Since retesting at postpartum is also routinely recommended for these women, those found to be at higher risk can be targeted for early diabetes prevention. Moreover, lifestyle interventions are usually implemented during pregnancy for the treatment of gestational diabetes. Since women frequently abandon these lifestyle changes after pregnancy, interventions to encourage a healthy lifestyle are needed and must be tailored to the postpartum period so as to take into account the difficulties involved in this setting of adapting to the needs of the new baby.</p><p>Motivational interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and other communication strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] may help tailor the intervention to women&#8217;s health needs and stimulate behavioral change in the context of coping with the demands of motherhood. The choice of the interventions must be focused on the potential benefits for these women at this particular phase of their lives. In this regard, a few interventions are especially suitable, as discussed below.</p><p>Breastfeeding, a healthy behavior in and of itself, has been associated with improved maternal metabolic profiles when assessed by observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Breastfeeding was associated with lower blood glucose levels 6&#8211;12 weeks postpartum in women with GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], greater postpartum weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], lower risk of obesity in the long run, as well as lower risk for the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Breastfeeding exclusively for 6&#160;months, and to any extent for 12&#160;months, reduced weight retention at 6&#160;months postpartum, irrespective of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI); and at 18&#160;months postpartum in women with BMI&#8201;&lt;&#8201;35&#160;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, a decreased risk of diabetes has been found for breastfeeding women with and without GDM, although not in all studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Despite these potential benefits, obese women have shorter lengths of exclusive and overall breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and those obese and also with diabetes or GDM, lower rates of intending and initiating breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Weight control interventions to facilitate achieving pre-pregnancy weight and further weight loss at postpartum are fundamental for the prevention of diabetes, as major diabetes prevention trials have shown that a loss of about 5&#160;% of body weight is associated with a decreased incidence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Pre-pregnancy weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], pregnancy weight gain and retention of weight at postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are common and important risk factors for type 2 diabetes in GDM women. A recent Brazilian pregnancy cohort reported excessive weight gain in 44.8&#160;% of women, being more frequent among those who were overweight prior to pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The same study found median weight retention at 4&#8211;6 months postpartum of 4.4&#160;kg, with 33&#160;% of women moving to a higher BMI category and an additional 15&#160;% of women who were already overweight gaining additional weight without a change of BMI category.</p><p>Evidence summarized by a Subcommittee on Nutrition During Lactation (Institute of Medicine) shows that lactating women typically lose weight at the rate of 0.5 to 1.0&#160;kg per month in the first 4 to 6&#160;months of lactation, probably related to physiologic changes during this period. The Committee also noted that some women lose as much as 2&#160;kg per month and successfully maintain milk volume. The Subcommittee recommended that during lactation daily energy intake should not be restricted to less than 1800&#160;kcal and especially not to less than 1500&#160;kcal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Further studies have demonstrated that to promote a weight loss of 2&#160;kg/month (0.5&#160;kg/week), overweight lactating women may restrict their usual energy intake by 500&#160;kcal/day and exercise aerobically 4 days/week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A Cochrane systematic review supports the feasibility and safety of moderate dietary restrictions (alone or in combination with exercise) for postpartum weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A further systematic review demonstrated that exercise strategies in postpartum women, with or without dietary intervention, improve weight loss compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A recent trial based on 2.5&#160;h of individual sessions and biweekly phone interaction to stimulate weight loss through healthy diet and physical activity found that a 12-weeks intervention in lactating women (overweight or obese before pregnancy) produced an average weight loss of 8.3&#160;kg shortly after the intervention and of 10.2&#160;kg at 1-y follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with improvement of cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, given the high level of education of these women, it is important to consider also the more modest effects observed in a pilot study of lifestyle interventions for women with GDM during pregnancy and the postpartum period, oriented mostly by phone, which was conducted in a less favorable socioeconomic context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The DPP and the DPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], focused their dietary interventions on a decrease in calories and fats, especially saturated fats, and the DPS also on an increase in fiber. However, it is also important to consider new knowledge that has developed since the publication of these studies. An intervention based on a Mediterranean diet, supplemented with either olive oil or nuts, was more effective than a low-fat diet in the prevention of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Systematic reviews of observational studies suggest that increased consumption of red meat and especially processed meat are related to a higher incidence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and that increased consumption of dairy products is related to a lower incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Additionally, a systematic review of observational studies has strengthened the evidence that increased consumption of food rich in fiber is associated to a lower incidence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Consumption of ultra-processed foods, likely to play an important role in the current obesity epidemic, may also be related to the incidence of diabetes. In Brazil, sugars, margarine, salt and pasta already seasoned for preparation, as well as ultra-processed foods (fast foods and convenience foods such as snacks and desserts which are pre-prepared and ready-to-eat) are increasingly being consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and ultra-processed foods have been found to be associated with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Artificial sweeteners, frequently used in Brazil to sweeten coffee and tea, have been recently shown to drive the development of glucose intolerance in rodents through direct compositional and functional alterations in the intestinal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In humans the association between artificially sweetened beverage intake and glycemic level is inconsistent, and positive associations have been suggested to be due to reverse causality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Coffee (independent of being decaffeinated or not) as well as tea consumption have been related to lower risk for diabetes in meta-analyses of observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Although both are a major source of anti-oxidants and coffee has anti-inflammatory effects, the physiologic basis for a purported effect is still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Small, short term (weeks) clinical trials have shown mainly negative results. The longest (16&#160;weeks) trial, however, showed a slight, though questionable, benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moderate maternal consumption of caffeine during lactation does not appear to adversely affect the newborn, although more studies are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>Finally, advances in the use of internet and telephone-based interactions can facilitate interventions in the postpartum period, as they permit a more home-based approach. In at least one study these strategies have been found to be as effective as face-to-face coaching in achieving weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Additionally, barriers to successfully treatment of obesity in low resource settings may be overcome by the use of technology-assisted weight loss interventions. A recent systematic review has shown that compared to usual care, technology-assisted interventions in the primary care setting help patients achieve weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention program in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes when implemented after a pregnancy complicated by GDM in women identified as being at higher risk.</p><p>Additionally, we aim to investigate factors related to success or failure in diabetes prevention, to develop materials and expertise to assist in the development of diabetes prevention programs, and to contribute to public policies for diabetes prevention in primary health care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>LINDA-Brasil is a multicenter randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention program (of 18 to 60&#160;months) in delaying or preventing type 2 diabetes when implemented shortly (10&#160;weeks to 2&#160;years) after a pregnancy complicated by GDM in women identified as being at higher risk (use of insulin during pregnancy and or post-partum lesser-than-diabetes hyperglycemia).

Given that follow up the participants occurs at yearly intervals, we do not require confirmation of the diabetes status on another day to ascertain incident diabetes in order to avoid an excessive length of time prior to the initiation of medical care for diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p>We estimated that the control group will have a cumulative 3-year diabetes incidence rate of 25&#160;%. This estimate lies between a lower rate (19&#160;%) found in a trial involving women considerably leaner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and higher rates found in two trials: a trial of a very high risk postpartum group (36&#160;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and another trial involving older women, enrolled a decade after their first pregnancy with GDM (38&#160;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We also assume that the intervention will produce a reduction of 40&#160;% in diabetes incidence over three years. This estimated effect is lower than the incidence reduction observed in the DPP subgroup analysis (53&#160;%), consistent with our anticipated intervention&#8217;s effect, and clinically meaningful for the prevention of diabetes in Brazil. The number needed to treat to prevent one case of diabetes is 10 (1/(.25-.15). Under an exponential model, the relative risk of 0.60 comparing intervention to control corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.565.</p><p>We based our sample size calculation on a Cox proportional hazards model test of a one-sided primary hypothesis (no difference between treatments in incidence of type 2 diabetes) at the 0.025 level, with 90&#160;% power, using the package RCTdesign in the software R, version 2.14. Utilizing a group sequential design, we plan for four analyses, three interim and one final with symmetric O&#8217;Brien-Fleming boundaries for efficacy and futility to be spaced evenly in information time. This analysis shows that 135 observed events in both arms are needed at the time of final analysis to have 90&#160;% power to detect a true hazard ratio of 0.565. Assuming an annual drop-out rate of 5&#160;%, an average monthly recruitment of 18 participants, and requiring an average follow-up time of three years if the study continues to the final analysis, we calculated a total sample size of 740 for the trial.</p><p>To enroll this number of women, we estimate that up to 7400 women will have to be initially screened. If we are unable to maintain our monthly recruitment goals with the strategy outlined above, we will consider other means of recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The trial protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital de Cl&#237;nicas de Porto Alegre (Project 120097, May 4, 2012). Written consent is obtained at initial recruitment and then again, before enrollment to the trial. At randomization we explain to the participants that they will have equal chances of being entered into one or the other group. We also explain that it is not known whether applying a more intense intervention relatively soon after postpartum is more beneficial than the conventional approach. However, if the Study finds that it is indeed more beneficial, then at study close-out those who did not receive the more intense approach will be informed about how to undertake the activities found to be successful. While we emphasize the importance of maintaining participation throughout the study so as to minimize bias in the trial results, women are informed that they may request to terminate participation if they so decide. Those who drop out of the study will nevertheless have their available follow-up time included in analysis of treatment effects. Women found to have developed diabetes will be notified and oriented to seek medical attention to confirm diagnosis and initiate treatment.</p><p>A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will monitor efficacy (or futility) and adverse effects. Based on these considerations, the DSMB may recommend that the protocol be modified or that the LINDA trial be terminated. The DSMB will consist of experts in relevant biomedical fields, biostatistics and medical ethics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Final considerations</title><p>After testing&#160;instruments and piloting strategies and procedures, we initiated trial recruitment and randomization in January, 2015.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is one of the few randomized trials designed to prevent diabetes by intervening shortly after delivery of women with GDM.
