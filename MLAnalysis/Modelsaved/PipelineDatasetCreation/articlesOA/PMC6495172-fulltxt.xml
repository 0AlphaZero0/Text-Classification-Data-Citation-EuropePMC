Genetic and drug-induced lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are associated with increased BMP concentrations in tissues and in the circulation. Data on BMP in disorders other than LSDs, however, are scarce, and key enzymes regulating BMP metabolism remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that common metabolic disorders and the intracellular BMP hydrolase &#945;/&#946;-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) affect BMP metabolism in mice and humans. In mice, dietary lipid overload strongly affects BMP concentration and FA composition in the liver and plasma, similar to what has been observed in LSDs. Notably, distinct changes in the BMP FA profile enable a clear distinction between lipid overload and drug-induced LSDs. Global deletion of ABHD6 increases circulating BMP concentrations but does not cause LSDs. In humans, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver cirrhosis affect the serum BMP FA composition and concentration. Furthermore, we identified a patient with a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>ABHD6</italic> gene, leading to an altered circulating BMP profile. In conclusion, our results suggest that common metabolic diseases and ABHD6 affect BMP metabolism in mice and humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>lysosomal storage disorders</kwd><kwd>phospholipids</kwd><kwd>lysobisphosphatidic acid</kwd><kwd>&#945;/&#946;-hydrolase domain-containing 6</kwd><kwd>lipase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="open-funder-registry">10.13039/501100002428</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">P26166</award-id><award-id rid="sp1">KLI521-B31</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), also known as lysobisphosphatidic acid, is a phospholipid consisting of two phosphate-linked glycerol molecules in an unusual <italic>sn</italic>-1 glycerophospho-s<italic>n</italic>-1&#8242; glycerol stereoconformation, with each glycerol esterified with a single FA (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). BMP is found in the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of late endosomes and lysosomes and plays an important role in their structure and function. It is produced during the maturation of endosomes, which acquire ILVs through the inward budding of the outer membrane, leading to a multivesicular appearance. BMP favors the formation of ILVs (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and accounts for approximately 15 mol% of total phospholipids in late endosomes (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Due to its exceptional structure, BMP is resistant to degradation by acid phospholipases and forms a docking station for lysosomal proteins. It is negatively charged at an acidic pH, facilitating the binding of positively charged hydrolases and lipid-binding proteins to ILVs (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Based on these properties, BMP plays a central role in cargo sorting by stimulating the degradation and sorting of lipids.</p><p>Various genetic lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Niemann-Pick disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, and Wolman disease, are associated with BMP accumulation in tissues (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of undigested material in lysosomes due to a deficiency of degradative enzymes or defects in lysosomal transport. Tissue BMP accumulation occurs secondary to a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in acidic organelles and counteracts the pathological accumulation of lipids in these organelles (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In LSDs, BMP is also elevated in the circulation and can be used as a diagnostic biomarker (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Analyzing serum BMP concentrations is particularly important in the diagnosis of a drug-induced LSD, also designated as drug-induced phospholipidosis. This disorder is caused by cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that accumulate within and disturb the function of lysosomes (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Today, almost 50 clinically relevant drugs are considered as CADs, and drug-induced phospholipidosis has become a major concern in drug development (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Despite its important role in physiology and pathophysiology, major aspects of BMP metabolism in health and disease remain elusive. Genes involved in BMP synthesis and degradation are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that the serine hydrolase &#945;/&#946;-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) exhibits BMP hydrolase activity in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of ABHD6 in mice resulted in elevated hepatic BMP content, which was further increased upon high-fat diet (HFD) feeding (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). ABHD6 was originally described as a monoglyceride (MG) hydrolase with an important function in endocannabinoid signaling (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). More recent studies, however, have shown its involvement in intracellular vesicle transport (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), energy and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and tumor metastasis (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although several loss-of-function SNPs are known for human ABHD6 (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), so far no patient with ABHD6 deficiency has been described.</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether lipid-enriched diets, frequently used in obesity and atherosclerosis research, affect BMP metabolism in mice. Furthermore, we analyzed the circulating BMP profile of patients with liver disease and characterized the role of ABHD6 in BMP metabolism in mice and humans.</p><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science, Research, and Economy (protocol numbers BMWF-66.007/7-ll/3b/2013 and BMWF-66.007/0002-ll/3b/2014) and the ethics committee of the University of Graz and conducted in compliance with the Council of Europe Convention (ETS 123).

Our results demonstrate that amiodarone and a WTD and HFD cause distinct alterations in hepatic and/or plasma BMP profiles, allowing a clear distinction between different treatments. Circulating BMP profiles under basal and pathophysiological conditions clearly differ from the hepatic profiles. This may be due to both selective release of distinct subspecies and secretion of BMP from the cells of different organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation and characterization of global ABHD6-deficient mice</title><p>Although changes in BMP concentrations in plasma and tissues are closely linked to lysosomal stress, very little is known about the molecular pathways regulating BMP metabolism. In fact, the rate-limiting enzymes catalyzing BMP synthesis and degradation remain elusive, and the mechanism of BMP secretion has not been investigated. We have previously shown that ABHD6 acts as an intracellular BMP hydrolase affecting hepatic BMP degradation (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To further investigate the role of ABHD6 in BMP metabolism under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, we generated mice globally lacking ABHD6. Mice were generated using embryonic stem cells from EUCOMM containing a LacZ cassette and a promotor-driven selection cassette (neo) in introns 3 and 4 of the <italic>Abhd6</italic> gene. The selection cassette as well as exons 4 and 5 of <italic>Abhd6</italic> were flanked by loxP sites. Mice bearing the targeted allele were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a cytomegalovirus promotor, resulting in the deletion of neo, exon 4, and exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). The loss of the ABHD6 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). A gross metabolic characterization of ABHD6 KO mice revealed no alterations in food intake, locomotor activity, oxygen consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production, and respiratory coefficient compared with WT controls in mice fed the chow diet (supplemental Fig. S1A&#8211;E). In accordance with published data, however, we observed that ABHD6 KO mice fed the HFD exhibited reduced body weight and liver acylglycerol content compared with WT controls (supplemental Fig. S1F, G) (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Resistance against diet-induced obesity has been shown to be caused by increased energy expenditure due to white adipose tissue browning (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Upon HFD feeding, ABHD6-deficient mice also exhibit reduced de novo lipogenesis in the liver that may counteract hepatic steatosis (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast to the HFD, no differences between genotypes were observed in the body weight and liver acylglycerol content in mice fed the chow diet or WTD or mice treated with amiodarone (supplemental Fig. S1F, G). ABHD6 has originally been identified as an MG hydrolase (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), with high expression in several tissues, including the brain (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). ABHD6 may thus affect the degradation of the major endocannabinoid 2-archidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which may lead to altered endocannabinoid signaling and neuronal transmission. Analysis of the MG profile in the brain, liver, and plasma revealed unchanged MG concentration and FA composition (supplemental Fig. S2A&#8211;C). To exclude that the lack of ABHD6 causes behavioral alterations in mice, we performed several behavioral tests. We assessed anxiety- and depression-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and forced swim test, social interaction in the three-chamber test, and spatial learning and memory performance in the Morris water maze. However, we could not observe differences between WT and ABHD6 KO mice in any of the aforementioned tests (supplemental Fig. S2D&#8211;G). These observations indicate that ABHD6 deficiency does not cause severe behavioral or metabolic alterations in mice fed a chow diet.</p><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Characterization of mice with global genetic ABHD6 deletion.

(<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) reported that HFD feeding in mice leads to the increased expression of ABHD6 in the liver and other tissues. In accordance with these data, we found that the HFD as well as the WTD and amiodarone led to increased protein expression of ABHD6 in the liver compared with chow-fed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>). The loss of ABHD6 activity resulted in a 70% decrease in BMP hydrolase activity detected in liver lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These observations indicate that ABHD6 substantially contributes to hepatic BMP degradation under basal and pathophysiological conditions. However, hepatic BMP content in ABHD6 KO mice remained unchanged with the chow diet and different treatments compared with the respective WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Importantly, however, we found that ABHD6 deficiency is associated with increased circulating BMP concentrations in mice that were fed the chow diet (2-fold), the chow diet supplemented with amiodarone (6-fold), and the WTD (2-fold) and HFD (2-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). In ABHD6 KO mice that were fed the chow diet, most of the detected BMP species were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Amiodarone-treated ABHD6 KO mice showed a strong increase in BMP 36:4, 40:8/2, and 44:12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>). ABHD6 KO mice fed the WTD or HFD showed an increase in several BMP subspecies. Most prominent were 44:12 and 36:2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). Elevated plasma BMP concentrations, as observed in ABHD6 KO mice, can indicate an LSD (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether ABHD6 KO mice exhibit changes in lysosome morphology. An analysis of liver samples by electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S3A<bold>)</bold> and laser-scanning microscopy using a specific label for acidic organelles (supplemental Fig. S3B) revealed no differences between genotypes. This suggests that genetic ABHD6 deficiency promotes BMP release into the circulation but is not associated with hepatic BMP accumulation and with the formation of the multilamellar bodies characteristic of LSDs (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><fig id="f3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Analysis of BMP concentrations in ABHD6 KO mice.

BMP is a major component of ILVs of late endosomes/lysosomes facilitating the degradation and sorting of cargo lipids (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It contains high amounts of DHA and other PUFAs, indicating that it may play a role in PUFA sorting in acidic organelles. BMP accumulates in genetic and drug-induced LSDs in various tissues and is also elevated in the circulation, indicating that lysosomal stress of a different origin affects BMP metabolism. Despite its central role in lipid sorting and its association with human disease, very little is known about BMP metabolism in common lipid-associated disorders other than LSDs, such as obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and atherosclerosis. Published work suggests that dietary lipid overload increases the hepatic (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and renal BMP content in mice (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and that serum BMP concentrations in humans are increased in ALC (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>HFDs and WTDs are frequently used experimental diets for inducing metabolic disorders in mice. Here we show that these diets substantially affect BMP concentrations in the liver and plasma of mice. The HFD had even more pronounced effects on BMP metabolism than amiodarone, which is considered as a prototypical drug inducing LSDs (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Strikingly, changes in BMP concentrations and FA composition allowed a clear distinction between treatments, suggesting that the serum BMP profile could represent a useful diagnostic marker for common lipid-associated disorders such as NAFLD, which affects 25% of the global adult population. Because serum biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD are urgently required (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we analyzed the serum BMP profile of patients with different stages of liver disease. Changes in BMP profiles were less pronounced as observed in mice fed the HFD or WTD. NAFL and NASH were associated with alterations in FA composition of the major circulating BMP species (36:2/3/4). These observations indicate that liver steatosis induces moderate changes in BMP metabolism independent of disease progression. We found no differences in BMP concentrations and FA composition between NAFL and NASH, indicating that an analysis of circulating BMP is not sufficient for monitoring disease progression. In cirrhotic patients, we observed increased plasma BMP concentrations in accordance with published data for ALC (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), mainly due to an increase of the BMP subspecies 36:3/4. Notably, plasma BMP concentrations in cirrhotic patients correlated with disease severity, and BMP might thus represent an interesting marker for end-stage liver disease.</p><p>The observed changes in BMP content and FA composition require enzymes catalyzing synthesis, degradation, and/or remodeling of BMP. Currently, little is known about the anabolic and catabolic pathways of BMP metabolism (<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the serine hydrolase ABHD6 exhibits BMP hydrolase activity and is responsible for most of the BMP hydrolase activity detected in liver lysates (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). ABHD6 is located at the ER and on the cytosolic side of outer membranes of late endosomes/lysosomes. The enzyme may be involved in remodeling outer membranes of late endosomes/lysosomes by hydrolyzing BMP and possibly other lipid substrates exported from these organelles (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The enzyme is upregulated in the liver in response to lysosomal stress induced by amiodarone and lipid-enriched diets, suggesting that it affects tissue BMP levels. Surprisingly, however, we observed unchanged hepatic BMP concentrations in ABHD6 KO mice, while circulating BMP concentrations were elevated. The lack of ABHD6 also potentiated amiodarone-, WTD, and HFD-induced elevations in plasma BMP, indicating that nonhydrolyzed BMP is released into the circulation.</p><p>To better understand the export mechanism of BMP, we examined whether circulating BMP is associated with exosomes, lipoproteins, or plasma proteins. Despite its high enrichment in ILVs, which represent precursors of exosomes (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), we exclusively found BMP in the HDL fraction of WT and ABHD6 KO mice. This suggests that BMP is rather released via HDL/ApoA1-dependent mechanisms, such as ABC transporters or scavenger receptor class B type 1, than via the exosomal pathway. In comparison, studies in humans have suggested that approximately 40% of plasma BMP is associated with lipoproteins but only 9% are found in the HDL fraction, indicating differences in BMP metabolism between species (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of BMP release and its transport in the circulation.</p><p>Human and mouse ABHD6 are capable of hydrolyzing BMP in vitro, and several point mutations in the human <italic>ABHD6</italic> have been reported that lead to the loss of enzyme activity (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A recent genetic study (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) in consanguineous populations identified candidate variants in 75 genes that were previously not associated with human disease. The <italic>ABHD6</italic> gene was among these candidate variants, with a homozygous single-nucleotide substitution in the coding region leading to an amino acid substitution (Y62S). The observed phenotype of the patient includes fine motor delay, speech delay, intellectual disability, and autistic features. It is currently unclear whether the <italic>ABHD6</italic> mutation is causal for the phenotype. Our data demonstrate that this <italic>ABHD6</italic> variant lacks BMP hydrolase activity. Furthermore, an analysis of the patient&#8217;s plasma revealed increased DHA-containing BMP subspecies. Notably, these were also the most elevated subspecies in ABHD6-deficient mice, indicating that ABHD6 affects BMP metabolism and release similarly in mice and humans.</p><p>ABHD6 was originally described as an MG hydrolase degrading the endocannabinoid 2-AG in addition to MG lipase, the major enzyme catalyzing 2-AG hydrolysis (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that the inactivation of ABHD6 protects against HFD-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and insulin resistance (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In accordance with these data, our results showed reduced body weight and hepatic steatosis in ABHD6 KO mice fed the HFD. The molecular mechanism behind these protective effects is incompletely understood. Zhao et al. (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) proposed that ABHD6 deficiency promotes adipose tissue browning via the activation of PPAR&#945;/&#947; by <italic>sn</italic>-1-monoacylglycerols. Alternatively, ABHD6 could regulate inflammatory pathways by degrading prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>-glycerol ester (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) or mobilizing arachidonic acid from 2-AG (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We could not detect differences in 2-AG and other MG species in the brain, liver, and plasma of ABHD6 KO mice, indicating that the enzyme does not substantially affect tissue and circulating MG levels. Nevertheless, ABHD6-dependent degradation of MG might be important in specialized cells or cellular compartments such as pancreatic &#946;-cells (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or postsynaptic membranes of neurons (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another study identified ABHD6 as a component of &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) complexes (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These complexes regulate the trafficking and functions of AMPARs that are localized in postsynaptic terminals, where they mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Changes in endocannabinoid or AMPAR signaling may affect neurotransmission, resulting in behavioral defects. Accordingly, we performed several standard behavioral tests but could not find any changes in behavioral, learning, and memory performance.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that commonly used atherogenic and obesity-inducing diets cause robust changes in hepatic and circulating BMP concentrations in mice. Considering that BMP is crucial for lysosomal lipid sorting and accumulates in LSDs, diet-induced alterations in BMP likely reflect lysosomal stress triggered by an increased lipid flux. In humans, liver disease alters the serum BMP profile depending on disease progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the BMP hydrolase ABHD6 affects circulating BMP profiles in mice and humans. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular pathways mediating BMP synthesis, degradation, and release. Understanding these processes will provide new insights into the regulation of lysosomal function as well as the pathogenesis of lysosomal dysfunction.</p></sec>
