</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative blood loss and red blood cell transfusions are associated with short- and long-term complications in liver surgery, such as operative mortality or major complications that require post-operative radiologic or surgical intervention [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Intra-operative blood loss also predisposes patients to post-resectional liver failure [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to avoid blood loss, the intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) is frequently applied in patients undergoing liver surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This implies intermittent clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament, thereby occluding hepatic inflow [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>IPM may have a negative effect on outcome after liver resection as a consequence of liver injury due to ischemia reperfusion (I/R) damage [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a short period of clamping of the portal triad is also used as a pre-conditioning method in order to protect the liver against ischemia damage when continuous clamping is performed [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>I/R damage of the liver as a consequence of IPM has been well studied, however little is known about the effects of IPM on the gut. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament causes stasis in the portal vein and the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, thereby reducing splanchnic outflow [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Intestinal hypoperfusion leads to enterocyte damage and gut barrier loss [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The effect of splanchnic hypoperfusion on intestinal damage as a consequence of IPM has been proven in several animal studies [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Sheen-Chen et al. [12] showed recently in rats that occlusion of the hepatoduodenal ligament significantly increased jejunal apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, data on the effect of IPM on the gut in man are scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Loss of intestinal epithelial integrity is clinically important, as it is associated with the development of sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF) following major surgery, trauma and shock [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This might be especially important in patients with small for size liver remnant volume and/or parenchymal dysfunction due to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, cholestasis and/or cirrhosis [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a small, water-soluble cytosolic protein that is easily released into the circulation upon enterocyte membrane integrity loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>I-FABP is solely present in mature epithelial cells of the small intestine and to a lesser extent in the large intestine [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We [8], [19] and others [18], [20], [21] have shown that I-FABP is an accurate marker for intestinal epithelial cell damage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The principal aim of this study was to investigate whether IPM causes intestinal epithelial cell damage and barrier loss in patients undergoing liver resection. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate whether IPM causes loss of intestinal epithelial cell integrity and leads to endotoxemia in patients undergoing liver resection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study show that the use of total IPM is associated with intestinal epithelial cell damage and subsequent endotoxemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In the total-IPM group (15 min and 30 min total IPM combined), plasma I-FABP levels were significantly increased 8 hours after start of surgery compared to baseline, while in the no-IPM group and sel-IPM group no significant differences in I-FABP levels were observed between different time points. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>By measuring concentration differences across the gut and the hepatosplanchnic area, we were able to show that there was a net I-FABP release from the hepatosplanchnic area in the total-IPM group, explaining the high levels of I-FABP in this group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the total-IPM group IgG EndoCAb decreased significantly on POD1 compared to baseline while this effect was not observed in the no-IPM and sel-IPM group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Consumption of IgG EndoCAb in the total IPM group suggests that total IPM resulted in translocation of gut derived endotoxins, possibly by intestinal barrier dysfunction due to epithelial cell damage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study are in line with several animal studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Ochiai et al. [9] showed that IPM caused intestinal epithelial cell damage and increased small intestinal permeability in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In two other rat studies, increased bacterial translocation [10] and endotoxemia [10], [11] were demonstrated after IPM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Data on the effect of IPM on the gut in man are scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether it is only the impaired microcirculation in the intestine during portal clamping which causes cell damage or that the temporal acute rise of venous pressure in the mesenteric system in itself also plays a role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>King et al. [26] showed that when splanchnic venous outflow was occluded in patients, both intestinal oxygen extraction ratio and portal venous lactate increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>An acute rise of venous pressure in the microcirculation in itself will probably also impair perfusion and consequently cause tissue hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It is most likely a combination of the two mechanisms that explains the high levels of I-FABP in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>It would be worthwhile to study the microcirculation in vivo during the total IPM in order to further explore the pathophysiological mechanism behind the intestinal cell damage in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In this context Ferri et al. [27] showed that bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes occurred during liver resection in patients under continuous inflow occlusion, but there was no correlation between positive lymph nodes and post-operative infectious complications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing liver resection are more susceptible to development of a systemic inflammatory response due to endotoxemia, as hepatic endotoxin clearance is compromised due to a reduction of Kuppfer cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This is caused by reduction of the functional hepatic liver mass and by ischemia reperfusion damage to the functional liver parenchyma when IPM is applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Translocation of intraluminal intestinal toxins as a consequence of intestinal epithelial cell damage due to total-IPM could further contribute to systemic endotoxemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>It may therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis in patients undergoing liver resection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In line with this, infective complications are reported to negatively affect both short- and long-term outcome after liver resection [29], [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>This might be especially important in patients with underlying liver disease and cholestasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In the latter, most often infected areas of non-optimally drained liver segments are present during surgery [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>To prove these assumptions it would be worthwhile to investigate in future studies whether there is a relation between infective complications and the application of the total-IPM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The present study sheds new light on the question whether performing IPM is favorable in patients undergoing liver surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Hepatectomies without IPM can be performed safely due to advances in liver surgery such as the development of modern hemostatic devices and improvements in anesthesiological management [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Acute major bleeding remains an indication for IPM, but current evidence shows no benefit for IPM on outcome after liver resection [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Therefore in the modern era of liver surgery systematic use of IPM has become more often a subject of debate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our data show that total-IPM is associated with intestinal epithelial cell damage and endotoxemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This could play a role in the pathophysiology of infective postoperative complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is clinically relevant that the role of gut integrity loss induced by ischemia/reperfusion of the liver during liver resections and liver transplantations is further investigated in future studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This pathophysiologic mechanism is probably underestimated in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Unravelling this mechanism could help to (preoperatively) identify patients with a higher risk of infective postoperative complications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>A possibly more safe approach than total IPM is selective IPM, which is performed by selectively excluding the right or left hemi liver from the circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Selectively clamping the right or left portal pedicle is safe and feasible for patients with normal liver parenchyma and especially in cirrhotic patients the selective IPM induces less ischemic liver injury compared to total IPM [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>One would expect that also the intestinal epithelial cell integrity is less compromised in these patients because splanchnic outflow is only partly reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was confirmed in the present study as no significant increase was observed in arterial I-FABP levels in 6 patients undergoing selective IPM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences on any time point between the sel-IPM group and the total-IPM group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to the relatively small group size (type II error), as only one patient showed a substantial increase in I-FABP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that the use of the total intermittent Pringle maneuver causes intestinal epithelial cell damage and endotoxemia during liver surgery in man. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>IPM can therefore potentially increase the risks of liver resections despite a possible reduction of intraoperative blood loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Intestinal epithelial cell damage and endotoxemia induced by IPM could negatively affect the patient's condition and post-operative recovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Whether gut damage as a consequence of the total-IPM is causally related to systemic inflammation remains to be established. </plain></SENT>
