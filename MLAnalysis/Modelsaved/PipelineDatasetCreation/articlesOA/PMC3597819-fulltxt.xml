Cul3-based Cullin-RING ligases are uniquely associated with BTB adaptors that incorporate homodimerization, Cul3 assembly, and substrate recognition into a single multidomain protein, of which the best known are BTB-BACK-Kelch domain proteins, including KEAP1. Cul3 assembly requires a BTB protein &#8220;3-box&#8221; motif, analogous to the F-box and SOCS box motifs of other Cullin-based E3s. To define the molecular basis for this assembly and the overall architecture of the E3, we determined the crystal structures of the BTB-BACK domains of KLHL11 both alone and in complex with Cul3, along with the Kelch domain structures of KLHL2 (Mayven), KLHL7, KLHL12, and KBTBD5. We show that Cul3 interaction is dependent on a unique N-terminal extension sequence that packs against the 3-box in a hydrophobic groove centrally located between the BTB and BACK domains. Deletion of this N-terminal region results in a 30-fold loss in affinity. The presented data offer a model for the quaternary assembly of this E3 class that supports the bivalent capture of Nrf2 and reveals potential new sites for E3 inhibitor design.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Proteasome</kwd><kwd>Protein-Protein Interactions</kwd><kwd>Signaling</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>X-ray Crystallography</kwd><kwd>&#946;-Propeller</kwd><kwd>Degradation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitylation proceeds through a cascade of enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme uses ATP to catalyze the covalent transfer of ubiquitin to the active site cysteine of an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. An E3 ubiquitin ligase further catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to a substrate lysine. Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> are the largest family of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases and adopt a modular assembly that facilitates the ubiquitylation of divergent substrates. The Cullin subunit (Cul1&#8211;5 or Cul7) forms a central stalk-like scaffold that orients and constrains the substrate binding and catalytic centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD) binds a specific substrate-recognition domain, usually through an adaptor protein, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) binds a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) protein (Rbx1 or Rbx2), which in turn recruits an E2-ubiquitin conjugate. Neddylation of the CTD is additionally required to induce conformational changes in the CRL that bring the substrate and E2-ubiquitin into juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The crystal structure of an entire CRL1 complex (also known as a SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ligase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) suggests that different CRLs confer different spacings to allow substrates of varying sizes to be ubiquitylated.</p><p>The CRL3 subclass utilizes Cul3, which combines exclusively with BTB-containing proteins as substrate-specific adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The BTB domain (<underline>B</underline>ric-a-brac, <underline>T</underline>ramtrack, and <underline>B</underline>road complex), first characterized by the crystal structure of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), shares a conserved fold with the Cul1 adaptor Skp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and the Cul2/5 adaptor ElonginC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Moreover, the structure of the SPOP BTB domain in complex with the Cul3<sub>NTD</sub> shows an assembly similar to the CRL1 complex of Skp1 and Cul1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, two features make the BTB adaptors unique among CRLs. First, the BTB adaptor domain dimerizes and is therefore capable of recruiting two Cul3 subunits into the CRL3 complex. Second, the BTB-containing proteins typically host a second protein-protein interaction domain, so that a single subunit functions as both adaptor and substrate-recognition module. The latter include the C-terminal Kelch, PHR (PAM, Highwire, and RPM-1), or zinc finger domains, whereas SPOP contains an N-terminal MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The most common substrate-recognition domain in the CRL3 subclass is the Kelch &#946;-propeller domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which occurs C-terminal to BTB and BACK (for <underline>B</underline>TB <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>C</underline>-terminal <underline>K</underline>elch&#8221;) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The best known example of a BTB-Kelch protein is KEAP1, which associates with Cul3 to regulate cellular levels of the transcription factor Nrf2, a master regulator of the anti-oxidant response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). KEAP1 demonstrates how important the dimeric CRL3 architecture is for substrate ubiquitylation as it requires two Kelch domains to engage two distinct epitopes in Nrf2 simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). KEAP1 mutations that disrupt Nrf2 ubiquitylation are associated with lung cancer progression and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Mutations in the BTB-Kelch proteins KLHL3, KLHL7, and KLHL9 are additionally associated with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and distal myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), respectively, although their corresponding substrates have yet to be identified. After KEAP1, the best characterized protein is KLHL12, which modulates COPII assembly for collagen export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and also ubiquitylates both the dopamine D4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and dishevelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Recent structures of SPOP-substrate complexes identify a two-helix extension of the BTB domain that is critical for high affinity Cul3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Defined as the &#8220;3-box,&#8221; this motif appears common to all BTB adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). To understand the molecular basis for this assembly and to establish structural models for the dimeric BTB-Kelch family, we determined the crystal structures of the BTB-BACK domains of KLHL11 both alone and in complex with Cul3, along with the structures of four representative Kelch domains. The presented data provide a structural model for the understanding of the specific assembly of the BTB-Kelch E3 adaptor proteins with Cul3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>Human KLHL11 (UniProt Q9NVR0, residues 67&#8211;340), KLHL2 (O95198, residues 294&#8211;593), KLHL7 (Q8IXQ5, residues 283&#8211;586), and KLHL12 (Q53G59, residues 268&#8211;567) were subcloned into the vector pNIC28-Bsa4.

Their nomenclature is varied, but the protein family can be subdivided into the Kelch-like (KLHL(1&#8211;39)) and the Kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing proteins (KBTBD(1&#8211;13)). To derive structural models for their function as Cul3-based E3 ligases, members of this family were subcloned and screened for bacterial expression. Soluble expression constructs were identified that contained the BTB-BACK or Kelch domains but not the BACK-Kelch or BTB-BACK-Kelch domains. Crystal structures of the BTB-BACK domains of human KLHL11 were subsequently solved alone and in complex with the N-terminal Cullin-repeat domain of Cul3.

In particular, the long C-terminal helices that support the substrate-binding WD40 (&#946;-TrCP1) or Kelch (KLHL11) domain show a 50&#176; change in orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>D</italic>). In part, this results from the distinct orientation of the 3-box, which packs perpendicular to the equivalent F-box or SOCS box motifs of other CRL substrate-recognition domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>). These changes likely reflect the distinct architecture of the CRL3 class imposed by the BTB dimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural Diversity of the Kelch Substrate-Recognition Domain</title><p>The Kelch domain is the most widespread of the CRL3 substrate-recognition domains and recruits a diverse range of substrates.

The six Kelch repeats form the six &#8220;blades&#8221; of the propeller, each consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel &#946;-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>), with a C-terminal &#946;A strand closing the propeller by completing blade I. This site shows divergence between the KLHL and KBTBD proteins. The Kelch-like (KLHL) proteins are characterized by consensus repeats, including a Gly-Gly pair that terminates strand &#946;B, and hydrophobic Tyr (&#946;C) and Trp (&#946;D) residues that pack between blades (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M112.437996/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). In contrast, KBTBD5 exhibits an atypical repeat resulting in a more twisted blade I structure, as observed previously for KBTBD10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Both KBTBD proteins also possess an extended C terminus that contributes a short &#946;E strand to blade I as well as the usual &#946;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Sequence comparisons suggest that this altered structure is a common feature of the KBTBD proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M112.437996/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p><p>The surface properties of the six structures are strikingly diverse, reflecting their limited sequence identity. The substrate-binding site, first identified in the KEAP1-Nrf2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), lies on the narrower upper face of the Kelch domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). This surface displays a distinct electrostatic potential in each structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). The shape and size of the substrate pocket is determined by the inter-blade DA loops as well as the variable BC loops, which protrude significantly out of the upper propeller face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). Interestingly, KBTBD5 and KBTBD10 display a rather atypical loop arrangement, with an unusually short BC loop (three residues) in blade I flanked by greatly extended loops (18 and 20 residues, respectively) in blades II and VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). By contrast, the BC loops in the KLHL structures are more evenly distributed, with an average loop length of 12 residues. These variant features are expected to contribute to the precise substrate specificity of each BTB-Kelch family member.</p></sec><sec><title>Cul3 Binding to the 3-Box Involves a Specific N-terminal Extension Sequence</title><p>Substrate ubiquitylation requires the BTB-Kelch proteins to assemble with Cul3.

In addition to the expected Cullin-repeat-BTB interaction, we define a novel interaction between the specific N-terminal extension sequence of Cul3 and the 3-box of KLHL11. Previously, the interaction of an N-terminal extension sequence was considered unique to Cul4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The surprise interaction of the Cul3 N-terminal region is facilitated by a proximal hydrophobic groove located at the interface of the BTB, 3-box, and BACK domains. Occupying this site enables the N-terminal extension to form contacts across all three KLHL11 domains and therefore to contribute significantly to the overall binding affinity. Notably, the bound Cullin-repeat is also enveloped by the BTB &#945;3-&#946;4 loop that refolds around the relatively short H2 helix like a molecular clamp. A similar BTB adaptor interface is found in the SPOP-Cul3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) suggesting that this is indeed a conserved mechanism of Cul3 interaction.</p><p>Upon assembly with Cul3, the BTB-Kelch proteins may direct dynamic control of ubiquitylation through the bivalent coordination of a single substrate molecule. A &#8220;fixed-ends&#8221; model is proposed for Nrf2 recruitment in which high (ETGE) and low (DLG) affinity recognition motifs are tethered to the two Kelch domains of a KEAP1 homodimer to promote ubiquitylation of a central lysine-rich &#945;-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The presented structures offer a molecular model to support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). The elongated BTB-BACK domains establish a spacer suitable for Nrf2 recruitment while orienting the associated Cullin-RING complexes to position the E2 molecules centrally for ubiquitin transfer. The architecture of the KEAP1 protein has also been determined by single particle electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Consistent with this study, the reconstruction at 24 &#8491; resolution revealed an elongated structure with a 2-fold symmetry axis. Two distinct globular domains were attached by short linker arms to a central stem. The crystal structures indicate that the linker likely corresponds to the 3-box that separates the BTB stem from the globular domains, each comprising a Kelch domain atop the BACK domain helices &#945;9&#8211;&#945;14. In the EM reconstruction, the positions of the two substrate-binding sites were somewhat flexible with an average separation of 80 &#8491; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Some 47 residues separate the ETGE and DLG motifs, giving a theoretic span of 98 &#8491;, assuming a 33-residue helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our structural model provides a span of 95 &#8491;, broadly consistent with the EM data.</p><p>Dimerization is also required for the E3 activity of some SCF complexes, including those of &#946;-TrCP1 and Cdc4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). In contrast to the BTB adaptors, these CRL1 complexes dimerize through the D domain of the substrate-recognition module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Their predicted assemblies also position the substrate centrally to two catalytic centers, although a distinct configuration is enforced due to the alternative mode of dimerization. In addition to robust substrate capture, dimeric E3s may confer greater spatial variability to enable efficient ubiquitylation of diverse substrate lysine acceptor sites. E3 interaction is also thought to bias dynamic E2-ubiquitin ensembles toward a conformation with enhanced reactivity for substrate lysines. In some E3 classes, this reaction is catalyzed by dimerization of the RING domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), although it remains unclear how this mechanism could be utilized by the CRL families. Given the relative positions of the Rbx1 subunits in the structural model, such a mechanism would likely require higher order CRL3 assembly, as suggested for the MATH-BTB protein SPOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Uniquely, the BTB-Kelch family proteins integrate the functions of both CRL adaptors and substrate receptors. Cul3 must therefore assemble with a large number of distinct BTB adaptor domains, whereas other Cullins bind a common adaptor protein such as Skp1 or ElonginC. As a consequence, BTB E3 ligases may offer a greater diversity of drug-targeting sites for investigation. In this respect, several sites in the KLHL11 structure are of interest, including the BTB-dimer interface, the Cullin-repeat interface, and the hydrophobic groove of the 3-box. Indeed, disruption of Cul3 N-terminal interactions with the hydrophobic groove resulted in a 30-fold loss in affinity. A similar decrease was observed upon deletion of the 3-box in SPOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Promisingly, small molecules have been identified previously that target the corepressor binding groove of the BCL6 BTB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) as well as the substrate binding grooves of E3 ligases, including MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), VHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), and Skp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>).</p><p>The presented structures reveal the novel architecture of BTB-Cul3 assembly and impact our mechanistic understanding of CRL3 activity with potential therapeutic implications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>The Structural Genomics Consortium is a registered charity (number 1097737) that receives funds from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Genome Canada, GlaxoSmithKline, Lilly Canada, the Novartis Research Foundation, Pfizer, Takeda, AbbVie, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation, and Wellcome Trust Grant 092809/Z/10/Z.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material" id="FN2"><label><inline-graphic xlink:href="sbox.jpg"/></label><p>This article contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M112.437996/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, Table S1, and an additional reference</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2VPJ">2VPJ</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2XN4">2XN4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3II7">3II7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3I3N">3I3N</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4APF">4APF</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4AP2">4AP2</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4ASC">4ASC</ext-link>) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wwpdb.org/">http://wwpdb.org/</ext-link>).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN4"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are:
