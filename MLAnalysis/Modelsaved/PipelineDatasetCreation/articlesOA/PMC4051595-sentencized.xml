<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcriptional complex yet its role in prostate cancer progression and the relationship between AR and FOXA1 are not completely resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is well established that FOXA1 levels are elevated in advanced prostate cancer and metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We mimicked these conditions by over-expressing FOXA1 in the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and observed a significant increase in AR genomic binding at novel regions that possess increased chromatin accessibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High levels of FOXA1 resulted in increased proliferation at both sub-optimal and high 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for FOXA1 in a clinical prostate cancer cohort revealed that high FOXA1 expression is associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.2-21.1, p=0.028), positive surgical margins and higher stage disease at diagnosis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The standard first line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which typically induces regression of the tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite a high initial response rate in nearly all cases, resistance to ADT occurs resulting in tumor regrowth which is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tumors that become resistant to ADT pose a significant clinical challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The development of new hormonal therapies that target androgen biosynthesis (e.g. Abiraterone) or the androgen receptor directly (e.g. Enzalutamide) has produced improved outcomes for patients with CRPC, but they are not universally effective and responses are not durable (3, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The androgen receptor (AR) remains active and critical for tumor growth in CRPC despite low circulating levels of androgens, but typically there are alterations in the receptor structure or function that allow it to retain activity despite ADT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Documented methods for circumvention of ADT include AR gene amplification, acquisition of mutations, genomic rearrangements and alternative splicing of AR (2, 5-8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An additional mechanism is altered interaction of AR with key transcriptional cofactors (9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The forkhead transcription factor FOXA1 is a key member of the AR transcriptional complex, which has been shown to interact directly with AR through the hinge domain (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>FOXA1 functions primarily as a pioneer factor, binding to closed chromatin regions through its winged helix domain, which has a structure akin to that of linker histones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>FOXA1 association with chromatin contributes to changes in chromatin accessibility, rendering these regions more accessible to nuclear receptors such as AR (11), ER (12) and PR (13) . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>As such, FOXA1 plays a key role in demarcating the tissue specific binding sites of these nuclear receptors (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>FOXA1, expressed in the peripheral zone of the human prostate (15), is essential for hormone induced ductal branching and epithelial cell maturation of the prostate gland during puberty (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FOXA1 plays a central role in AR driven gene expression in both the normal prostate and prostate cancers (11, 17, 18). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There are a number of conflicting reports regarding the role that FOXA1 plays in the progression of prostate cancer to castrate resistant disease and its expression has been associated with both good and poor prostate cancer patient outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>One study suggested that FOXA1 mRNA levels are moderately up-regulated in primary cancer when compared to benign disease, but unexpectedly it was down-regulated in metastasis (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this observation, a number of immunohistochemical studies have shown that FOXA1 is a marker of poor outcome in prostate cancer, with high FOXA1 levels being associated with a shorter time to biochemical recurrence (15, 20) or prostate cancer-specific death (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>High expression at the protein level has also been noted in the majority (82-89%) of metastatic and CRPC samples (15, 22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, it remains to be determined what the exact consequences of higher FOXA1 levels are for prostate cancer progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Examination of AR binding events in CRPC cell line models and primary tissues suggests that the unique CRPC AR sites are not reliant upon FOXA1 (23, 24) and similarly, FOXA1 may have AR independent functions in CRPC (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Despite this, FOXA1 over-expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells exhibit increased migration and produce larger tumors in xenograft models (15, 26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus it is imperative to assess the consequences of elevated FOXA1 expression and the potential impact on AR signalling during prostate cancer progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the downstream effects of elevated FOXA1 levels on AR chromatin binding, gene expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We found that in cells expressing higher levels of FOXA1, AR makes novel chromatin associations and is able to drive tumor cell growth even at reduced levels of androgen, suggesting that tumors with higher FOXA1 levels may have a growth advantage following androgen deprivation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Given the disputed role that elevated levels of FOXA1 play in prostate cancer, we aimed to examine the effects of over-expression of FOXA1 in prostate cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was transiently transfected with a control vector or a FOXA1 construct, which we subsequently termed ‘FOXA1 high’ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed increased FOXA1 levels compared to GFP control transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Since AR is central to both primary and castrate resistant prostate cancer, we initially focused on the effect of increased levels of FOXA1 upon AR binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Genome wide AR binding regions were mapped in asynchronous ‘FOXA1 high’ versus GFP control cells and we found an almost two-fold increase in reproducible AR binding sites (ARBS) in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells (33,953 ARBS in control cells versus 57,155 ARBS in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells, Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The majority (86%) of the ARBS in control cells were also seen in FOXA1 high cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, in elevated FOXA1 conditions, an additional 28,100 ARBS were observed (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In general, there was a significant increase in AR peak strength across all sites in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells compared to control (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Shared regions identified in both control and FOXA1 over-expressing cells have a significantly higher mean read count at the AR peak summit in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells (8.34 reads) compared to control (6.03 reads; Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there are a large number of sites (28,100) where an ARBS was only detected in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells, termed ‘gained’ sites (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the new AR binding sites that occur in the presence of elevated FOXA1 are regions that have some weak binding in control cells, implying an amplification of AR-DNA binding at suboptimal binding domains (mean read count 2.76 in ‘FOXA1 high’ versus 1.56 in Control cells; Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Overall our data suggests a general amplification of AR binding in the presence of higher FOXA1 levels as illustrated by a heatmap of the shared and gained ARBS (Figure 1D) and an example genomic region (Figure 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was confirmed in another AR driven cancer cell line model, the ERα-AR+ MDA-MB-453 cell line, which is used as a model of molecular apocrine breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>AR ChIP-seq in ‘FOXA1 high’ MDA-MB-453 cells also showed greater AR binding intensity than in control cells (Supplementary Figure 2A&amp;B and Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Two recently published studies reported reprogramming of AR to de novo regions in the genome following loss of FOXA1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells (10, 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We performed hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the sites of AR occupancy in our GFP control and ‘FOXA1 high’ LNCaP cells with those in the siControl and siFOXA1 treated LNCaP cells from the published studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>By directly comparing the changes that occur in AR binding in conditions where FOXA1 is both absent and over-expressed, we see that the ARBS determined in the siFOXA1 treatment group cluster separately from those in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the novel ARBS seen in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells are not the same locations as the de novo AR binding seen after loss of FOXA1 (Supplementary Figure 1B &amp; C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Increase in AR Occupancy after FOXA1 over-expression is likely due to increased chromatin accessibility </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In order to infer the mechanism behind the increased AR binding seen after FOXA1 over-expression, we assessed whether there was a global increase in AR protein levels, but we did not detect an appreciable change in AR levels following FOXA1 over-expression (Supplementary Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Therefore to identify alternate factors that may be redirecting AR to the chromatin, we conducted de novo motif analysis on the unique ARBS associated with FOXA1 over-expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We found significant enrichment for motifs representing STAT3, SP1 and the ETS (ELF5) transcription factors (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We also detected a strong enrichment for forkhead motifs suggesting a large majority of the new ARBS may be directed by FOXA1 itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Comparison of our data with previously published LNCaP FOXA1 ChIP-seq data (27) revealed that FOXA1 is present at a large number (37%) of the gained ARBS sites (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Therefore over-expression of FOXA1 may directly mediate AR binding to ‘FOXA1 high’ gained regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This is supported by the visible but relatively weak FOXA1 binding at these gained AR binding regions, which one could postulate is increased upon FOXA1 over-expression (Supplementary Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In an effort to identify additional regulatory mechanisms that impinge on the AR-FOXA1 complex, we performed RIME (Rapid IMmunoprecipitation of Endogenous proteins) proteomic analysis (28) of each transcription factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Three independent replicates of AR and two independent replicates of FOXA1 RIME were conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Proteins must have been detected in at least two replicates, but in none of the matched IgG control immunoprecipitations to be considered an interacting protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This led to the identification of 139 AR and 236 FOXA1 interacting proteins (Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In total, 56 proteins interact with both AR and FOXA1 in our data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis of these common interacting partners revealed a highly significant enrichment for proteins involved in chromatin remodelling, in particular for the locus control region (LCR)-associated remodelling complex, LARC (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>LARC is a complex that controls accessibility of regulatory DNA sequences situated many kilobases away from their cognate promoters (29) that AR and FOXA1 co-occupy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>A number of these proteins have been validated in other studies to interact with AR (30-33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>FOXA1’s intrinsic pioneer factor function coupled with its interaction with a large number of histone modifying enzymes suggests that increased binding of AR under FOXA1 high conditions may occur because of enhanced chromatin accessibility at these regions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The effect of high levels of FOXA1 on prostate cancer proliferation was assessed in AR+ LNCaP prostate cancer cells and our second AR-driven cancer model, the MDA-MB-453 molecular apocrine breast cancer cell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed FOXA1 over-expression in MDA-MB-453 cells with no alteration in AR protein levels (Supplementary Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of both cell lines was assessed following treatment with either high (100nM DHT) or low (0.5nM DHT) androgen concentrations, the latter to mimic androgen depleted conditions observed following ADT. ‘FOXA1 high’ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of proliferation than GFP control transfected cells at both DHT concentrations (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a similar effect of FOXA1 over-expression was observed in the MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells following treatment with high and low doses of androgen (Figure 3B), suggesting that higher expression of FOXA1 enhances the growth promoting effects of AR in a ubiquitous, non-tissue specific manner in AR-driven cancers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To address some of the conflicting data regarding the prognostic value of FOXA1 expression in prostate cancer, we undertook an immunohistochemical analysis of FOXA1 in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 102 prostate cancer cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Our study with a median follow up time of 86 months after radical prostatectomy (range 3 to 151 months) has longer follow up than other published studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Examples of FOXA1 immunostaining in prostate cancer are shown in Figure 4 A-F. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We found FOXA1 expression to be significantly higher in tumors compared to matched benign and normal prostate tissues (median H-score cancer = 69.44 versus benign = 0, p value &lt;0.0001, Supplementary Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In evaluating the association between FOXA1 H-score and biochemical recurrence, we divided patients into two groups based on the first quartile given that this cut-point showed the most significant difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly higher risk of biochemical recurrence for patients with high FOXA1 staining (H-score &gt;4.0, second through fourth quartile) compared to those with no or low FOXA1 staining, H-score ≤4.0 (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.2-21.1, p=0.028, Figure 4G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In particular, we noted a marked difference in the ten year biochemical recurrence free survival rate; 94.1% (95% CI 83.6%-100%) for patients with low FOXA1 staining compared to 53.6% (95% CI 42.2%-68.0%) for those with high FOXA1 staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>As detailed in Table 1, high FOXA1 staining also significantly correlated with higher pathological stage (p &lt;0.0001) and positive surgical margins (p = 0.021), which are markers of poor disease outcome (Supplementary Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant evidence of an association with Gleason Score (p = 0.25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we assessed whether FOXA1 predicted outcome independently of other known prostate cancer markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>We observed a greater than three-fold increased risk of biochemical recurrence in patients with high FOXA1 staining compared to those with low staining when adjusting individually for pathological stage (HR: 3.60, p=0.084, n=79) Gleason Score (HR: 3.02, p=0.13, n=74) and PSA (HR: 4.58, p=0.039, n=76), although this was not always significant in these smaller samples with missing clinicopathologic data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Using six biological replicates, we found 124 differentially regulated genes (DEG) with an FDR &lt;0.05; this included 51 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated genes in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells (Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The majority of these genes have an ARBS within 25kb of their start site in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells (93/124 DEG, 75%) implying that AR may be directly regulating expression of these differential genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>However, these genes are not typically regulated in vitro by DHT in the context of normal endogenous levels of FOXA1, with only 5.6% of the differentially expressed genes in ‘FOXA1 high’ cells considered to be androgen-regulated in an independent dataset of DHT-treated LNCaP cells (34). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis of the ‘FOXA1 high’ differentially expressed genes (Figure 5B) revealed a number of networks focused on signalling pathways known to be perturbed in prostate cancer (PTEN null, polycomb targets and TNC targets which signal through WNT) as well as differentiation pathways (Trogatizalone targets, poorly differentiated carcinoma and mature luminal cell program). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Due to the high expression of FOXA1 in CRPC and metastases (15, 22), we used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to correlate the CRPC gene program identified by Sharma et al (24) from primary CRPC tissue with the data from our ‘FOXA1 high’ microarray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>There was a significant enrichment of the CRPC gene set in our data set (p value 0.018, normalized enrichment score 1.14, Figure 5C) implying that FOXA1 may be in part responsible for the expression of a number of the genes expressed in CRPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In support of this concept, others have shown that silencing of FOXA1 in LNCaP-abl cells (one model of CRPC) has both AR-dependent and –independent effects on cell proliferation (25), and that loss of FOXA1 inhibits ligand-dependent AR chromatin binding in C4-2B cells (another LNCaP-derived model of CRPC (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Importantly we found that silencing of FOXA1 in C4-2B cells markedly inhibited their proliferative capacity (Supplementary Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that high levels of FOXA1 can drive a gene expression program that is similar to that seen in patients who develop castrate resistant disease, implying a central role for FOXA1 in the development of CRPC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In addition to enhancement of AR binding to traditional AR regulatory elements with overexpression of FOXA1, there was a significant increase in AR binding at 28,100 ARBS that exhibited weak binding under endogenous levels of FOXA1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated FOXA1 levels, which are characteristic of CRPC, facilitate AR binding to secondary sites where AR typically binds with low affinity and is not transcriptionally active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the gained AR sites observed under elevated FOXA1 conditions contain both canonical forkhead and ARE motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>When FOXA1 levels are increased, FOXA1 binds to these regions, making them more accessible in a greater proportion of the cells, resulting in an overall increase in AR binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that in the opposite condition, where FOXA1 is lost, AR is also reprogrammed (10, 21), but the novel AR binding sites that occur in the absence of FOXA1 are not the same as those that arise with over-expression of FOXA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The simplest hypothesis for this difference is that in the absence of FOXA1, alternative transcription factors mediate AR binding to chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In the presence of FOXA1, relative levels of this pioneer factor appear to be the rate-limiting determinant of AR chromatin binding in prostate cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Under conditions where FOXA1 is abnormally elevated, AR gains the capacity for enhanced chromatin binding at non-classical sites, as observed in CRPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, these alterations in AR and FOXA1 binding elicit a gene expression program that is reminiscent of that seen in CRPC primary tissues, which also exhibit high FOXA1 expression (15, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Resistance to ADT and progression to CRPC involves a diverse range of adaptive mechanisms to enhance AR signaling (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Herein we provide evidence that one such mechanism could be via up-regulation of FOXA1, resulting in an expanded AR chromatin binding landscape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Tumors with high FOXA1 levels may have greater intrinsic AR activity and therefore are better adapted to survive at low levels of androgen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The increased proliferation that ‘FOXA1 high’ cells exhibited with low androgen concentrations in our study supports this theory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Further in vivo investigation of the effect of increased FOXA1 levels on tumor growth is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>To date, two reports have been published investigating the effects of high FOXA1 levels on tumor growth, but the conclusions were inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The first of these studies concluded that elevated FOXA1 inhibit prostate cancer metastasis in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>However, in that study, the AR negative PC3-M cell line, which is not representative of the vast majority of prostate tumors, including CRPC, was used as the experimental model, Another xenograft study that examined the consequence of FOXA1 over-expression in AR+ LNCaP cells found a significant increase in tumor size compared to parental control cell xenografts (26), consistent with the results of the current study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>FOXA1 has been implicated as a marker of poor outcome in a number of tumor types, including lung (35), thyroid (36) esophageal (37) and malignant glioma (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Our data supports the growing bank of evidence suggesting that FOXA1 is a marker of poor outcome in prostate cancer patients, where high expression levels correlate with a shorter time to biochemical relapse (15, 20, 22, 39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, high FOXA1 expression robustly correlates with higher pathological stage, higher Gleason Score and AR expression (15, 20, 21), implying a central role for FOXA1 in the progression of prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high FOXA1 mRNA levels correlate with better patient outcome measures, such as a longer time to biochemical recurrence (19, 40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>A study of the concordance between changes seen by mRNA microarray analysis and of high-throughput proteomic profiling of primary prostate cancer tissue showed only a 48% - 61% agreement (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Given the role of FOXA1 as a transcription factor that modulates chromatin accessibility and binding of other proteins, it is prudent to consider the correlations that occur with protein levels rather than mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The exact role that FOXA1 plays in CRPC is still unclear, but interestingly it was recently observed that FOXA1 is mutated in 3-5% of prostate cancers, suggesting that altered FOXA1 function may be a feature of CRPC (26, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Some in vitro data suggest that FOXA1 may not play an important part of the AR transcriptional complex in CRPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Unique castration-resistant ARBS detected in the C4-2B cell line (23) do not significantly overlap with FOXA1 binding sites or contain the Forkhead motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>However, our results show that ablating FOXA1 in the C4-2B cell line robustly diminishes cell growth, indicating a persistent role for FOXA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our gene expression data for FOXA1 over-expressing LNCaP cells correlated well with a published CRPC gene signature (24), indicating that FOXA1 may be an important player in the switch to a more aggressive gene expression profile like that seen in CRPC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Thus, it will be critical to map AR and FOXA1 binding in matched primary and CRPC tissues in order to definitively assess the role of FOXA1 in prostate cancer progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>In summary, FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcription factor complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>High levels of FOXA1 result in increased AR binding, a transcription profile akin to CRPC and proliferation in the presence of low levels of androgenic hormones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a pivotal role for FOXA1 in the progression of prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
