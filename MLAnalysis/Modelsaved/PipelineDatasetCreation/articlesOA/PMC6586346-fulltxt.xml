Despite being declared an international emergency by the World Health Organization, very little is known about the mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis or the long-term consequences of maternal ZIKV infection in the affected offspring, largely due to the lack of appropriate rodent models. To address this issue, our lab has developed a working model of prenatal ZIKV infection in rats. In this study, we infected immune competent pregnant female rats with 10<sup>5</sup>&#8211;10<sup>7</sup> PFU of ZIKV (PRVABC59, Puerto Rico/Human/Dec 2015) in order to examine its pathogenesis in the dams and pups. We examined the febrile response and sickness behavior in the dams, in addition to neonatal mortality, microglia morphology, cortical organization, apoptosis, and brain region-specific volumes in the offspring. Here, we demonstrate that pregnant and non-pregnant female rats have a distinct febrile response to ZIKV infection. Moreover, prenatal ZIKV infection increased cell death and reduced tissue volume in the hippocampus and cortex in the neonatal offspring. For the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy and validity of an immunocompetent rat model for maternal ZIKV infection that results in significant brain malformations in the neonatal offspring.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Microscopy access was supported by grants from the NIH-NIGMS (P20 GM103446), the NSF (IIA-1301765) and the State of Delaware.

ZIKV remained primarily a primate pathogen for decades, sporadically infecting humans until 2007, when it caused its first noteworthy human epidemic on the Yap islands in Micronesia, and then in 2013 when it reached New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and more extensively, Brazil in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since then, active transmission of ZIKV has been reported in over 70 countries and territories globally (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html">http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html</ext-link>). ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of congenital malformations in the developing fetus, most notably, microcephaly. Through January 26th of 2016, 10,441 suspected and 2,366 confirmed ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases were reported in Brazil alone, prompting the World Health Organization to name ZIKV as a public health emergency of international concern [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Since its emergence, there has been a notable increase in research dedicated to understanding the pathogenicity of ZIKV in order to develop vaccines and therapeutic strategies. Despite these efforts, no effective therapies currently exist. This is partially due to limitations in current ZIKV animal models used for experimentation, which do not accurately mimic ZIKV infectivity in immunocompetent humans. The most widely used animal models for ZIKV infection utilize immunocompromised mice, and/or use atypical routes of infection such as: intracranial, intraperitoneal, and intravenous routes (see [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], for reviews). These models are necessary to examine ZIKV infection in a mouse because adult wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, Swiss Webster, BALB/c, and CD-1 mice are unable to sustain ZIKV infection following typical peripheral administration (subcutaneous, intra-peritoneal, and intravenous) [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Previous data from our lab demonstrate that rats are naturally immunocompromised during pregnancy, particularly during late gestation, a phenomenon that is also well-known in humans, resulting in altered immune responses and disease pathogenesis in pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a result, we hypothesized that pregnant rats may be naturally vulnerable to ZIKV infection, thus making them an ideal animal model for human maternal ZIKV infection. Here, we developed a rat model to study the effects of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, in order to examine its effects on the developing fetal brain.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we inoculated pregnant and non-pregnant female rats subcutaneously with three doses of ZIKV (ZIKV 1&#215;10<sup>5</sup>, 1&#215;10<sup>6</sup>, and 1&#215;10<sup>7</sup> PFU/dose) and assessed signs of infection in the females including body temperature, sickness behavior, changes in food and water consumption, as well as maternal and neonatal mortality. In Experiment 2, we assessed the impact of our highest dose of ZIKV (1&#215;10<sup>7</sup>) on neonatal brain volume, cortical organization, viral presence, and apoptosis, as well as microglial gene expression, number, and morphology. This is the first study of its kind to demonstrate that subcutaneous infection of ZIKV in an immune competent pregnant female rat results in vertical transmission to the fetus, neural cell death, and associated brain malformations in the offspring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and breeding</title><p>Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in same sex pairs in clear, polypropylene cages (45cm x 20.5cm x 24cm) with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. The colony room was maintained at 22&#176;C under a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. Sixty nulliparous females aged 54&#8211;56 days in age were paired individually with male rats of the same age for breeding to generate litters in various cohorts throughout the course of the experiments. The presence of a vaginal plug was checked daily in order to confirm pregnancy and the date of conception, embryonic day 0 (E0). Day of birth (DOB, approximately E23) was assigned as Postnatal day 0 (P0). Male breeders were removed from cages and females were moved to a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL 2) animal isolation facility and were individually housed in clean cages prior to infection of the pregnant females on E18.

Moreover, late gestation (E18-23) in rats is a time point during which significant brain growth occurs, similar to the second trimester equivalent in humans [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Rats were inoculated on E18 based on the presence of a sperm plug on E1; however, after the rats gave birth, we estimate that dams were inoculated between E17 and E19. These minor variations in the date of inoculation did not significantly impact the main effect of ZIKV infection on cell death or brain volumes that were measured in the affected offspring across the various litters (see Results Experiment 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experiment 1: Monitoring the symptoms of ZIKV infection in pregnant and non-pregnant female rats</title><p>Experiment 1 aimed to assess the symptoms of infection following various doses of ZIKV infection (1&#215;10<sup>5</sup>&#8211;10<sup>7</sup> PFU/dose). The febrile response, sickness behavior, food and water consumption, and pup mortality were monitored daily for 5&#8211;7 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all dams. Daily rat body temperature was measured each evening, between 18:00 and 20:00 hours using a rectal probe thermometer. Sickness behavior including shivering, curled up posture, and piloerection [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was also recorded at these time points.

The pups were euthanized by rapid decapitation. Based on the data obtained in Experiment 1, which suggested very few differences in the maternal response to infection across the various doses, Experiment 2 focused on comparing differences between the pup brains from offspring that had received the highest ZIKV dose (1&#215;10<sup>7</sup>) to our diluent control offspring. Two males and two females from each litter of these groups were selected for tissue collection, and thus multiple litters are represented across each treatment group. Pup brains were collected and immediately fixed in 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 hours at 4&#176;C.

MHCII is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, primarily on microglia, and is responsible for antigen recognition and the activation of the adaptive immune system.

Most notable of these is microcephaly, a neurological disorder characterized by a reduction in head circumference and brain cortical size [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that subcutaneous ZIKV injection of pregnant female rats is able to gain access to the fetal compartment and significantly impact the developing brain of the affected offspring, despite <italic>minimal</italic> symptoms in the dam. In particular, we demonstrate that maternal ZIKV inoculation results in increased cell death, reduced hippocampal and cortical volumes, and preliminary evidence of cereborcortical dysplasia in the neonatal brain. For the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy and validity of an immune competent rat model for maternal ZIKV infection that results in significant brain malformations in the affected offspring.</p><p>The majority of existing models for ZIKV infection have used immunosuppressed mice because adult mice can effectively mount an antiviral response that limits viremia [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, infection during pregnancy of female mice that lack type 1 interferon signaling produced a spectrum of congenital defects seen in some ZIKV-exposed infants [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but these models lack generalizability to the human condition. Other models employ direct intracranial injection in immunocompetent mice to study the impact of ZIKV on the developing brain [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While these models provide valuable insight to the full effects of the relatively &#8220;unchecked&#8221; virus given the absence of a maternal interferon response, they lack the translational component, which is essential for understanding the complete pathophysiology of ZIKV infectivity. A previous study from our lab found that rats have a naturally suppressed immune system during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], making them a plausible candidate for a translational model of prenatal ZIKV infection. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by injecting female rats subcutaneously, with the intent to mimic a mosquito bite&#8212;a common route of ZIKV infectivity in humans [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and found that non-pregnant female rats mounted a significant febrile response to ZIKV compared to diluent controls. Interestingly, this effect of ZIKV did not occur in the pregnant female rats. The absence of a febrile response in the pregnant female rats suggests that the immune system of the pregnant dam does not <italic>fully</italic> respond to the viral infection (via pro-inflammatory cytokines, for instance), and thus further supports the notion of an immunosuppressed state during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is important to note that ZIKV infection did not have an impact on overt sickness behavior or changes in food and water consumption in either group, suggesting that the ZIKV infected dams were not severely impacted by the virus, an effect that is similar to the symptoms described in ZIKV-infected humans [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and furthermore, rules out any potential influence of maternal malnourishment on our observed pup outcomes.</p><p>Our results also demonstrate that pups born to ZIKV-inoculated mothers exhibited an increase in cell death in the hippocampus and cortex, a reduction in hippocampal and cortical volumes, and preliminary evidence of cerebrocortical dysplasia. The ability for a maternal ZIKV inoculation to produce these brain malformations and associated neural cell death in the affected pups suggests that the virus is not cleared by the maternal immune system, and was able disrupt normal brain development in the fetus.</p><p>The exact mechanism(s) by which the virus is able to cause this neurological disorder in our model remains unclear. In particular, the effects of ZIKV inoculation may be due to direct viral action in the developing brain via vertical transmission [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], or via an indirect, secondary mechanism such as maternal immune activation or cytokine production. Both ideas are plausible, but require further investigation. Maternal immune activation itself can produce aberrant neural development and behaviors in various animal models [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; thus future experiments should investigate (1) the specific (if limited) immune response that pregnant female rats have to ZIKV inoculation, (2) how this response compares to the immune response produced in a non-pregnant females, and (3) which cytokines may be responsible for affecting neural development in the offspring. The results of these proposed future studies, which build directly from our findings here, would significantly inform our greater understanding of the mechanisms by which infection during pregnancy with viruses such as ZIKV, rubella, and cytomegalovirus can produce significant neurological effects in the offspring [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain that express pattern recognition receptors dedicated to identifying and responding to viruses [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As a result, there are a number of studies that have examined microglia as a target of ZIKV and how microglia respond to ZIKV infection of other surrounding neural cells [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These animal models (i.e. mouse and human) have used immunohistochemistry to measure the impact of ZIKV exposure on microglia, they found that (1) microglia are able to be infected by ZIKV [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], (2) they can be activated following ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and (3) they exhibit altered coordination and organization following exposure to ZIKV (including microglial hyperplasia, perivascular cuffing etc.) [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, we saw no change in total microglial number or microglial morphology between treatment groups, however subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with microglial activation. Taken together, this suggests that microglial morphology may not be indicative in their function in this scenario, and that microglia are responsive to the viral challenge 7 days post inoculation. Thus, future studies could examine various, earlier time points post inoculation to fully understand the time course and the role of microglial cells in their response to maternal ZIKV during the early course of the infection.</p><p>In contrast to other brain regions examined, we found no detectable increase in apoptosis in the dentate gyrus of the offspring&#8217;s hippocampus, though we found a significant <italic>decrease</italic> in volume and a trending decrease in the number of microglia in this brain region because of maternal ZIKV infection. These data suggest that the dentate gyrus of the developing hippocampus may have a unique response to the viral infection relative to other regions in the developing brain. The dentate gyrus is one of only a few brain regions known for on-going neurogenesis throughout the lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; thus, it is possible that this unique neural niche is differentially affected by the prenatal ZIKV infection compared to other sub-regions of the hippocampus and the cortex, an idea that has been posited in other models of immune activation [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>It is now clear that ZIKV-induced congenital abnormalities extend well beyond microcephaly [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our preliminary evidence of cerebrocortical dysplasia suggests that one or more steps involved in corticogenesis has been disrupted. Evidence in other ZIKV-infection models suggests that ZIKV preferentially infects neural progenitor cells [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which are responsible for cellular differentiation, neuronal migration, and maturation of cortical structures in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0218539.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible ZIKV may target neural progenitor cells or their function in our rat model and thus explain the dysplasia of cortical neurons observed here.</p><p>These important experiments provide the first indication that a rat model of maternal ZIKV infection is an effective model for the studying the effects of ZIKV infection on fetal brain development. Future experiments should examine the full translational capability of this model, and the mechanisms by which prenatal ZIKV infection disrupts brain development. We are confident that our rat model will be effective for studying the negative long-term consequences and outcomes of ZIKV infection on affected offspring with the goal of developing preventative or therapeutic measures for its devastating effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests.
