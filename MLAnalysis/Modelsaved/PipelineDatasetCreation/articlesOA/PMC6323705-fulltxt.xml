Included among these hypertensive diseases affecting pregnant women is preeclampsia, a severe and diverse disorder that is associated with life-threatening multi-organ maternal complications and which causes serious feto-placental problems. It accounted for 22.5% of hypertensive patient admissions at the hospital where this study was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. Multiple interrelated pathways have been suggested to contribute to its pathogenesis. Previous studies have tested genes with potential biological relevance in specific pathways to ascertain whether certain variants influence the disease process. The biological pathways impacted by preeclampsia include but are not limited to aberrant placental development and dysfunctional hemodynamic and renal functions, impaired immune function, free radical dysregulation and lipid peroxidation, and defects in coagulation and fibrinolysis. We have previously found variants of the <italic>VEGF-A</italic> and <italic>VEGFR1</italic> genes to associate with preeclampsia among Filipinos, an ethnically distinct group with high prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These genes are important in angiogenesis, a critical process in the establishment of normal pregnancy and in preeclampsia.</p><p id="Par30">The effect of single gene variation will likely be contingent on other genetic variations (gene-gene interaction, or epistasis) and environmental factors (gene-environment interaction). Since many genes and environmental factors interact to cause multifactor and polygenic diseases, including preeclampsia, the effect of any single gene may be too small to be detected using traditional statistical methods, which do not take these interactions into account<bold>.</bold> The multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) algorithm has been designed as an alternative to traditional statistical methods to deal with high-order gene/factor interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. MDR has many other advantages over traditional methods. It is model-free, i.e., it does not assume any particular genetic model, and requires only a small sample size that can be used for case-control studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]<bold>.</bold> MDR has been successfully applied in detecting gene-gene interactions for a number of clinical phenotypes, which include bronchial asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In this study, we evaluated the role of contextual effects in the development of preeclampsia among Filipino women by analyzing 29 previously reported susceptibility SNPs found in 21 genes.

Only one model that included a genetic variant, as well as the significant demographic and clinical variables, was statistically significant; it included maternal age as three categories (18&#8211;25; 26&#8211;35; 36-Older); maternal BMI as three categories (13&#8211;17.97; 18&#8211;25; 25.1-Above) and rs1014064 (cross validation testing prediction&#8201;=&#8201;60.95%; permutation <italic>P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.005 and cross validation consistency&#8201;=&#8201;7/10) (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

In low BMI ranges (13&#8211;17.97), the outcome was dominated by a protective effect and in high BMI ranges (25.1-above) by a risk-increasing effect of body mass.

The MDR algorithm is a well-known data mining strategy that provides an improved representation of the genotypic and phenotypic data and enables better detection of higher-order interactions, such as epistatic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the current study, MDR identified a four-locus model that underscores a possible interaction among rs1014064 (<italic>ACVR2A</italic>), rs7664413 (<italic>VEGF-C</italic>), rs2549782 (<italic>ERAP2</italic>), and rs662 (<italic>PON1</italic>) variants when un-adjusted for age or BMI (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). However, when age and BMI were adjusted for, these effects disappeared. A significant interaction was found in a model involving the genetic variant rs1014064 (<italic>ACVR2A</italic>) and the demographic and clinical variables, age and BMI.</p><p id="Par46">The significant gene identified, <italic>ACVR2A</italic>, encodes the receptor for Activin A. ACVR2A expression in the placenta throughout pregnancy indicates its possible role in the regulation of placental development and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Initial studies have shown a linkage between preeclampsia and various parts of chromosome 2, where the <italic>ACVR2A</italic> gene is localized. The first reported locus for preeclampsia that met the criteria for genome-wide association significance was seen in chromosome 2p13 and 2q23 in a study involving Icelandic families, representing 343 affected women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Two other genome-wide association studies identified other loci in chromosome 2 distinct from those seen in the initial study, i.e., 2p25 in 15 families with 49 affected women from Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and 2p11&#8211;12 and 2q22 involving 34 families, representing 121 affected women from Australia and New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. With the reported significant linkage to chromosome 2q22, the same group identified the <italic>ACVR2A</italic> gene as a strong positional candidate gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">The MDR analysis identified the <italic>ACVR2A</italic> rs1014064, an intronic variant (A to G), as the only significant variant. This variant associated with preeclampsia in a large Norwegian population-based study (the HUNT study), together with the other <italic>ACVR2A</italic> variant (rs2161983) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which was also evaluated and found not associated with preeclampsia in this study, and with early onset preeclampsia in a Brazilian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">MDR has been used to identify the important role of epistasis in polygenic disorders, such as sporadic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and essential hypertension. A two-locus model including <italic>ACE</italic> and <italic>GRK4</italic> successfully predicted the blood pressure phenotype 70.5% of the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]<bold>.</bold> A genetic model based on the three common <italic>GRK4</italic> SNPs was 94.4% predictive of salt-sensitive hypertension, while a single-locus model with only the <italic>GRK4</italic> A142V variant was 78.4% predictive. By contrast, for low-renin hypertension, a two-locus model that includes the <italic>GRK4</italic> A142V variant and cytochrome P450 11B2 (<italic>CYP11B2</italic>) C-344&#8201;T was 77.8% predictive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These results reflect the differences in the underlying genetics and the crucial role of epistasis in the development of the different hypertension-related phenotypes. Considering the spectrum of the clinical presentation of preeclampsia, it is conceivable that different phenotypes of the disease may involve specific gene polymorphisms, i.e., locus heterogeniety. In fact, the presence of severe forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome and eclampsia, have been suggested to have their own set of predisposing gene variants. It is therefore important to know which specific genes contribute the most to their development.</p><p id="Par49">We also used ViSEN software, which provides a global interaction map to identify and corroborate risk-associated SNPs, visualize putative gene interactions and generate an interaction or concept map for preeclampsia. Similar to what we observed using MDR, we detected no statistically significant two- and three-way epistatic interactions with ViSEN. Due to its limitation to analyze only up to three-way epistasis, the four-locus model that we observed with MDR was undetected. Moreover, ViSEN as a statistical tool has its own limitations, e.g., the statistical epistasis quantifications in ViSEN only consider discrete traits and cannot incorporate measures on continuous traits like age and BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">In the analysis of genetic datasets, an important consideration is the power of analytical methods to identify accurate predictive models of disease. The MDR approach overcomes the common setbacks found in other methods. It is non-parametric, model-free, and can identify high-order gene-gene interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It retains its power to analyze in the presence of genotyping error and missing data (up to 5%). However, it has its own limitations, including a decrease in power in the presence of phenocopies and genetic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">With respect to marginal effects, one of the SNPs we genotyped in VEGF-A, rs3025039, that was previously identified as associating with preeclampsia in the Philippines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] also showed a marginal association in our data set when adjusting for covariates (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.022). Although this result would not stand after adjusting for multiple testing, as a replication it provided additional evidence that this variant confers pre-eclampsia risk especially since the direction of effect was the same in the present and the previous studies. A second SNP in this gene, rs722503, that was previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia, but only in pregnancies with women over 40, did not show evidence for significance in the current study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Of note, in the age and BMI adjusted model for rs722503 the <italic>p</italic> value did get smaller as compared to the unadjusted model, which is consistent with an age-related effect. This, however, was not surprising as very few pregnancies involved women over 40 (4). In addition, this SNP did not appear in our MDR analyses when all other SNPs were included.</p><p id="Par52">A notable limitation of this study is the non-inclusion of other SNPs that have been shown to be associated with preeclampsia in specific ethnic groups, or more importantly in multi-gene meta-analysis studies involving different ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and in multigene association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. These include the gene variants <italic>of FV, F2, ACE, SERPINE1, AGTR1, MTHFR,</italic> and <italic>MMP-9</italic>. The <italic>ACE</italic> gene variant is an insertion/deletion polymorphism, which cannot be detected by the method used for genotyping in our studies. The other genes, although included in the initial list for analysis, were eventually dropped from the analysis due to technical problems. These genes, however, should be included in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development.
