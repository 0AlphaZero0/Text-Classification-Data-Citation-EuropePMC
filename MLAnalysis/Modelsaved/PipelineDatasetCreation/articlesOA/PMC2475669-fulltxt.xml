This broad range of functions is achieved through specific structures that have been (presumably) optimized through evolution. State-of-the-art methods, such as McCaskill's algorithm, use a statistical mechanics framework based on the computation of the partition function over the <italic>canonical ensemble</italic> of all possible secondary structures on a given sequence. Although secondary structure predictions from thermodynamics-based algorithms are not as accurate as methods employing comparative genomics, the former methods are the only available tools to investigate novel RNAs, such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium. In this paper, we generalize the McCaskill partition function algorithm to sum over the <italic>grand canonical ensemble</italic> of all secondary structures of all mutants of the given sequence. Specifically, our new program, RNAmutants, simultaneously computes for each integer <italic>k</italic> the minimum free energy structure <italic>MFE</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) and the partition function <italic>Z</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) over all secondary structures of all <italic>k</italic>-point mutants, even allowing the user to specify certain positions required not to mutate and certain positions required to base-pair or remain unpaired. This technically important extension allows us to study the resilience of an RNA molecule to pointwise mutations. By computing the <italic>mutation profile</italic> of a sequence, a novel graphical representation of the mutational tendency of nucleotide positions, we analyze the deleterious nature of mutating specific nucleotide positions or groups of positions. We have successfully applied RNAmutants to investigate deleterious mutations (mutations that radically modify the secondary structure) in the Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element and to evaluate the evolutionary pressure applied on different regions of the HIV <italic>trans</italic>-activation response element. In particular, we show qualitative agreement between published Hepatitis C and HIV experimental mutagenesis studies and our analysis of deleterious mutations using RNAmutants. Our work also predicts other deleterious mutations, which could be verified experimentally. Finally, we provide evidence that the 3&#8242; UTR of the GB RNA virus C has been optimized to preserve evolutionarily conserved stem regions from a deleterious effect of pointwise mutations. We hope that there will be long-term potential applications of RNAmutants in de novo RNA design and drug design against RNA viruses. This work also suggests potential applications for large-scale exploration of the RNA sequence-structure network.

This phenomenon can be observed at all levels of the organization of life&#8212;from single molecules to multicellular organisms. Here, we focus our attention on the implication of evolution at the level of nucleic acid sequences. In this context, RNA sequences presumably have been optimized by evolution to achieve specific functions. These functions are supported by a structure that can be determined using thermodynamics-based models and energy minimization techniques. In this work, we develop efficient algorithms for predicting energetically favorable mutations and study their impact on the stability of the structure. We use these techniques to reveal sequences under evolutionary pressure and design new methods to predict lethal mutations.

Apart from messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), there are many important enzymatic and regulatory functions of RNA, and it seems clear that we are far from having discovered all <italic>non-coding</italic> RNA (ncRNA) genes (Non-coding RNA <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Coventry1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Rivas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> is functional RNA that is transcribed, yet does not code for a protein). Indeed, according to the ENCODE Consortium <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-ENCODEProject1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, RNA is &#8220;pervasively expressed&#8221; in the human genome, with approximately 15% of genomic DNA being transcribed, much of it into RNA of no known function.</p><p>The functional diversity of non-coding RNA is enormous, ranging from translating mRNA into proteins via the genetic code (tRNA), to catalyzing the peptidyltransferase reaction in appending an amino acid to the growing peptide (rRNA <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Weinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>), to directing the chemical modifications of specific ribosomal nucleotides (snoRNA <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Omer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>), to the down-regulation of protein product (miRNA <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ambros1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>), to gene up- or down-regulation by transcriptional and translational modification (riboswitches <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Serganov1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>), to the regulation of alternative splicing (<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Cheah1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). To achieve their function, non-coding RNAs (except for small RNAs such as miRNA) require a structure well suited to their role. If we assume that ncRNA sequences have been adapted, or optimized, by evolution to fulfill a specific function, it is natural to believe that their structures have been also optimized or at least conserved. This observation is the basis for a family of methods for secondary structure determination using multiple sequence alignment and comparative sequence analysis <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>RNA is also a molecule governed by fundamental physical laws, and thus folds according to thermodynamic and kinetic principles. Algorithms using experimentally derived free energy parameters <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> for secondary structure prediction have been successfully designed, implemented and applied in mfold <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Zuker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and RNAfold <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Hofacker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. As a consequence, a series of methods combining thermodynamic principles with evolutionary information <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Dowell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Mathews1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> has appeared in the last few years.</p><p>RNA molecules are not static, forever frozen in a native structure, but rather transition from one low energy structure to another (slightly different) low energy structure, due to thermal fluctuations. In his seminal work, J.S. McCaskill <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-McCaskill1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> introduced an algorithm to compute the partition function over all secondary structures as well as the base pairing probabilities. This approach has been significantly extended by Ding and Lawrence <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, who sampled secondary structures from the low energy ensemble.</p><p>There is a growing interest in understanding which nucleotides of structurally important ncRNA are inessential, and may be modified with no phenotypic change, and which nucleotides play a critical role in structure, hence function. Indeed, mutagenesis studies are a popular technique for investigating the structure and function of both RNA and protein. In silico exploration of deleterious mutations in RNA secondary structure have thus far been carried out by exhaustive studies, where an available tool, such as mfold <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Zuker2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, Vienna RNA Package <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Hofacker2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, or Sfold <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, etc. is applied successively to each 1-point mutant, then to each 2-point mutant, etc. depending on sequence length and available computational time; see, for instance Barash <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Barash1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Clearly, this exhaustive technique cannot be used to study the effect of many pointwise mutations in a large sequence. In contrast, the current paper describes an efficient algorithm, RNAmutants, to investigate the minimum free energy structure <italic>MFE<sub>k</sub></italic> and Boltzmann low energy ensemble <italic>&#949;<sub>k</sub></italic> of all secondary structures of all <italic>k</italic>-point mutants, for each value of <italic>k</italic>. In addition to detecting deleterious mutations, RNAmutants could lead to a better understanding of fast-mutating RNA viruses. By understanding fundamental properties of functional RNAs and their robustness to mutation, there may be ultimate applications of our work to the areas of RNA gene discovery and RNA drug design.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a new thermodynamics-based method for the investigation of the mutational secondary structure landscape of a given RNA sequence. State-of-the-art thermodynamics-based, single-molecule methods such as McCaskill's algorithm, use a statistical mechanics framework based on the computation of the partition function over the <italic>canonical ensemble</italic> of all possible secondary structures on a given sequence. Unfortunately, methods such as Zuker's algorithm for minimum free energy structure <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Zuker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, McCaskill's algorithm for the partition function <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-McCaskill1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and the sampling method of Ding and Lawrence <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, do not permit any modification of the input sequence during their execution and thus cannot investigate the mutation landscape of a sequence, except by exhaustive enumeration of all mutated sequences. Indeed, the highly original work on <italic>neutral networks</italic> due to Peter Schuster and the Vienna group <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Grner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Schuster1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> reposes on such experiments where RNAfold is applied to all 4<italic><sup>n</sup></italic> many RNA sequences of length <italic>n</italic>. The theory of neutral network is still an active area of research&#8212;see the recent review of Cowperthwaite and Meyers <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Cowperthwaite1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It follows that RNAmutants could be useful for further studies of these networks.</p><p>Consequently, except for small exhaustive enumeration studies, such as in the work of Barash <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Barash1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, no group has been able to answer questions like the following. <italic>What is energetically the most favorable secondary structure adopted by an arbitrary k-point mutant, possibly subject to preserving the location of specific binding sites and possibly constrained by requiring certain positions to be paired resp. unpaired? If an RNA molecule is under evolutionary pressure to adopt a low energy structure, subject to certain constraints (binding site, catalytic core), then which positions are most likely to be mutated and what is the consensus sequence and secondary structure of the low energy ensemble.</italic>
</p><p>There may be objections to what may seem to be yet another thermodynamics-based RNA structure algorithm that we present in this paper, since it is known that RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms that incorporate comparative genomics (multiple structural alignments) generally predict structure more accurately than do single-molecule, thermodynamics-based algorithms such as mfold, RNAfold, and Sfold. See work of Gardner and Giegerich <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, who show for instance the more accurate performance of Pfold, a program of Knudsen and Hein <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> that depends on an explicit evolutionary model and a probabilistic model for structures.</p><p>There are two answers to this objection. First, our program RNAmutants performs computations and admits biological applications that no other software can realize, regardless of whether the software is based thermodynamics or comparative genomics. Second, recent findings of the <sc>encode</sc> project consortium <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-ENCODEProject1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> indicate that the human genome is &#8220;pervasively expressed,&#8221; with many RNA transcripts of unknown function having no homology to known RNA families. While comparative genomics has successfully been used to investigate the structure and evolution of RNAs for which reliable multiple alignments exist, only thermodynamics-based methods can be applied to novel RNAs, such as those reported by the <sc>encode</sc> consortium. Given the existence of highly reliable, multiple structural alignments of RNAs of the same class, it makes sense to apply comparative genomics methods, such as Pfold of Knudsen and Hein <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Knudsen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammar (phylo-SCFG) program EvoFold of Pedersen et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, or the Bayesian MCMC program SimulFold of Meyer and Mikl&#243;s <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the absence of highly reliable multiple alignments, such as with the raw data of the encode consortium, thermodynamics-based algorithms are not just the only alternative, but such algorithms in general perform rather well. Indeed, on average, the predicted MFE structure contains 73% of known base-pairs when tested on domains of fewer than 700 nt; cf. Mathews et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Mathews2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>In previous work <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Waldispuhl1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we introduced a novel formal grammar framework (AMSAG) to compute the <italic>&#948;</italic>-superoptimal structure. By <italic>&#948;</italic>-superoptimal structure, we mean the minimum free energy (MFE) structure among all sequences <italic>&#969;&#8242;</italic> with a string edit cost of at most <italic>&#948;</italic> from the input sequence <italic>&#969;</italic> (i.e., <italic>&#969;&#8242;</italic> such that <italic>d</italic>(<italic>&#969;</italic>,<italic>&#969;&#8242;</italic>)&#8804;<italic>&#948;</italic> for a given edit distance <italic>d</italic>). Hence, in principle AMSAG can handle any edit operation (e.g., mutation, insertion, and deletion). However, in addition to the difficulty of estimating good edit costs, the time required to compute the <italic>&#948;</italic>-superoptimal structures can be prohibitive, even for small values of <italic>&#948;</italic>.</p><p>To overcome these problems, in subsequent work <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Clote1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, we refined the problem by restricting our sequence search space to <italic>k</italic>-mutants (i.e., sequences differing of exactly <italic>k</italic> mutations with the input sequence). This simplification allowed us to design and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the partition function over all secondary structures of all <italic>k</italic> -point mutants, with respect to the Nussinov energy model <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Nussinov1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. (The Nussinov energy model ascribes an energy of &#8722;1 per base pair, while ignoring any destabilization due to loops. In contrast, the Turner energy model <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> ascribes experimentally measured, context-dependent free energies for base stacking, as well as positive, destabilizing free energies for various types of loops: hairpins, bulges, internal loops and multiloops. It is well-known that the Nussinov energy model is too simplistic to permit reasonable applications of the kind presented in this paper.)</p><p>However, due to AMSAG's generality, it is technically difficult to incorporate the full Turner energy model <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> into the AMSAG framework. In order to circumvent these difficulties, we have designed new multiple recursions, allowing for a technical breakthrough to develop RNAmutants, a unified algorithm to compute the minimum free energy structure <italic>MFE</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) and partition function <italic>Z</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) over all <italic>k</italic>-point mutants of a given RNA sequence, even admitting <italic>constraints</italic> of two forms&#8212;sequence identity constraints (certain positions, such as those known to be important for protein binding are not allowed to mutate), and structural constraints (certain positions are required to pair or to be unpaired). RNAmutants uses the state-of-the-art Turner energy model <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>
<italic>without</italic> dangles. (A dangle is a single-stranded nucleotide, occurring either 5&#8242; or 3&#8242; to a base pair. This energy model corresponds to RNAfold -d 0 in the Vienna RNA Package. In a first implementation with dangles, the computational overhead caused by including dangles was so prohibitive that we decided not to implement them in the final version of RNAmutants.)</p><p>Using our partition function, we explore the mutation landscape of a given RNA sequence by sampling not from the uniform distribution of <italic>k</italic>-point mutants, but rather from the Boltzmann distribution of low energy <italic>k</italic>-point mutants.</p><p>RNAmutants naturally extends the classical RNA secondary structure model. Instead of considering the set of secondary structures that can be built on the input sequence alone, as do mfold, RNAfold, and Sfold, we consider all secondary structures of all sequences with at most <italic>k</italic> mutations. In other words, given an RNA sequence of length <italic>n</italic> and an integer <italic>k</italic>
<sub>max</sub>&#8804;<italic>n</italic>, we compute the partition function <italic>Z<sub>k</sub></italic> over all secondary structures of all <italic>k</italic>-point mutants, for all <italic>0</italic>&#8804;<italic>k</italic>&#8804;<italic>k</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. When <italic>k</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0, we obtain McCaskill's partition function. The approach is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000124-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000124.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the <italic>k</italic>-mutant Boltzmann ensemble sampled by RNAmutants.</title><p>The input RNA sequence is represented at the center while the <italic>k</italic>-neighbourhoods (Here <italic>k</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 1, 2) are represented by concentric rings.

A novelty of our algorithm is to sample mutations according to their weight in the Boltzmann ensemble. This result generalizes the RNA secondary structure sampling algorithm of Ding and Lawrence <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. From sampling, we derive a novel method to predict mutations disrupting the secondary structure of the original sequence (a.k.a. deleterious mutations).</p><p>Here, we provide a technical breakthrough far beyond brute force computational techniques in the work of Barash <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Barash1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and of Shu et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Shu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Since there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000124.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, or roughly <italic>n<sup>k</sup></italic>, many <italic>k</italic>-point mutants of an RNA sequence of length <italic>n</italic>, any method relying on exhaustive listing of all <italic>k</italic>-point mutants has only a limited range of applicability.</p><p>We tested our algorithms on six different families of RNA sequences from Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency viruses available in the Rfam database <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, as well as the 3&#8242; UTR of GB virus C. We then compared our results with experimental studies <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, to investigate the robustness of RNA structures and the nature of deleterious mutations. We performed five types of computational experiments, thus showing the range of possibilities afforded by RNAmutants. First, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of RNAmutants by computing the partition function over all possible mutants (i.e., all <italic>k</italic>-mutants, for <italic>0</italic>&#8804;<italic>k</italic>&#8804;<italic>n</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is sequence length), and by sampling we estimate the probability of mutation of each nucleotide of the given sequence. Second, we analyze the robustness of RNA structures to point-wise mutations of the wild-type sequence, over a collection of 2806 sequences taken from five different families of RNA elements from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). From our analysis of HCV and HIV, we make some observations concerning possible application to RNA gene discovery and drug design. Third, using previously published experimental results <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, we evaluate the accuracy of our predictions of deleterious mutation predictions for the hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (HCV CRE). We suggest new possible mutation sites which have not been previously detected or tested. Fourth, we show how our techniques can be used to identify regions that have been constrained during evolution to conserve patterns preserving the (functional) structure of a given RNA. In this fashion we can predict nucleotide sites likely to be under <italic>purifying</italic> selective pressure. Taken altogether, our applications of RNAmutants provide a better identification and understanding of those critical areas of an RNA secondary structure. Finally, by scanning of the 3&#8242; UTR of the GB RNA virus C with a fixed size frame, we show how RNAmutants can be used to perform genome-scale analysis and offer a novel insight inside the genome structure that cannot be achieved through other approaches. More specifically, we provide evidence that the sequence has been optimized to preserve evolutionarily conserved stem regions from a deleterious effect of pointwise mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We present in this section the theoretical results achieved in this paper.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>McCaskill's Partition Function</title><p>We build our algorithms upon the seminal McCaskill's recursions <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-McCaskill1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Disruption of binding ability caused by a mutation leading to a different structure would be termed deleterious.</p><p>The prediction of deleterious mutations has recently emerged as a useful and promising research direction <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Barash1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Shu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Unlike the approach using RNAmutants, such approaches are limited and cannot be applied to long sequences and/or with more than one or two mutations. Consequently, such traditional approaches could well miss potentially critical mutations or groups of mutations.</p><p>Our method is described as follows. Given a wild-type sequence and its <italic>native structure</italic> (by native structure, we mean either the secondary structure inferred from the X-ray crystal, or in the absence of crystal structures, the secondary structure inferred by comparative sequence analysis. Often we take the Rfam consensus structure as the native structure), we use RNAmutants to sample an ensemble of 1000 <italic>k</italic>-point mutant sequences and their structures, for each value of <italic>k</italic>, from 0 to the maximum number of mutation allowed, denoted by <italic>k</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. (If not stipulated as part of the input, then <italic>k</italic>
<sub>max</sub>
<italic>&#8202;=&#8202;n</italic>.) To ensure the pertinence of our approach, we first verify that the centroid secondary structure at level 0 (i.e., no mutation) is close to the native structure. Here, by <italic>centroid</italic> structure, not to be confused with Rfam consensus structure, we mean the secondary structure consisting of those base pairs, whose frequency of occurrence in the sampled set is strictly greater than 0.5. Then, at each level 1&#8804;<italic>k</italic>&#8804;<italic>k</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, we probe the samples and extract the sequence and structure such that the base pair associated with the mutation does not belong to the native structure. Alternative experiments or more flexible criteria can be adopted, but the latter seemed to give the best compromise between the number of candidates and the relevance of the structural deterioration.</p><p>We measured the deleterious effect of a base pair in the mutant structure, which does not occur in the native structure, by using a value called the <italic>break</italic> number. The break number is computed as the number of base pairs that must be removed from the native structure to prevent the formation of a pseudoknot or base triple, if we force the presence of the base pair created by the mutation. In this fashion we quantify the deleterious effect induced by the newly created base pair. A break number of 0 indicates that the new base pair is compatible with the native structure and does not create any pseudoknot or base triple. In lieu of measuring break number, we could have computed the base pair distance between mutant and native structure; however, two topologically very similar structures can have large base pair distance. For instance, both of the structures</p><p>GGGGGGGGACCCCCCCC&#8195;GGGGGGGGACCCCCCCC</p><p>((((((.....))))))&#8195;.((((((....))))))</p><p>are very similar, and both have free energy of &#8722;13.80 kcal/mol, yet their base pair distance is 12. For this reason, we introduce and use break number.</p><p>Deleterious mutations extracted from the sample set are ranked according to their deleterious effect, i.e., in decreasing order, sorted by break number. A ranking based on the frequency of occurrence of the mutation would not have been necessarily a wise choice. Indeed, this approach would have highlighted those mutations that lower folding energy, since these would the largest weight in the Boltzmann ensemble. Deleterious mutations that break the native structure do not necessarily improve the MFE in the first steps and hence would appear with a lower frequency in the sample set.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>We present here the results of our computational experiments, compare them with previously published experimental results, and discuss their significance.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Evaluation of the Nucleotide Mutation Propensity and Exploration of the Complete Mutation Landscape</title><p>We illustrate in this section the computational efficiency of RNAmutants by exploring the full mutation landscape of a family of RNA sequences (i.e., we compute the partition function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000124.e035.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for all 0&#8804;<italic>k</italic>&#8804;<italic>n</italic>).

In the case of Hepatitis C virus stem-loop IV (HCV SLIV), the secondary structure given by the consensus Rfam seed alignment is a single stem with a tight hairpin loop, without any structural irregularity such as a bulge or internal loop. Such a secondary structure for HCV SLIV is energetically favorable and cannot be drastically improved. Thus, the mutations will tend to conserve the structure and improve the base stacking free energies, while preserving the same base-paired positions. Since the stacking of GC base pairs provides the lowest stacking free energy, all non-GC base pairs will tend to be substituted by GC in the first steps. The sequence logo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g005">Figure 5A</xref> confirms this intuition, showing that positions with a clear preference for the nucleotide U, and base-paired with a G in the consensus structure are the first to mutate. Subsequently the nucleotide A tends to be affected, while C and G are relatively well conserved.</p><p>All columns present a strictly monotone gradient of color from white to black, thus suggesting that preferred mutation sites are independent and ordered. In addition, the mutation profile shows an alternation of white columns (groups of residues which start to mutate with small value of <italic>k</italic>) and black columns (groups of residues which mutate late). Here, it appears that base-paired positions evolve simultaneously (see, for instance, the motif AU at index 13&#8211;14 and UA at index 22&#8211;23), presenting examples of compensatory mutations. This phenomenon reveals a stability in the base-pairing of the regions involved, certain to be of interest in RNA design.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g005">Figure 5B</xref> we plot the superposed curves of <italic>k</italic>-superoptimal free energies and <italic>k</italic>-mutant ensemble free energies, as computed by RNAmutants; the <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the number of mutations and the <italic>y</italic>-axis the energy in kcal/mol.

The current usage seems more appropriate.) These results provide a novel insight into preferential mutation sites as well as structural impacts caused by mutations.</p><p>We now analyze the curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g005">Figure 5B</xref>. While the ensemble free energy curve resembles a parabola, the superoptimal free energy curve shows three distinct regions (<italic>k</italic>&#8804;5, then 6&#8804;<italic>k</italic>&#8804;17, and 18&#8804;<italic>k</italic>), each having a linear appearance. Each region reflects the phenomenon described above. From <italic>k</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 0 to <italic>k</italic> &#8202;=&#8202; 5, the GU base pairs are progressively substituted by GC and the slope is roughly equal to the difference of the stacking free energies associated with both base pairs. Then, the region from <italic>k</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;6 to <italic>k</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;17 is associated with the substitution of AU base pairs by GC, which now requires 2 mutations with a smaller gain of energy. Other optimizations, such as the reordering of nucleotides G and C inside the stem, only bring minor energy improvements and are then performed in the last region (18&#8804;<italic>k</italic>) which presents a flat free energy profile. The characteristic shape of the superoptimal energy curve may be of interest for characterizing sequences that require an optimal secondary structure.</p><p>Interestingly, the 5-nucleotide hairpin is very well conserved over sample centroid structures (base pairs with a frequency &gt;0.5 in the sample set&#8212;data not shown), even for large values of <italic>k</italic>. Indeed, a tetraloop hairpin might have been expected, due to the energy bonuses assigned to GNRA-tetraloops.

(In work of Ding et al. <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the sample centroid is called the <italic>Boltzmann centroid</italic>, when sampling over all secondary structures using Sfold <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Ding2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.) This distance is called the centroid distance in the following.</p><p>A small average distance means that most sampled structures are identical to the native structure (this entails a small centroid distance as well). A large average distance with a small centroid distance indicates that the core of the native structure is conserved in the sampled structures, while most sampled structures differ from the native structure with respect to a number of base pairs. In this case, the nonnative base pairs in the samples are not well conserved over the ensemble of sampled structures, hence do not appear in the centroid structure. In contrast, a large centroid distance indicates that the same nonnative base pairs are present (or missing) in the majority of sampled structures.</p><p>To benchmark robustness, we used (seed) multiple sequence alignments from Rfam <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

These results suggest that the RNA nucleotide sequence of HCV SLIV has been thermodynamically optimized and is robust with respect to mutations. In contrast, the secondary structure of sampled mutants of Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (HCV CRE) is increasingly divergent as the number of mutations increases. The secondary structure of wild-type HCV CRE sequence is very well predicted by energy minimization methods. The centroid structure of samples generated by RNAmutants, for one to three mutations, changes little and remains very close to the native structure, even if most of the sampled structures have more base pairs than that of the native structure. However, when four or more mutations are allowed, another structure, significantly different from the native one, emerges from the ensemble generated by RNAmutants. This result suggests that HCV CRE has been optimized to resist only a few mutations. This remark suggests the use of RNAmutants to detect those sequences whose structure is locally optimized.</p><p>At level 0 (no mutation allowed), in spite of a higher average distance, the centroid structure of the ensemble of samples of HIV RNA elements remains close to the native structure. Interestingly, average distance remains approximately constant when the number of mutations increases. This number even decreases for human immunodeficiency virus primer binding site (HIV PBS). Here again, analysis of mutants generated by RNAmutants seems to confirm the optimization of these sequences to support some functional secondary structure. We note that with similar characteristics (length and number of base pairs) the human immunodeficiency virus frameshit signal (HIV FE) structure appears to be more robust with respect to mutations than is the Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (HCV CRE). The centroid structure of human immunodeficiency virus primer binding site (HIV PBS) seems well conserved. In analogy to the phenomenon observed for the Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (HIV CRE), the average distance increase suggests that an alternate structure will emerge as the number of mutations increases. Summarizing, we feel that the combination of average and centroid distance measurements is a reasonable tool to estimate the robustness of a structure under mutational variation of a sequence.</p><p>Remarkably, the average and centroid distances are very well conserved in human immunodeficiency virus gag stem loop 3 (HIV GSL3), in spite of the huge hairpin loop (69 nucleotides) and very small stem (8 base pairs). One must bear in mind that Rfam consensus structures indicate only those base pairs that are inferred by covariation. It follows that many base pairs may not appear in the centroid structure, such as the 69-nt hairpin. Each of the 8 base pairs in HIV GSL3 is a GC pair, which means that this stem region is not optimized by RNAmutants for the small numbers of mutations <italic>k</italic>. This supports the idea that the mutation robustness of the hairpin loop sequence is optimized.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Prediction of deleterious mutations in Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element</title><p>In this section, we predict deleterious mutations in Hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element using the method described in section Using sampling to predict deleterious mutations in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>.

This prediction is confirmed by <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In this study, You et al. observed that the mutant C84A/U86G is not viable, while C84A/U86A is still functional. Additionally, it was observed <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> that the mutation U86G is responsible for the alteration of the upper helix (subsequence from nucleotide 8 to 31 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and hence deleterious. However, their results also showed that the single point mutation U86G is still viable, suggesting that this mutation must be supported by C84A to be deleterious. In fact, C84A is suspected to alter the stability of the upper helix, amplifying the ability of U86G to disrupt the structure. The slight overestimation of the deleterious potential of U86G is due to the quality of the energy model used by RNAmutants. Without dangles, the centroid structure is effectively altered by U86G, while with dangles, the mutation C84A is required to disrupt the upper helix (data not shown). The difference is then due to the absence of dangles in the energy model of RNAmutants. However, the deleterious effect of U86G is correctly detected.</p><p>The non-viability of other mutants studied in <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> (U71C, C74U, A75U/G76C/C77U, C77U, C90A/A92G, A92G, and C90A) is not attributed to a significant alteration of the native secondary structure.

Most of these mutations are similar. Assuming that these mutants are viable, this suggests that some of these additional mutations offset the deleterious effect of C35G or C36G. A complete analysis of all these sequences would be too demanding, but we can illustrate this phenomenon by looking at the 3 sequences associated with C35G.</p><p>Three mutations (A15U, C25G, and A39G) are found simultaneously in all occurrences of C35U. The mutations C25G and A15U are located at the extremities of the hairpin loop in the native structure, and more specifically, C25G creates a potential base pair with nucleotide U at index 14 (and potentially also with nucleotide U at index 15). We conclude that these two mutations tend to stabilize the upper helix and counterbalance the deleterious effect of C35G. The role of A39G remains more obscure. In <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, You et al. observed that this mutation (A92G in the paper) is lethal. However, structure probing did not reveal any irregularity in the cleavage product of this RNA, suggesting that the sequence of the bulge is affected rather than the global structure. A potential structural use of this mutation would be to prevent the creation of base pairs supporting the disruption of the upper helix through C35G. An analysis using the thermodynamic model with RNAmutants tends to support this hypothesis.</p><p>An interesting case is for A11G which occurs, in a single sequence (AF054264.1:326&#8211;376) from the Rfam seed alignment, together with A1G. This has been reported as one of the clones used in <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Yanagi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. From this study, it remains unclear how replication is affected by these mutations; however, the possibility of a deleterious effect of A11G is potentiality (indirectly) supported by this work.</p><p>The following group of predicted deleterious mutations involves the nucleotide C at position 29, either directly (C29G) or indirectly through a base pair (C19G, U16G, C12G). If no specific analysis has been performed for this mutation, it appears that C29G can be found in two nonviable mutants (5BSL3.2 mutA and 5BSL3.2 mutB) in <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The deleterious nature of C29G has not been validated, but the destabilization effect of this mutation in the upper helix is suggestive.</p><p>Other minor mutations which do not disrupt the native structure are identified. With a break number of 0, these mutations cannot be considered as deleterious. However, some of them have been detected to alter replication (C74U and C77U or C21U and C24U in our notation) in <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-You1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. One potential explanation suggested by our results is that the local structure of the hairpin loop is affected, rather than that of the global secondary structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Scan of HIV <italic>trans</italic>-activation response reveals regions under evolutionary pressure</title><p>In this section, we show how RNAmutants can be used to detect regions of the sequence which have been optimized during evolution.

Our results reveal critical regions in the <italic>trans</italic>-activation response element of the human immunodeficiency virus and suggest applications for RNA drug design.</p><p>For this study, we use sequences of human immunodeficiency virus <italic>trans</italic>-activation response (HIV TAR) from the HIV-1 genome. The Rfam seed alignment contains 426 sequences of length 57 nt with an average identity of 91%. This RNA element is critical for the <italic>trans</italic>-activation of the viral protomer and virus replication. The TAR hairpin acts as a binding site for the Tat protein and this interaction stimulates the activity of the long terminal repeat promoter. Previous studies have shown that the 3 nt bulge from index 22 to 24 is essential for binding <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

A clear signal appears at index 35&#8211;36 and 40&#8211;41: Both curves (average and centroid) show a clear peak at these positions. The regions associated with this signal correspond exactly to the 3&#8242;-end regions involved in the two stems S1 and S2. We observe a mirror effect when the frame matches the 5&#8242;-end regions; two other peaks emerge at index 18 and 25&#8211;26. Interestingly, the magnitude of these two peaks is significantly lower than those of the first ones, indicating that the 3&#8242; regions have been potentially under a higher selective pressure.</p><p>When two mutations are allowed inside the frame (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), the phenomenon observed above is amplified. The asymmetry between the two paired regions of S2 is almost cancelled, but not for those of S1. In addition, a clear signal now appears when the frame matches the bulge. It may also be interpreted as a signal indicating that this region has been constrained along evolution.</p><p>Finally, when three mutations are performed inside the frame (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), the signals mentioned before can still be identified, but tend to be washed out by the noise. Indeed, when all positions in the frame mutate, the sequence is so denatured that the conservation of the secondary structure would require an optimization of the surrounding sequence. This remark is related to the observation given below for the hairpin region.</p><p>Additionally, two clear peaks now appear when the frame matches the paired region of the stem S2. This may be a correction of the weakness of the signal observed in the previous graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). It also confirms that both these regions may have been optimized to base-pair.</p><p>For these three graphs, it is remarkable to notice that mutations inside the subsequence of the hairpin never really affect the global structure of the RNA element. It may be suggested that the sequence outside the hairpin has been optimized to prohibit any stable interaction with the central region in order to stabilize the secondary structure and facilitate the formation of the complex 3D motifs observed in <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Kulinski1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>According to these observations, four sequence optimizations may have been performed for these sequences. The first two are for the regions paired to each other through the stem S1 and S2. This may be justified by the need for these sequences to pair to each other in order to stabilize the bulge and the hairpin lying between them. It also appears that the sequence of the bulge cannot tolerate two mutations. Our analysis suggests that evolutionary pressure has selected these nucleotides to facilitate the formation of the bulge required for the binding. Finally, the global structure does not seem to be affected by mutations inside the hairpin loop. As it has been said before, this suggests an optimization of the surrounding sequence to stabilize this loop and allow the formation of a complex 3D motif inside the apical loop.</p><p>These results suggest that a method combining RNA binding predictors <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Dimitrov1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and secondary structure prediction software <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Zuker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Hofacker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with RNAmutants could be a successful and promising approach for the prediction and design of functional RNAs.</p><p>Scan of the 3&#8242; UTR of GB virus C reveals how evolution shaped the sequence. We conclude the results section with a series of computational experiments on the 3&#8242; UTR of the GB virus C (GBV-C). By scanning this RNA sequence, we show how RNAmutants can provide evidence that different regions have been optimized to conserve RNA secondary structure even in the presence of pointwise mutations.

As expected when no mutation is allowed (i.e., <italic>k</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;0), he base pair density appears to be higher for base pairs in stem regions. This means that these regions are more structured than the others. (This argument does not suggest that nonstem regions are not structured but only that they are locally less optimized.) However, when the number of mutations increases, all curves tend to reach an equilibrium, with approximately equal density for each of the five cases. While density for base pairs in the same stem, case 1, decreases with an increasing number of mutations, density for the other four cases increases. This phenomenon suggests that selective pressure has been applied to ensure robustness of (local) structure in the 3&#8242; UTR GBV-C RNA with respect to mutation.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g010">Figure 10A</xref> reveals that in the close neighborhood (small number of mutations) of the wild sequence, the mutations occurring in a stem region base-pair preferentially inside the same stem region. An increase in the number of mutations has very different consequences on the density of base pairs in the different clusters. In agreement with our previous observations, the number of mutations created inside the same stem region decreases. In contrast, if the densities increase in the two other cases, we observe a clear preference for creating a base pair outside any other stem region. Indeed, while the behavior of the two curves (base-pairing in another distinct stem region, and outside) have similar behavior for small number of mutations, it turns out that roughly beyond 4 mutations, more mutations tend to base-pair outside and &#8220;protect&#8221; as much as possible the cleavage between the stem regions.</p><p>Symmetrically, when few mutations are performed outside the stem regions (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g010">Figure 10B</xref>), we observe a clear preference for base pairings in the same region, thus preserving the stems from destabilization by mutations occurring in the nonstem regions. However, in agreement with previous observations, larger numbers of mutations tend to progressively equilibrate the distributions by increasing the base pair density of mutations base pairing in stem regions. This observation suggests that non-stem regions have been constrained to prevent mutations from interacting with stems to disrupt the structure.</p><p>We now investigate the distribution of mutations that increase the base pairing probability (called <italic>base pair increasing mutations</italic>), versus those that decrease base pairing probability (called <italic>base pair decreasing mutations</italic>). To evaluate the evolution of these probabilities from one level of mutation <italic>k</italic> to the next <italic>k</italic>+1, we compare the local base pairing probabilities <italic>p<sup>k</sup></italic> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) computed from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000124.e044.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (e.g., sample set with <italic>k</italic> mutations) with those computed from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000124.e045.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. Then, we estimate the difference <italic>p<sup>k</sup></italic>
<sup>+1</sup> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>)&#8722;<italic>p<sup>k</sup></italic> (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>), subsequently called the <italic>differential probability</italic>. We show the corresponding curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g011">Figure 11</xref>, where the results have been once again classified into five clusters.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000124-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000124.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Differential probability of mutation associated with a base pair increasing mutation (A) or a base pair decreasing mutation (B).</title><p>The <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the number <italic>k</italic> of mutations, while the <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the differential probability <italic>p<sup>k</sup></italic>

Indeed, when a single mutation is performed, we first observe a tendency to stabilize the structures already existing in and out the stem regions, thus conserving the existing structure of the full 3&#8242; UTR GBV-C RNA sequence. However, afterward, an increased number of mutations tends to be more favorable to mutations strengthening the base pairs between a stem and a non-stem region. Simultaneously the probability of mutations favoring base pairs inside stem regions increases to a lesser extent. Interestingly, if the probability of base pair increasing mutations for bases occurring between two distinct stem regions seems also to increase for small values of <italic>k</italic>, it turns out that these probabilities tend to remain identical afterwards (e.g., the differential values decrease).</p><p>The case of base pair decreasing mutations is in fact much more interesting since essentially only base pairs inside stem regions seem significantly affected by such mutations, although single mutations appear not to have any significant effect (differential probability close to zero). The two next levels (<italic>K</italic>&#8202;=&#8202;2, 3) present a remarkable peak which completely collapses for a further increasing number of mutations (<italic>k</italic>&#8805;4). The negative values indicate that the probability of base pair decreasing mutations inside the stem are decreasing, and thus that stabilization occurs once a few mutations have been occurred to locally reorganize the structure. This clear signal could prove useful in detecting structured regions of a genome, and possibly help identify subsequences under evolutionary pressure. Interestingly, the change of sign of the differential base pairing probability in the same stem region happens for 4 mutations, which correlates with the putative inflection point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000124-g009">Figure 9</xref> for the base pair density curve for the same cluster of base pairs.</p><p>Finally, we study the distribution of mutations in the complete 3&#8242; UTR GBV-C RNA sequence. In complement to the previous experiments performed with a frame size of 50 nucleotides and thus restricted to local considerations, we now also provide an insight on the influence of mutations, sampled from the Boltzmann <italic>k</italic>-point mutant ensemble, on the medium and long range base pairing by including statistics computed with larger frame sizes. Using the equation 14, we estimate the mutation base pair probability in the sample set and derive the <italic>average mutation probability</italic> from these values.</p><p>The <italic>average mutation probability</italic> at index <italic>i</italic> in a sample set of <italic>k</italic>-point mutants is defined as the sum of the mutation base pair probabilities <italic>m<sub>k</sub><sup>L</sup></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) (i.e., <italic>m<sub>k</sub><sup>L</sup></italic>(<italic>i</italic>)&#8202;=&#8202;&#931;<italic><sub>j</sub> m<sub>k</sub><sup>L</sup></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>)). Additionally, in order to investigate the influence of medium and long range base pairing on the mutation distribution, we also computed the values of <italic>m<sub>k</sub><sup>L</sup></italic>(<italic>i</italic>) restricted to base pairs (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) with |<italic>j</italic>&#8722;<italic>i</italic>|&#8805;25.

The numerical results given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000124-t003">Table 3</xref> summarize these statistics for the general case as well as the case of mutations involved in a medium to long range base pair, i.e., base pairs (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) whose extremities <italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic> are at a distance of at least 25 nucleotides.

Frame sizes larger than 150 nucleotides have not been considered since only few base pairs distanced at more than 150 nt appeared in our sample sets.

This observation suggests that in the fitness model <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Cowperthwaite1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Fontana1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pcbi.1000124-Cowperthwaite2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, evolution has constrained medium and long range base pairing to favor mutations outside evolutionarily conserved stem regions. This remark automatically suggests the potential usefulness of RNAmutants in gene discovery based on clustering of RNAmutants statistics. This hypothesis is the subject of current research on larger scale studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1000124.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>RNAfold (a) and RNAplfold (b) Dotplots of the 3&#8242; UTR GB Virus C.
