Sodorifen (IUPAC name: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethyl-3-methylenebicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene) is a recently identified and unusual volatile hydrocarbon that is emitted by the rhizobacterium <italic>Serratia plymuthica</italic> 4R&#215;13. Sodorifen comprises a bicyclic ring structure solely consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, where every carbon atom of the skeleton is substituted with either a methyl or a methylene group. This unusual feature of sodorifen made a prediction of its biosynthetic origin very difficult and so far its biosynthesis is unknown. To unravel the biosynthetic pathway we performed genome and transcriptome analyses to identify candidate genes. One knockout mutant (<italic>SOD_c20750</italic>) showed the desired negative sodorifen phenotype. Here it was shown for the first time that this gene is indispensable for the synthesis of sodorifen and strongly supports the hypothesis that sodorifen descends from the terpene metabolism. <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> is the first bacterial terpene cyclase isolated from <italic>Serratia</italic> spp. and Enterobacteriales. Homology modeling revealed a 3D structure, which exhibits a functional role of amino acids for intermediate cation stabilization (W325) and putative proton acception (Y332). Moreover, the size and hydrophobicity of the active site strongly indicates that indeed the enzyme may catalyze the unusual compound sodorifen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Serratia</italic></kwd><kwd>bacterial terpene cyclase</kwd><kwd>sodorifen</kwd><kwd>volatile organic compound</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Pi153/28</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant and animal volatile emissions and volatile&#8211;based interactions are well known. Only recently it emerged that microorganisms also emanate a wealth of diverse volatiles and complex volatile mixtures (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Effmert et al., 2012</xref>). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced in the microbial world occur in the biosphere in concentrations over several orders of magnitude, and they are ideal infochemicals because their spheres of actions include &#8216;aqueous&#8217; as well as &#8216;atmospheric&#8217; diffusion (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wheatley, 2002</xref>). The ecological functions of microbial VOCs (mVOCs) are largely unknown, but in principal they can act as signals for communication between various organisms, or serve as attractant or defense compounds. For example, VOCs of rhizobacteria inhibit the growth of various fungi by reducing sporulation, inhibiting mycelium growth, altering hyphal morphology, or inhibiting spore germination (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alstr&#246;m, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wheatley, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fernando et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kai et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Microbial VOCs also affect morphology and physiology of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wenke et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the production and emission of blends from rhizobacterial and plant-colonizing bacterial isolates revealed VOC mixtures of different complexity, e.g., <italic>Serratia plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 emits at least 100 compounds (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kai et al., 2010</xref>). A literature survey revealed the first microbial volatile database &#8216;mVOC&#8217; (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lemfack et al., 2014</xref>) comprising to date approximately 1500 mVOCs released from ca. 450 bacterial and fungal species/isolates. Many more mVOCs are expected to be synthesized in nature, because (i) more than 10<sup>17</sup> bacterial species exist on earth, and (ii) complexity and diversity of volatile blends depends on the metabolic activities, e.g., correlating with growth conditions, of the organisms. Interestingly, many unidentified compounds are emitted by bacteria, which remain to be structurally elucidated. In this regard, our present interest was focused on <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13, since its VOC profile was dominated by one single new compound (relative contribution ca. 45%) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kai et al., 2010</xref>). While the biological and ecological function of this compound remains elusive, we used a combination of MS and NMR techniques to elucidate the structure of the target compound: the volatile is 1,2,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethyl-3-methylenebicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene (sodorifen) which was confirmed by total synthesis (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">von Reuss et al., 2010</xref>). Sodorifen has an extremely unusual structure, it is a polymethylated bicyclus (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) and a prediction of its biosynthesis was previously impossible.

Volatile compounds of the headspace of three 24 h intervals (air flow 1.1 ml/min) were trapped on the absorbent SuperQ (50 mg, brand new SuperQ to avoid cross-contamination; Alltech, IL, USA). The trapped VOCs were eluted with dichloromethane (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Nonyl acetate (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added as internal standard (stock solution 5 ng/10 &#956;g), peak in the chromatogram corresponds to 5 ng.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Volatile Compounds by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Samples were analyzed with the Shimadzu GC/MS-QP500 system (Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a DB5-MS column (60 m &#215; 0.25 mm &#215; 0.25 &#956;m; J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Before sample analysis always a control run was performed to preclude detection of residual compounds of previous analyses. Samples of 1 &#956;l were injected splitless or with a split ratio of 1:25 at 200&#176;C with a solvent delay of 2 min using a CTC autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. The capillary was equipped with diphenyl (dimethyl) polysiloxan with 5% phenyl groups (DB05). The mass fragments were selected based on their mass to charge ratio using a quadrupole mass analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded using scan mode (70 eV, <italic>m/z</italic> = 40&#8211;280). The selected masses were analyzed with the software Lab Solution (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany). To determine the structure of the volatile compounds, the mass spectra were compared with those of the Mass Spectral Library of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST107).</p></sec><sec><title>Polymerase Chain Reaction</title><p>The amplification of DNA fragments was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A standard PCR was performed using Taq polymerase I (overexpressed; Department of Biochemistry, University of Rostock, Germany). DNA was isolated with NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel, D&#252;ren, Germany). For long amplification products (&gt;3 kb), the High-Fidelity Polymerase <italic>Pfu</italic> or Phusion<sup>&#174;</sup> (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used. Amplification reactions were conducted in a total volume of 50 &#956;l, consisting of 1 &#956;l of 10 mM dNTP-Mix, 1 &#956;l of each primer, 1 &#956;l template DNA, 0.5 &#956;l polymerase with or without the proofreading function, 10 &#956;l buffer, and 35 &#956;l nuclease-free water. Primers were designed according to the gene properties (temperature, GC content, and secondary structures) and were usually 21 nucleotides long, with the exception of the oligonucleotides for mutagenesis, which were 72 nucleotides long. A complete list of primers can be found in <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref></bold>. The annealing temperature for the amplification of DNA depended on the temperature of the primers (x), and the elongation time (y) was selected according to the size of the gene or DNA (1 kb/min). All primers were ordered from Sigma&#8211;Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR was performed in a Biometra PCR-cycler (G&#246;ttingen, Germany) or a Hybaid PCR-cycler (Ulm, Germany). Buffer, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, dNTPs, and polymerase were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The PCR program for the Taq polymerase was performed for 30 cycles (94&#176;C for 2 min, 94&#176;C for 30 s, x for y, 72&#176;C for 1 min and 72&#176;C for 10 min). The PCR program for the Phusion<sup>&#174;</sup> polymerase was performed for 35 cycles (98&#176;C for 30 s, 98&#176;C for 10 s, x for 30 s, 72&#176;C for 90 s, 72&#176;C for 10 min).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>Mutagenesis was performed using the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol of the &#8220;Quick and Easy Gene Deletion Kit&#8221; (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany). An antibiotic cassette was introduced via homologous recombination, which was established for <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 in our lab. The method depends on a Red/ET system (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>) where two helper plasmids (pRed/ET and pFRT) were used for generating single mutants, and an additional plasmid (Flpe-708) was used to produce double mutants. For the gene disruption, primers of 71&#8211;73 nucleotides were used (Supplementary Table S3). They consisted of 50 nucleotides homologous to the gene and 21&#8211;23 nucleotides homologous to the helper plasmid pFRT, which contained a resistance cassette. The 50 nucleotides flanked the FRT-PGK-gb2-neo-FRT cassette at each site of the kanamycin resistance. This 1700 bp DNA construct was obtained by high fidelity PCR, eluted from the gel (NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up; Macherey-Nagel, D&#252;ren, Germany), and then integrated into the target gene. The helper plasmid pRed/ET was required to integrate the functional cassette by homologous recombination. The plasmid DNA was introduced via electroporation into competent cells of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13. The mutants were verified by using specific primer combinations that showed the presence of the functional cassette (FRT primer) as well the exact integration site (FRT primer and gene-specific primer) in the gene.</p><p>The electroporation: competent cells were mixed with 1 to 2 &#956;l DNA incubated for 20 min on ice together with a control (without DNA) and transferred into sterile cuvettes (electrode distance 0.2 cm, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). For introducing the extrinsic DNA (resistance cassette) into competent cells high voltage (pulse control 200 &#937;, capacity 25 &#956;F and voltage of 2500 V) was applied with the Gene Pulser II (Bio Rad, Munich, Germany) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dower et al., 1988</xref>). Immediately after the pulse pre-warmed SOC-Medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl +1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 1 M glucose, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added and solution was transferred into test tubes (incubation at 37&#176;C for 4 h, at 170 rpm). Cells were harvested (11.000 g, 1 min) and aliquots of the mixture were plated onto solid medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 &#956;g/ml, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Plates were incubated for at least 2 days at 37&#176;C and colonies were analyzed by PCR for the introduced resistance cassette. Subsequently the VOC profile was monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid-Assisted Complementation of Mutants</title><p>The gene function of the mutants was restored through the introduction of a plasmid containing the wild type gene. This wild type gene was amplified by PCR (Phusion<sup>&#174;</sup> Polymerase; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), restriction sites of <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI were added, and subcloned into the vector pJET (CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The modified pJET plasmid was introduced into chemically competent cells of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> XL-1 Blue. The presence of modified pJET was verified in cells grown on agar supplemented with ampicillin (100 &#956;g/ml). Using gene-specific primers a PCR product was obtained and sequenced (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). The modified pJET and the vector pUC19 were digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the gene fragment from pJET was ligated into the pUC19 vector (own stock; Department of Biochemistry, University of Rostock, Germany). Different promoters were used: (i) <italic>E. coli lac</italic> promoter of the plasmid pUC19, (ii) <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 gapDH promoter corresponding to 500 bp upstream of the <italic>gapdh</italic> gene (in frame), and (iii) <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 promoter corresponding to 500 bp upstream of the gene <italic>SOD_c20780</italic> (in frame). The modified pUC19 vector was inserted into electrocompetent cells of the mutant, and positive clones were selected on ampicillin agar plates. The correct insertion of the construct (gene + promoter) was checked by PCR. Afterward the VOC profiles of two independent clones were monitored over 72 h.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Isolation</title><p>Colonies of the isolates 4Rx13 and AS9 were inoculated for 24 h in 6 ml minimal medium supplemented with 55 mM succinate (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 30&#176;C and 170 rpm.

One culture was harvested after 24 h and another after 48 h (5000 &#215; <italic>g</italic> and 4&#176;C for 20 min). The sediment was treated with the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Machery-Nagel, D&#252;ren, Germany) to isolate total RNA.

The whole genome of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> HRO-C48 was sequenced with the Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The library was sequenced in a 112 bp paired-end single-indexed run, resulting in 9.5 and 7.6 mio paired-end reads, respectively. All shotgun reads were assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using the software Ray (v1.1.0; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert et al., 2010</xref>). The draft genome of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> HRO-C48 consisted of 62 contigs (&gt;500 bp) with a genome size of 5.4 Mb. The open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted with the software Glimmer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Delcher et al., 1999</xref>). Gene annotation was performed automatically by transferring the existing annotations of the reference genome of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13. To identify putative orthologous genes, bidirectional BLAST analysis was used to compare the encoded protein sequences of seven whole genome protein datasets for the following <italic>Serratia</italic> species: CP007439.1 <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> V4, CP002773.1 <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> AS9, LFJS01000012.1 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> DB11, NC_009832.1 <italic>S. proteomaculans</italic> 568, NZ_GG753567.1 <italic>S. odorifera</italic> DSMZ 4582, NZ_AJB000088.1 <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> PRI-2C, and NC_021591.1 <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13.

The latter one was used for final refinements and docking of the product sodorifen into the active site. Since the template structure was co-crystallized with the ligand dihydrofarnesyl pyrophosphate, this information was automatically transferred into the homology model of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> by YASARA. The ligand, however, was manually modified to farnesyl pyrophosphate using the molecular modeling environment program MOE 2014.09<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup> and was subsequently optimized in the active site pocket using fixed coordinates of the protein.

(2014)</xref>, resulting in the identification of 246 unique ORFs. Among these unique ORFs, 138 genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins, which were of particular interest as they could potentially be involved in the biosynthesis of the structurally unusual compound sodorifen. To further narrow down the number of candidate genes, an additional sodorifen producer isolate, HRO-C48 was sequenced to find common genes with the genome of the isolate 4Rx13 that may be involved in the biosynthesis of sodorifen (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). Another recently sequenced sodorifen producer, isolate <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> V4 (CP007439.1) was also included into the genome comparison (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cleto et al., 2014</xref>). An overview of shared and unique genes was obtained by bidirectional Biblast, and results were visualized using the DNAplotter (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Carver et al., 2009</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>). <italic>S. plymuthica</italic>, the sodorifen producer isolates and the non-producer AS9 shared high overall sequence identities, while the <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> PRI-2C as well as <italic>S. proteamaculans</italic> and <italic>S. odorifera</italic> were less similar (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the non-producer <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> AS9 had 2901 ORFs in common with isolate 4Rx13, which was in the same range as the sodorifen producing isolates HRO-C48 and V4. Less common ORFs were found with the non-producers <italic>S. proteamaculans</italic> 568, <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> PRI-2C, and <italic>S. odorifera</italic> DSM 4582. Remarkable is that although belonging to the same species, the isolate <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> PRI-2C differed significantly from <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13. For the search of candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis genomes of the sodorifen producers and the non-producer were analyzed. AS9 was included because of its high sequence similarity to 4Rx13 (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref></bold>). This search identified two genes (<italic>SOD_c13130</italic> and <italic>SOD_c44800</italic>), which were analyzed via knockout mutation. The VOC profiles of these two mutants were unchanged compared to the wild type, most notably both mutants emitted sodorifen in high quantities (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref></bold>). Therefore this approach failed to identify candidate genes for the sodorifen biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome Analysis of <italic>Serratia plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 and AS9</title><p>An alternative approach to find candidate genes involved in the sodorifen biosynthesis is the comparison of transcriptomes of the sodorifen producer <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 and the closely related non-producer <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> AS9. The isolates 4Rx13 and AS9 were cultivated in a minimal medium supplemented with succinate, which was previously shown to yield very high sodorifen emissions (Weise and Piechulla unpublished). It was hypothesized that under these growth conditions genes involved in the biosynthesis of sodorifen are highly expressed allowing a distinction from housekeeping genes. Total RNA was isolated after 24 h (low sodorifen emissions) and 48 h (high sodorifen emissions) of growth of the 4Rx13 and AS9 isolates, subsequently sequenced and visualized using the TraV software tool (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 2014</xref>) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). The transcription level (NPKM) of a gene to be considered as a candidate gene for sodorifen biosynthesis should be significantly higher in <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 compared to the non-producer <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> AS9. In total, 20 genes were identified that met the proposed criterium. The identified genes were involved in different metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism (three genes), stress response (four genes), nucleotide metabolism (one gene), isoprenoid metabolism (two genes), membrane modulation (one gene), and included nine hypothetical proteins (violet) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>). Twelve genes have been knocked out and respective mutants were analyzed regarding their VOC profiles (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>). High priority was given to (i) genes of the terpenoid metabolism because many natural products are terpenes, and (ii) to hypothetical proteins because a new biosynthetic pathway was expected to be involved in the synthesis of this unsual compound. Genes of the category stress, nucleotide metabolism and membrane protein were not highly likely candidate genes/proteins and were so far not analyzed. All except one mutant exhibited the wild type phenotype and produced sodorifen (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref></bold>). The exception was gene <italic>SOD_c20750</italic>, a putative terpene cyclase. This gene was highly expressed in <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 (NPKM after 48 h = 1357) but not transcribed in <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> AS9 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>) and the knockout mutant of <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> emitted no sodorifen but a new compound appeared in its VOC profile (#4 in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>). The stability of the mutation was investigated by PCR and the presence of the resistance cassette was checked over 72 h (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref></bold>).

This annotation is most likely due to the presence of the characteristic motif DDXXD, which is always found in terpene synthase sequences. Presently 63 bacterial terpene synthases are known (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>), which possess four conserved motifs or amino acid residues, the aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) (located around amino acid 80), the amino acid arginine (around 175&#8211;185), and arginine and tyrosine (ca. 310), and the NSE/DTE motif (ca. 220) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>).

Although the biochemical characterization of <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> remains to be done, here it was shown for the first time that this gene is indispensable for the synthesis of sodorifen and strongly supports that sodorifen descends from the terpene metabolism.

However, the underlying biosynthetic pathway was still unknown. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis of sodorifen producer and non-producer isolates generated a list of candidate genes, which might be involved in sodorifen biosynthesis. Knockout mutagenesis was applied, but many mutants continued to emit sodorifen, except the knockout of the gene <italic>SOD_c20750</italic>, which revealed a sodorifen-negative phenotype. For the first time a gene was identified that was involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual natural product sodorifen, which is only synthesized by three <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> isolates.</p><p>For the elucidation of sodorifen biosynthesis of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> a multilayered approach was performed. The proteome of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 emitting sodorifen when grown in a complex medium was compared to the proteome under non-emission conditions (grown in NB medium supplemented with glucose), but no distinct sodorifen biosynthesis enzymes could be identified (Domik and Piechulla, unpublished results). In this publication we described a genome comparison of sodorifen producer and non-producer <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> isolates, but again did not find a gene involved in sodorifen biosynthesis. Only the transcriptome analysis led to successful identification of at least one gene being involved in the biosynthesis of sodorifen, the terpene cyclase gene <italic>SOD_c20750</italic>. As this gene is also present in the non-producer isolate AS9 it became clear why the genomic approach could not be effective for the search of candidate genes. Apparently a transcriptome analysis is a more straightforward approach, because not only silenced and repressed genes but also truncated and pseudogenes are eliminated from the pool of candidate genes. Since the transcriptome analysis indicated low transcript levels of the terpene cyclase gene we concluded that the transcription is repressed or not initiated rather than the expression of insufficient gene products. Ca. 450 nucleotides of the putative promoter regions were compared in the genomes of 4Rx13 and AS9 and several nucleotide differences or deletions were found which might be responsible for different transcription activities. To verify this hypothesis future experiments will include determination of the transcription start point and promoter exchange studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Verification of <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> Involved in the Biosynthesis of Sodorifen</title><p>The knockout mutant of <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> was only successfully restored when the recombinant plasmid contained the wild type terpene cyclase gene and the native promotor of the wild type. This restoration approach has previously been used in archaea, bacteria and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shanley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Minet et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). The complementation of the terpene cyclase mutant of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> was not straight forward. In a first attempt, the wild type gene was cloned into the vector pUC19, which harbored the <italic>lac</italic> promoter of <italic>E. coli.</italic> However, the mutant remained unable to produce sodorifen. It was speculated that the transcription system of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> was not able to recognize the promoter of <italic>E. coli</italic>, due to the different genetic background and variations of consensus sequences. Therefore, the native <italic>gapdh</italic> promoter was used in a second approach. However, this experiment still resulted in a sodorifen-negative phenotype. In a third attempt a promoter was selected, which was highly expressed in the transcriptome analysis. The putative promoter corresponding to the 500 bp upstream region of the gene <italic>SOD_c20780</italic> was selected. This approach led to a successful complementation of the mutant, resulting in the recovery of sodorifen emission. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of a complementation in <italic>S. plymuthica</italic>. However, the sodorifen emission was low, only less than 1% of the wild type emission level was measured. Several reasons might be responsible for the low recovery rate: (i) not much is known about plasmid gene expression in <italic>Serratia</italic> in general, for example the efficiency of plasmid expression might be much lower in <italic>Serratia</italic> compared to <italic>E. coli</italic>. Subsequently only low transcript levels will appear. (ii) It is very likely that other genes are involved in the biosynthesis of sodorifen, which are localized on the bacterial genome. After complementation the plasmid and genome transcription activity might not be well synchronized. (iii) The precise length of the promoter and its <italic>cis</italic> factors are presently not known, e.g., enhancer sequences might be missing. (iv) In the complementation construct in frame cloning was ensured and the promoter was directly fused to the reintroduced terpene cyclase gene, while ca. 3000 nucleotides are between the terpene cyclase and the promoter of SOD_c20780 in the wild type. In fact the terpene cyclase clusters together with three other genes, which are co-transcribed (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Domik et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the Terpene Cyclase of <italic>Serratia plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13</title><p>The gene <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> was annotated as a terpene cyclase. While a wealth of knowledge concerning terpene cyclases of plants is available (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), only little is known about terpene cyclases in bacteria. It is a difficult task to find bacterial terpene synthases via blast analysis, as only low levels of sequence similarities exist between bacterial terpene synthases. <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al. (2015)</xref> applied a novel genome mining strategy and were able to identify 262 bacterial terpene synthases hiding in the database. Till now, 63 terpene synthases from bacteria were functionally verified (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). The majority of terpene synthases associate with microorganisms belong to Actinomycetales and only a minor fraction of Gram-negative bacteria, cyanobacteria, and myxobacteria, harbor terpene synthases (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). Here we present the first terpene cyclase found in a <italic>Serratia</italic> species. Beside the methylisoborneol synthase of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> PfO-1 it is the second terpene synthase found in Gammaproteobacteria and the first in Enterobacteriales.</p><p>Terpene cyclases are enzymes that catalyze the final step in isoprenoid formation. They usually use geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranyl&#8211;geranyl pyrophosphate as substrates, which are produced from the C5 precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These C5 building blocks are generated via the DOXP/MEP or mevalonate pathway depending which pathway is present in the bacterium (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rohdich et al., 2001</xref>). Since at least one DOXP gene (<italic>SOD_c20770</italic>, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>) was found in the genome of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 we assume that the precursors of the sodorifen biosynthesis result from the DOXP pathway.</p><p>Although the catalytic reaction mechanism of many plant terpene synthases are known and even crystal structures exist (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aaron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">K&#246;ksal et al., 2012</xref>), it is difficult to predict the correct native 3D structure of terpene cyclases or predict the product(s) just on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rabe and Dickschat, 2013</xref>). According to <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat (2016)</xref> eight diterpene synthases and 46 sesquiterpene synthases of bacteria are presently known. The crystal structures of the pentalenene synthase, epi-isozizaene synthase, selinadiene synthase, hedycaryol synthase, and 2-methylisoborneol synthase were elucidated so far. Since the molecular formula of sodorifen is C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>26</sub> either a sesquiterpene synthase or a diterpene synthase might be required for its synthesis, but neither the native structure or the exact mechanism of action of the terpene cyclase of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 is presently known, and consequently no putative biosynthesis reactions can be proposed resulting in the polymethylated bicyclic structure of sodorifen (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Homology modeling was used to create a model of the tertiary structure based on a X-ray structure of a selinadiene synthase from <italic>Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</italic> (pdb-code 4OKZ) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). Indicated by the co-crystallized dihydrofarnesyl pyrophosphate in the active site of the template the corresponding active site of the <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 terpene cyclase could be detected (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>). The diphosphate moiety is recognized by three divalent magnesium cations bound to D102, D103, D107, and E252. These residues correspond to D82, D83, E87, and E232 in other bacterial enzymes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, R331 is most likely involved in the diphosphate binding and superimposed with R310 in the template. Y332 may function as proton acceptor in a proton relay with the diphosphate when cleaved off to finalize the reaction cascade. The binding site of the farnesyl moiety is also highly conserved. Hydrophobic amino acid residues in the active sites of both proteins (of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> and <italic>S. pristinaespiralis</italic>) spatially superpose very well: I74 (in 4OKZ = F55), A95 (I75), A98 (L78), F99 (F79), F207 (V187), V240 (I220), and W325 (W304). However, these differences in sequences lead to different folding and may require intermediate reaction steps of the farnesyl moiety to form the product sodorifen. In contrast, both enzymes have in common that after cleavage of the diphosphate moiety, the cation may be stabilized by the side chain of tryptophane W325 (W354), followed by a first cyclization reaction, which most likely is realized by an attack of the C1-carbon atom to the terminal dimethyl allyl group. Further reaction cascades would include other cyclization reactions and methyl shifts, which are at present highly speculative. Docking studies of the product sodorifen (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>) revealed the most favored docking position in the active site and clearly indicates that the structure of the active pocket may be sufficient that this compound can indeed be formed by this enzyme. There are almost perfect spatial interactions of this hydrophobic product with many of the hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the active site. These interactions and the special shape of the active site may guide and support the product formation.</p><p>A possibility to analyze the products of terpene cyclases is by heterologous expression in the genetically engineered bacterium <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2013</xref>). It was shown that the heterologous expression of the silent biosynthetic cluster in <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> resulted in the production of 11 new diterpenes and two new sesquiterpenes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S. clavuligerus</italic> and <italic>S. lactacystinaeus</italic>, which are terpene non-producers under natural conditions, showed the expression of terpene synthases in the engineered <italic>S. avermitilis</italic>. Thus, to unravel the function of <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> in the biosynthesis of sodorifen such approach has to be undertaken in the future. However, it has to be considered that (i) it is likely that not only a single gene might be sufficient to produce such a structurally unusual compound as sodorifen and (ii) the accepted substrate [isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), methyl-GPP, neryl diphosphate (NPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranyl&#8211;geranyl diphosphate (GGPP), <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>] has to be determined. Product formation will also indicate whether the enzyme encoded by <italic>SOD_c20750</italic> is a single-or multi-product enzyme. Therefore, heterologous overexpression, purification, and biochemical characterization will be crucial for providing information about the function of the <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> terpene cyclase. The location of the active pocket and the involvement of amino acid residues that are responsible for the reaction mechanism could then be targeted using site-directed mutagenesis to investigate whether changes in single amino acids lead to novel compounds.</p><p>Bacterial terpene cyclases have no significant amino acid sequence identities to plant enzymes. Compared to typical plant terpene synthases bacterial terpene cyclases are approximately 150 amino acids shorter. Plant terpene synthases typically encompass seven conserved motifs, the RR(X)<sub>8</sub>W, RWW, RDR, NALV, DDXXD, NSE, and CYMNE motif (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">F&#228;hnrich et al., 2014</xref>). Most prominent are the conserved DDXXD and the NSE/DTE motifs, which are involved in binding of cations (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), which are required for the cyclization reaction of the acyclic terpene precursor (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cane and Ikeda, 2012</xref>). The distance of ca. 140 amino acids between the DDXXD and NSE/DTE sequence is conserved in plant and bacterial terpene cyclases (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cane and Ikeda, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). Both motifs can also be found in bacterial sequences as well as conserved amino acid residues (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). The terpene cyclase of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 contained a slightly different DDXXXDE motif, but does not contain the NSE/DTE motif (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dickschat, 2016</xref>). It is possible that the sequence (NDRYAVAMR) at position 138 is (functionally) equivalent in the isolate 4Rx13, however, this remains to be proven. Alternatively, it is also possible that the terpene cyclase of <italic>S. plymuthica</italic> 4Rx13 belongs to the class II enzymes, which only possess the DDXX(D/E) motif and achieve initial carbocation formation by substrate protonation rather than by substrate ionization (class I) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Meguro et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another structural feature was observed in the bacterial terpene cyclase. The comparison (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>) showed that most of the N-terminal part of a typical plant enzymes is missing in the bacterial enzymes. While the C-terminal part of the plant terpene cyclases are responsible for the catalytic activity, the function of N-terminal part remains elusive (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aaron et al., 2010</xref>) and therefore it is intriguing to speculate why the bacterial terpene synthase enzymes lost the N-terminal part or alternatively, why the plant enzyme gained additional sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AT and RD performed the transcriptome experiment, TW established the knockout mutagenesis for <italic>Serratia</italic>, DD performed all other experiments, WB did the 3D modeling, DD and BP wrote the manuscript; all authors interpreted the results and approved the submitted version of the paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Universities of Rostock and G&#246;ttingen and the DFG for financial support.
