African&#8211;American and Hispanic women represent a disproportionate percentage of the disease burden, constituting &lt;25% of all US women, but accounting for 79% of new diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref></sup> Despite the changing epidemiology of HIV among women, they remain under-represented in most clinical HIV studies as few women enrol and continue in trials in the developed world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C5">5</xref></sup> Much of the data available on women with HIV are from studies carried out in resource-limited settings. In addition, as most clinical studies have enrolled fewer women than men, treatment guidelines are based primarily on outcomes in men.</p><p>Recent studies highlight that despite initial concerns regarding potential differences in response to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy across gender, both men and women respond equally well to therapy. Differences in response typically occur due to a higher number of discontinuations among women as compared with men. When efficacy results are censored for discontinuations other than virological failure, women have responded as well as men in several clinical trials in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C9">9</xref></sup> The reasons for the high number of discontinuations among women in HIV clinical trials are not known. Even though there do not appear to be significant differences in efficacy by sex, gender differences in toxicity and adverse reactions have been detected, despite the fact that no major study in treatment-naive patients has been designed or powered to detect gender differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C13">13</xref></sup> As there are several issues that women must consider when incorporating a complex ARV regimen into their lives (including contraception, childbearing, breastfeeding and the potential for mother-to-child HIV transmission), it is imperative to define potential side effects that may affect the choice of treatment regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C14">14</xref></sup> HIV stigma and access to care may also affect outcomes for HIV-infected women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C15">15</xref></sup> For many women, fitting modern regimens and clinic visits into their busy schedules can be a challenge. Therefore, tailoring ARV treatment regimens to gender may optimize response, tolerability and adherence, and minimize toxicity.</p><p>Analyses from the open-label, international CASTLE study provide much-needed data on the efficacy and tolerability of protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in female and male patients. Findings from a 48 week analysis, reported at the Seventeenth International AIDS Conference (2008), demonstrated that treatment-naive women receiving atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir (both in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine) experienced a greater number of treatment-related adverse events and slightly lower virological response than males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C8">8</xref></sup> These data are consistent with the gender-based differences previously noted; however, these analyses were not preplanned or powered to identify differences in efficacy and safety. We report here results from an analysis assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine in female and male patients enrolled in the CASTLE study through 96 weeks of treatment. In the overall CASTLE population, atazanavir/ritonavir was shown to be non-inferior to, with higher virological response rates than, lopinavir/ritonavir through 96 weeks of treatment. The difference in response rates in favour of atazanavir/ritonavir at 96 weeks was driven by a higher rate of discontinuation among patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. This was accompanied, in the overall population, by significantly less lipid elevation and better gastrointestinal tolerability in the atazanavir/ritonavir group than in the lopinavir/ritonavir group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C17">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Details of the study design and participants were described previously by Molina <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C17">17</xref></sup> Briefly, patients were eligible for enrolment if they were infected with HIV-1, were aged &#8805;18 years, were naive to ARV therapy (&lt;1 week previous ARV experience or &lt;6 weeks exposure for prophylaxis or prevention of mother-to-child transmission) and had HIV-1 RNA &#8805;5000 copies/mL.

These findings are consistent with the overall results for the CASTLE study in which the difference in response between treatment arms in the ITT analysis at 96 weeks was driven by a similar virological response rate with a higher rate of discontinuation among patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C17">17</xref></sup> In this analysis, the difference in virological response observed between genders in the ITT analysis at 96 weeks may have been due to the higher rate of discontinuation among women than among men in each treatment arm. Similar differences in response to once- or twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir and tenofovir/emtricitabine between men and women have been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C25">25</xref></sup> while other studies have found no gender-related differences in response rates to fosamprenavir/ritonavir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C26">26</xref></sup> and darunavir/ritonavir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C27">27</xref></sup> in treatment-naive patients or combination ARV regimens in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C28">28</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, a greater proportion of women than men discontinued the study before week 96 in both treatment groups, a trend that has also been observed in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C9">9</xref></sup> This difference in the rate of discontinuation was partly driven by pregnancy (4%&#8211;5%) among women in both treatment groups. In addition, more women (6%) than men (3%) discontinued due to suboptimal adherence in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm. Whether the difference in compliance between women in the two treatment arms and between women and men is related to the higher rate of gastrointestinal side effects with lopinavir/ritonavir is unknown. There are several factors that may influence women's compliance with HIV regimens, including busy daily schedules, childcare responsibilities, social relationships, emotional well-being and therapy-induced changes in body appearance, such as weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C29">29</xref></sup></p><p>It is not known why women discontinue clinical trials more frequently than men. The Gender, Race and Clinical Experience (GRACE) study, which assessed darunavir/ritonavir (plus investigator-selected background regimens) in 287 and 142 treatment-experienced HIV-infected men and women, respectively, found a similar trend. At 48 weeks there was a higher-than-expected rate of discontinuation due to loss of follow-up, relocation and withdrawal of consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C5">5</xref></sup> Although the numbers of women in clinical trials is increasing, their numbers remain low at only 20% in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG5142) study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C30">30</xref></sup> 22% in the KLEAN study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C21">21</xref></sup> 30% in the ARTEMIS study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C22">22</xref></sup> and 31% in the CASTLE study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C16">16</xref></sup></p><p>There are several factors exclusive to women that may influence the decision to enrol in, or continue to participate in, a clinical study. Women of childbearing potential need to consider what contraception they would use when participating in clinical studies as few ARV drugs are indicated for concomitant use with contraceptive drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C31">31</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C33">33</xref></sup> Several PIs may increase or decrease the levels of contraceptives and may result in adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C14">14</xref></sup> The potential teratogenic risk if pregnancy should occur may also deter women from enrolling or continuing in clinical studies. Nonetheless, for HIV-infected women who want to become pregnant, ARV therapy can reduce the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C14">14</xref></sup> HIV-infected women are also more likely to have financial problems or experience discrimination than HIV-infected men and this may influence a woman's willingness to participate in a clinical study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKQ457C34">34</xref></sup> However, most of these data are obtained from studies carried out in the developing world. Until more women from the developed world participate in clinical studies, the reasons for fewer enrolments and more discontinuations among women than among men will not be fully understood.</p><p>Limitations of the study include its open-label design, and the fact that it was not specifically designed or powered to investigate the influence of gender on outcomes. A larger number of female patients would enable more meaningful comparisons between the two treatment groups.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study show that atazanavir/ritonavir is an effective once-daily boosted PI regimen that in combination with other ARVs is well tolerated and appropriate for use in HIV-infected women and men. The lower response rates observed in women than in men may have been due to higher discontinuation rates in women in both treatment arms, suggesting the need for additional research to understand the reasons why women are less likely to complete clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by <funding-source>Bristol-Myers Squibb</funding-source>.
