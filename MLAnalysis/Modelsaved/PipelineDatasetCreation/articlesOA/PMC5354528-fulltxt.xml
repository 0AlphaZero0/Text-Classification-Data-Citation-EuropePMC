This is the first-in-human study aimed at evaluating the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of DA-8031 and its metabolites (M1, M2, M4, and M5) in the plasma and urine after administration of a single oral dose in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A dose block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study was conducted. Subjects received either placebo or a single dose of DA-8031 at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 120 mg. DA-8031 and its four metabolites were analyzed in the plasma and urine for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The effect of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome-P450 (CYP) enzymes on the pharmacokinetics of DA-8031 was evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After a single dose, plasma DA-8031 reached the maximum concentration at a median of 2&#8211;3 h and was eliminated with terminal elimination half-life of 17.9&#8211;28.7 h. The mean renal clearance was 3.7&#8211;5.6 L/h. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics was observed over the dose range of 20&#8211;80 mg. Among the metabolites, M4 had the greatest plasma concentration, followed by M5 and M1. Subjects with CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer had significantly greater dose-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#8211;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> of DA-8031 as well as smaller metabolic ratios than those subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and headache, and no serious adverse events were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the systemic exposure of DA-8031 was increased proportionally to the dose within 20&#8211;80 mg. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 had an effect on the systemic exposure of DA-8031. DA-8031 was well tolerated after single doses of 80 mg or less.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DA-8031</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</kwd><kwd>premature ejaculation</kwd><kwd>first-in-human</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Approximately 20%&#8211;30% of men complained of PE, and 76.9% of males with typical erectile function reported various degrees of PE.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Psychological issues and neurogenic conditions have been suggested as etiological factors of PE.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Anxiety or conditioning toward rapid ejaculation was attributed to psychological causes, and either hyposensitivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT<sub>2c</sub>) receptors or hypersensitivity of the 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptors was associated with the neurogenic etiology.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are capable of increasing the activity of serotonergic cells in the nucleus paragigantocellularis, thereby inhibiting the expulsion phase of ejaculation by modulating bulbospongiosus muscle activity and impairing the emission phase by blocking the rise in seminal vesicular pressure.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Although several SSRIs have been used off-label (especially dapoxetine, which was approved for on-demand treatment of PE), on-demand SSRI therapies have limited effects because of their pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic characteristics.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, daily SSRIs are expected to be the first choice of treatment in patients with primary PE.<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Because daily SSRI medication may cause priapism, loss of bone mineral density, QTc interval prolongation, reduced libido and erectile dysfunction, as well as the short-term adverse effects of excess yawning, nausea, sweating, fatigue, and diarrhea due to the serotonin subreceptor selectivity and interaction with other neurotransmitter receptors, a novel daily SSRI with high tolerability and that is effective against PE is still required.<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>DA-8031 is a potent SSRI under clinical investigation for the treatment of PE.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> From preclinical studies, DA-8031 was shown to have a high selectivity and specificity for serotonin transporters compared with other monoamine transporters and to increase ejaculation latency time without altering the post-ejaculatory interval.<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Furthermore, DA-8031 had a low affinity to other receptors, and thus it could contribute to fewer adverse effects.<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Regarding the pharmacokinetics of DA-8031, &lt;1% of DA-8031 was excreted in urine, feces, or bile in its unchanged chemical structure, and bioavailability was greater in the high-dose groups in the preclinical study (investigator&#8217;s brochure, unpublished data on file).

CYP2C8 was excluded from the analysis, because all subjects had the same genotype (wild-type).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>The 63 drug-related AEs occurred in 27 subjects (54 in 21 DA-8031 subjects and 9 in 6 placebo subjects). All AEs were of mild or moderate severity, and the moderate AEs were 1 case of eye pain and 4 cases of nausea in the highest (120 mg) dosage group. The most frequent drug-related AE associated with DA-8031 was nausea (11 cases) followed by decreased orthostatic blood pressure (9 cases). The frequency and intensity of AEs considered to be DA-8031 related increased according to the administered dose. None of the subjects either developed any serious AEs or discontinued the study due to an AE.</p><p>Regarding vital signs and orthostatic blood pressure, a decrease of systolic blood pressure (&gt;20 mmHg) or a decrease of diastolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) was observed in 15 of 71 subjects. The frequency was not significantly different among the placebo and multiple DA-8031 dose groups, and no accompanying symptoms were reported.</p><p>Prolonged QTcB and QTcF intervals longer than 450 ms were observed in the groups receiving a 60 mg dose or higher. The frequency of QTc prolongation was highest in the 120 mg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-11-713">Table 3</xref>), and the mean QTcB<sub>max</sub> and QTcF<sub>max</sub> were longer than 450 ms in the 120 mg dose group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-11-713">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-11-713">Figure 3</xref>). The maximum changes in both the QTcB and QTcF from baseline (predose) were significantly different between the 120 mg dose of DA-8031 and placebo (QTcB interval: <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; QTcF interval: <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-11-713">Table 3</xref>). The 90% CI of the difference between DA-8031 and placebo was 21&#8211;55 ms for the maximum change in QTcB and 16&#8211;60 ms for the maximum change in QTcF. These differences were significant according to the dose groups, but genetic variation of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 had little effect on QTc changes between DA-8031 and placebo.</p><p>Considering the possibility of the QTc interval overestimating and inaccurately detecting a terminal T-wave based on the automated 12-lead ECG Analysis Program, most of the case of prolonged QTc over 450 ms in the dose range of 60&#8211;80 mg were clinically insignificant after review of the ECG findings by two independent cardiologists. As a result, QTc prolongation was thought to be a concerning issue only when 120 mg DA-8031 was administered.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this first-in-human clinical study, the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of single ascending dose of DA-8031 up to 120 mg were provided. DA-8031 was rapidly absorbed at a median time of 2&#8211;3 h and eliminated with a mean terminal <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 17.9&#8211;28.7 h, both of which are suitable for a once-daily regimen.</p><p>After single oral administration of DA-8031, the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#8211;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> for plasma DA-8031 levels increased in dose-proportional manner within the range of 20&#8211;80 mg. When a 120 mg dose of DA-8031 was administered, the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#8211;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> increased supra-proportionally, and the CL/F was reduced compared to lower doses. Since CL<sub>R</sub> was similar over the entire range of doses, the increased exposure of 120 mg of DA-8031 was presumably due to the reduced hepatic clearance by the saturation of enzyme capacity.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were involved in the metabolism of DA-8031 and can exert influence on the individual systemic exposure of SSRIs.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms also could affect the risk profile for side effects and the overall efficacy of the medication via PK variability of the parent drug and its active metabolites.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the studies with human cDNA-expressed CYPs, DA-8031 was primarily metabolized by CYP enzymes. After oral administration, DA-8031 was directly metabolized to M4 and M1 followed by M5, which is formed from M4 and M1 (investigator&#8217;s brochure, unpublished data on file). CYP2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 played a role in the production of M4 and M1, and CYP2D6 was involved in the formation of M5 (investigator&#8217;s brochure, unpublished data on file). In addition, the formation of M1 and M4 was mainly inhibited under the presence of the CYP2C8 antibody and the CYP2D6 antibody, respectively (investigator&#8217;s brochure, unpublished data on file). In the present study, the metabolic parameters were significantly different according to the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes. The differences in the exposure of the parent drug DA-8031 and the MRs for all metabolites (M1, M4, and M5) were observed in the two CYP2D6 genotypes (EM and IM). The subjects with CYP2D6 EM had lower <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#8211;</sub><italic><sub>t</sub></italic> values, higher MRs, and a shorter <italic>t</italic><sub>1&#8260;2</sub> than the subjects with CYP2D6 IM. On the other hand, the CYP2C19 genotype had a limited effect on the metabolism of M1, which is a minor metabolite. These results suggest that the genetic variability of CYP2D6 could have an effect on the PK variability of DA-8031, leading to possible variations in the frequencies in AE occurrences and which would ultimately have an effect on optimized treatment based on different systemic exposure to DA-8031.<xref rid="b19-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Regarding safety and tolerability, DA-8031 was well tolerated up to 80 mg; the most commonly reported AEs were nausea, dizziness, headache, or prolonged QT based on an ECG. These findings were consistent with previous reports that AEs during SSRI therapy were dose dependent and that profiles of AEs such as nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness were caused by serotonergic effects.<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> With respect to QTc prolongation, although SSRIs are not generally regarded as QTc-prolonging agents, occasional cases of QTc prolongation with SSRI and even fatal cardiotoxicities such as torsade de pointes have been reported.<xref rid="b22-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In a preclinical study, a high dose of DA-8031 induced <italic>hERG</italic> current inhibition and QT prolongation. The QTc interval, which was longer than 450 ms, was associated with the development of a dangerous arrhythmia.<xref rid="b23-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our results, QTc intervals longer than 450 ms were prominently observed in groups receiving a 120 mg dose. The QTc interval after administration of DA-8031 was prolonged proportionally to the systemic exposure of DA-8031 rather than its metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-11-713">Figure 3</xref>), but influence according to the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes on the QTc prolongation were not significant. Because QTc prolongation could be influenced by lipophilicity or bulkiness of the molecular structure due to varying degrees of potassium channel-blocking activity, the polar metabolites might have a reduced effect on the QTc interval.<xref rid="b24-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Prolonged QTc associated with SSRI is known to be relatively small and clinically insignificant in patients with no other risk factors such as old age, female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Moreover, the pharmacologically active dose for DA-8031 was expected to be 20&#8211;40 mg in humans (investigator&#8217;s brochure, unpublished data on file). Based on these results, the influence of DA-8031 on QTc prolongation would be limited in expected active dose ranges.<xref rid="b25-dddt-11-713" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of DA-8031 as a new SSRI for the treatment of PE in humans. After a single oral dose, DA-8031 was rapidly absorbed and eliminated by first-order kinetics. PK linearity was suggested within the dose range of 20&#8211;80 mg. CYP2D6 was presumed to be involved in the metabolism of DA-8031, and polymorphisms of CYP2D6 had an effect on the systemic exposure and the MR of DA-8031. Single oral administration of DA-8031 was well tolerated up to 80 mg. DA-8031 doses of 120 mg may cause QTc prolongation, which should be considered in the design of further studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of DA-8031 in PE patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-dddt-11-713"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Relationship of the time&#8211;plasma concentration profiles between DA-8031 and its four metabolites after a single oral dose of DA-8031 at (<bold>A</bold>) 5 mg, (<bold>B</bold>) 10 mg, (<bold>C</bold>) 20 mg, (<bold>D</bold>) 40 mg, (<bold>E</bold>) 60 mg, (<bold>F</bold>) 80 mg, and (<bold>G</bold>) 120 mg.</p><p><bold>Note:</bold> Bars represent standard deviations.</p></caption><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="dddt-11-713s1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e776" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="dddt-11-713s1a.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e777" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Dong-A ST, Seoul, Korea.
