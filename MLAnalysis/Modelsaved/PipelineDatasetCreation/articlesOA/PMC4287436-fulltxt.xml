The HMG-box protein Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor that is downregulated in response to RTK signaling, thereby enabling RTK-dependent induction of Cic targets. In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, Cic is expressed as two isoforms, long (Cic-L) and short (Cic-S), whose functional significance and mechanism of action are not well understood. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cic relies on the Groucho (Gro) corepressor during its function in the early embryo, but not during other stages of development. This Gro-dependent mechanism requires a short peptide motif, unique to Cic-S and designated N2, which is distinct from other previously defined Gro-interacting motifs and functions as an autonomous, transferable repressor element. Unexpectedly, our data indicate that the N2 motif is an evolutionary innovation that originated within dipteran insects, as the Cic-S isoform evolved from an ancestral Cic-L-type form. Accordingly, the Cic-L isoform lacking the N2 motif is completely inactive in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, indicating that the N2 motif endowed Cic-S with a novel Gro-dependent activity that is obligatory at this stage. We suggest that Cic-S and Gro coregulatory functions have facilitated the evolution of the complex transcriptional network regulated by Torso RTK signaling in modern fly embryos. Notably, our results also imply that mammalian Cic proteins are unlikely to act via Gro and that their Cic-S isoform must have evolved independently of fly Cic-S. Thus, Cic proteins employ distinct repressor mechanisms that are associated with discrete structural changes in the evolutionary history of this protein family.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Understanding the evolution of developmental regulatory mechanisms is a central challenge of biology. Here we uncover a newly evolved mechanism of transcriptional repression by Capicua (Cic), a conserved sensor of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Cic patterns the central regions of the embryo by repressing genes induced by Torso RTK signaling at the poles. We show that Cic performs this function by recruiting the Groucho (Gro) corepressor and that this mechanism is an evolutionary innovation of dipteran insects. Indeed, we find that recruitment of Gro depends on a short motif of Cic (N2) specific to dipterans. Strikingly, moreover, the form of Cic that existed before the origin of dipterans is completely inactive in fly embryos, whereas the equivalent form carrying N2 displays significant function. This suggests that evolution of the N2 motif caused a fundamental change in Cic repressor activity, which we propose has enabled the complex roles of Cic, Gro and Torso signaling in fly embryonic patterning. In contrast, Cic functions independently of Gro in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues and probably also in mammals, where Cic lacks the N2 sequence. Thus, our results illustrate the structural and evolutionary origins of essential functional variations within a highly conserved family of developmental regulators.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by research grants from the Spanish Government (BFU2008-01875 and BFU2011-23611), Generalitat de Catalunya (2009SGR-1075) and Fundaci&#243; La Marat&#243; de TV3 (20131730).

RTKs often signal through the conserved Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade, leading to phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors which then elicit changes in target gene expression.

Indeed, Cic proteins from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals share many functional and structural properties: they repress transcription by binding to related DNA sites in target genes, appear to be similarly downregulated by RTKs and are expressed as two main isoforms, short (Cic-S) and long (Cic-L), which differ in their N-terminal regions <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Astigarraga1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lhr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Ajuria1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Fryer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004902-Dissanayake1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, despite these similarities, it is currently unclear whether all Cic family proteins employ a common mechanism of repression. Studies in mouse and human cells have shown that Cic associates with Ataxin1 (Atxn1), a co-repressor involved in SCA1 <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Fryer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. On the other hand, previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have suggested that Cic functions together with Groucho (Gro) <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jimnez2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Ajuria1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, a WD-repeat co-repressor that associates with multiple repressors, including Hairy/Hes, Nkx, Lef/Tcf and Runx family proteins (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-TurkiJudeh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). However, the functional links between Cic and Gro remain unclear, since no molecular interaction between these proteins has been validated in vivo <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jimnez1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Mannervik1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we investigate the mechanism of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cic repression and its relationship with Gro. We find that Cic functions via Gro in the early embryo but not at other developmental stages. The Gro-assisted mechanism depends on a previously unrecognized motif of Cic (N2), which is essential for recruitment of Gro in vivo. Remarkably, the N2 motif is highly conserved among Cic orthologues in flies and mosquitoes, but is absent in all other species, suggesting that it originated in ancestral dipterans. Furthermore, the N2 domain appears to be a structural innovation associated with the emergence of fly Cic-S isoforms from a pre-existing Cic-L-like isoform. This implies that mammalian Cic proteins, which lack the N2 motif, probably function independently of Gro, and that their Cic-S isoforms must have evolved independently of fly Cic-S. Thus, Cic proteins exhibit context-dependent repressor activities that are partly associated with key structural changes that have occurred during the evolution of this protein family.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Context-dependent activities of Cic in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development</title><p>Cic and Gro are both essential for repression of two terminal gap genes, <italic>tailless</italic> (<italic>tll</italic>) and <italic>huckebein</italic> (<italic>hkb</italic>), in central regions of the blastoderm embryo; this repression is normally relieved by Torso RTK signaling at the embryonic termini, thereby enabling localized induction of <italic>tll</italic> and <italic>hkb</italic> by broadly distributed activators <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jimnez2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Goff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Paroush1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These shared requirements of Cic and Gro in the terminal system have led to the idea that both proteins act in a common repressor complex (see refs. <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jimnez1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Mannervik1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>).

By comparison, other functional attributes of Cic such as their sensitivity to RTK signaling and their binding to specific sites in DNA, are more broadly conserved and therefore probably more ancient. For example, the MAPK-interacting domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cic (C2) is clearly recognizable outside the dipterans <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Astigarraga1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and Cic is downregulated by RTK signaling in mammalian cells <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Fryer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Dissanayake1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, while Cic proteins may have long served as sensors of RTK signaling, their mechanisms of repression appear to have evolved and adapted to fulfill new Cic functions in distinct transcriptional contexts. Below, we discuss the significance and implications of the newly evolved mechanism of Cic repression in fly embryogenesis.</p><p>Our results indicate that prior to the origin of dipterans, Cic was present in insects as a Cic-L-like isoform that lacked the N2 motif. Clearly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cic-L cannot function in the early embryo unless it carries the N2 motif from Cic-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004902-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that evolution of the N2 motif dramatically altered the mechanism of Cic repression by establishing a novel association with Gro. How, then, did the N2 motif appear? The comparison of different insect <italic>cic</italic> genes suggests that the N2 motif originated along with the Cic-S isoform, possibly through genomic rearrangements of intronic <italic>cic-L</italic> sequences that created a shorter <italic>cic-S</italic> transcript and subsequent evolution of a functional N2 motif via random drift. In this regard, it has been argued that short peptide sequences such as the WRPW and eh1 Gro-interacting motifs may be particularly easy to evolve by simple drift <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Hittinger1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>The N2 motif is different from the WRPW and eh1 motifs, and we still do not know its precise mechanism of action. By analogy to the WRPW and eh-1 motifs, which bind the central pore of the Gro &#946; propeller, it is possible that N2 also recognizes this region of Gro. If this is correct, the N2 motif should adopt a conformation across the pore that is insensitive to the <italic>MB41</italic> mutation, just like another Gro mutation, <italic>MB31</italic>, prevents binding of WRPW but not eh-1 to the pore <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jennings2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Another, non-exclusive possibility is that N2 binds the Gro &#946; propeller with the help of auxiliary proteins. Consistent with this idea, the WRPY motif of Runx proteins binds very weakly to Gro and this interaction depends on other accessory proteins in vivo <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jennings2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Aronson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Canon1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>What could be the functional and evolutionary significance of the new Gro-dependent mechanism of Cic repression? It seems logical to assume that Cic employs qualitatively different mechanisms of repression in the embryo (via Gro) than when acting in other contexts (presumably with other corepressors; see below). We suggest that the combined activities of Cic-S and Gro may have facilitated the evolution of the complex transcriptional network regulated by Torso signaling in modern fly embryos. This network comprises multiple Cic target genes, including <italic>tll</italic> and <italic>hkb</italic>, whose boundaries of expression are regulated by Torso-dependent gradients of Cic repression at the embryo poles <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Lhr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Ajuria1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Helman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this system, Gro itself appears to exert a regulatory function beyond its obvious role as a component of the repression machinery. Indeed, Gro is directly phosphorylated and functionally downregulated in response to Torso signaling <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Cinnamon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Helman2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and even modest changes in Gro protein levels significantly affect the threshold concentrations at which Cic represses <italic>tll</italic> and <italic>hkb</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004902-TurkiJudeh2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This suggests a model where Torso signaling controls the expression of Cic target genes via coordinate activity gradients of both Cic and Gro. These overlapping gradients might serve as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the correct spatiotemporal response of target genes, buffering against random perturbations in either gradient. Furthermore, Gro is a highly versatile corepressor capable of functioning in different contexts of recruitment <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1004902-Mannervik1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Cinnamon2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, which may explain the ability of Cic to regulate multiple targets simultaneously. For example, <italic>tll</italic> and <italic>hkb</italic> are activated by different mechanisms that are either dependent (<italic>hkb</italic>) or independent (<italic>tll</italic>) of Lilliputian, a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, implying that Gro is capable of counteracting both activation mechanisms. Thus, the acquisition of Gro-mediated repression by Cic may have facilitated the precise, coordinated regulation of Cic target genes in response to Torso signaling.</p><p>In contrast, Gro is mostly dispensable for other Cic functions in the wing and the follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004902-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The Cic-S isoform is sufficient for both of these functions <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Goff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Roch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Astigarraga1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, raising the possibility that Cic-S acts through other corepressors in those tissues. One potential candidate is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of mammalian Atxn1 (dAtxn1; <xref rid="pgen.1004902-Tsuda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>).

Similarly, the mammalian Cic-S isoform must have originated independently of the dipteran Cic-S isoform, resulting in coincidental presence of Cic-S isoforms in both taxa. It will be interesting to determine whether mammalian Cic-S and Cic-L proteins also exhibit differential functional properties in their ability to regulate gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>

The LD17181 product (LD17181p) was expressed from the ATG initiator codon present in the <italic>cic-S</italic> rescue construct, by replacing the sequence encoding amino acids 4&#8211;19 of Cic-S with the sequence encoding amino acids 3&#8211;487 of LD17181p; note that amino acid 20 of Cic-S corresponds to amino acid 488 of LD17181p. Cic-L<sup>N2</sup> was constructed by inserting an N2-containing fragment (residues 4-35 of Cic-S) at amino acid position 852 of LD17181p. All Cic derivatives have a triple HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) inserted in the same position, corresponding to amino acid 1398 of Cic-S. Hairy fusion proteins contain amino acids 1-268 of Hairy fused to the following Cic sequences: amino acids 3-35 (Hairy<sup>N2</sup>), and 1308-1396 (Hairy<sup>C1</sup>) of Cic-S, and amino acids 376-437 (Hairy<sup>N1</sup>) and 468-503 (Hairy<sup>N2-L</sup>) of LD17181p.
