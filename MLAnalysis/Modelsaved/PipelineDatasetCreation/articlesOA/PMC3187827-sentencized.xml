</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) metabolizes a range of peptidic substrates and plays a key role in blood pressure regulation and vascular remodeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, elevated ACE levels may be associated with an increased risk for different cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previously, a striking familial elevation in blood ACE was explained by mutations in the ACE juxtamembrane region that enhanced the cleavage-secretion process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found a family whose affected members had a 6-fold increase in blood ACE and a Tyr465Asp (Y465D) substitution, distal to the stalk region, in the N domain of ACE. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE, CD143) is a Zn2+ dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase which plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and in the development of vascular pathology and remodeling [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ACE is constitutively expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, different absorptive epithelial and neuroepithelial cells [5]–[13], and cells of the immune system (macrophages, dendritic cells) [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Somatic ACE (ACE) contains two catalytic centers in the N- and C-terminal ectodomains [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>ACE was assigned as a common differentiation marker - CD143 [11], [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Besides membrane-bound forms of ACE, blood and other biological fluids contain a variable amount of soluble ACE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Serum ACE most likely originates from endothelial cells [19], mostly from lung – due to preferential ACE expression in lung capillaries [11], [13], [20] - by proteolytic cleavage [21]–[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Soluble ACE from CHO cells transfected with human ACE cDNA and porcine ACE have C-termini consistent with cleavage of the Arg1203-Ser1204 peptide bond in a stalk region near the transmembrane domain [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The cleavage/secretion process is catalyzed by an unidentified membrane-bound ACE secretase [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, the level of ACE in the blood is very stable [25], whereas granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis in particular) and Gaucher's disease lead to a significant increase of ACE activity in the blood [26]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Serial serum ACE measurements now are an essential tool for the diagnosis and monitoring the clinical course of sarcoidosis [29]–[31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A mutation in the stalk region of ACE – Pro1199Leu [32]–[33] – explained a dramatic (5-fold) increase in ACE activity in the blood of affected individuals from Holland [32], Germany [34], and the USA [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that people with this mutation exhibit no clinical abnormalities [32], testing for this mutation is of considerable clinical importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, failure to appreciate that elevation of ACE levels is genetically determined in an affected individual may lead to false diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis and consequently to unnecessary long-term immunosuppressive treatment [34] or diagnostic procedures [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Another mutation in the stalk region that introduced a premature termination codon (Trp1197Stop) led to direct secretion of mutant ACE into the circulation and consequently a 14-fold increase in blood ACE [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of a new mutation in ACE, substitution of Tyr in position 465 in the N domain to Asp (Y465D), which is distal to the stalk region, where proteolytic cleavage occurs, and leads to significant increase in the rate of ACE shedding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This mutation occurs in the interface of an N-domain dimer observed during crystallization of the N domain of ACE [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Y465D substitution results in significant local conformational changes in ACE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the Y465D mutation affects the extent of ACE dimerization and increases the accessibility of either the stalk region for cleavage or a secondary binding site/recognition domain of ACE, thus confirming our hypothesis of a link between ACE dimerization and shedding [39]–[40]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In this study, we ascribed a 5–7-fold elevation of plasma ACE to a novel ACE mutation in which the codon GAT, encoding Tyr465 in the N domain of ACE, is substituted in one allele by TAT coding for Asp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The identification and characterization of this and other [32], [33] mutations that result in increased shedding of ACE are of considerable clinical importance considering that a genetically determined increase in plasma ACE may lead to false diagnosis of sarcoidosis and, consequently, to unnecessary long-term immunosuppressive treatment [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Levels of plasma ACE appear to be affected in two ways: either through the regulation of gene expression and genetically linked to loci in the promoter region of the ACE gene and other genomic loci, or through spontaneous alterations of the ACE gene itself as in the case of the Tyr465Asp and Pro1199Leu mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The link between the alteration in plasma ACE levels due to the Y465D mutation and the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, pain, depression and/or fatigue in affected individuals remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Particularly since this is the first mutation described that is associated with adverse clinical symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The main reason for the absence of clinical abnormalities in these patients is that their tissue ACE, generally 10- to 30-fold higher than blood ACE, remains unaltered and thus the overall substrate hydrolysis does not change significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the reason why most members of this family with the Y465D mutation (6 out of 7) have one or more of the above symptoms is due to elevation of plasma substance P or other neuropeptides shown to be involved in similar neuropathophysiological disorders [Nesterovitch et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>2011, in preparation]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>There are two possible mechanistic scenarios: firstly, symptomatic family members could have an additional mutation in another gene which is responsible for aberrant metabolism and/or processing of neuropeptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the Y465D mutation could result in a second phenotype - altered hydrolysis of ACE substrates, such as substance P or similar and as yet unknown neuropeptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the rate of hydrolysis of artificial, synthetic substrates Hip-His-Leu and Z-Phe-His-Leu was not changed due to the Y465D substitution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>However, these experiments were carried out with soluble ACE proteolytically released from the membrane and the conformation and kinetics of the soluble and membrane-bound forms of ACE can differ significantly [61]–[62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Thus, one cannot exclude the likelihood that one mutation of ACE causes both elevated blood ACE due to increased ACE shedding, and elevated levels of neuropeptide(s), such as substance P, resulting in neuropathological symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have identified a novel Y465D mutation that results in dramatic elevation of serum ACE, and is associated with adverse clinical symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Since elevated plasma ACE is often taken as a marker of disease activity such as in sarcoidosis and Gaucher's disease, it is important for clinicians and medical scientists to be aware of the alternative genetic causes of elevated blood ACE that may or may not be linked to disease. </plain></SENT>
