The molecular changes in common bean roots caused by SCN infection are unknown. Identification of genetic factors associated with SCN resistance could help in development of improved bean varieties with high SCN resistance. Gene expression profiling was conducted on common bean roots infected by SCN HG type 0 using next generation RNA sequencing technology. Two pinto bean genotypes, PI533561 and GTS-900, resistant and susceptible to SCN infection, respectively, were used as RNA sources eight days post inoculation. Total reads generated ranged between ~ 3.2 and 5.7 million per library and were mapped to the common bean reference genome. Approximately 70&#8211;90% of filtered RNA-seq reads uniquely mapped to the reference genome. In the inoculated roots of resistant genotype PI533561, a total of 353 genes were differentially expressed with 154 up-regulated genes and 199 down-regulated genes when compared to the transcriptome of non- inoculated roots. On the other hand, 990 genes were differentially expressed in SCN-inoculated roots of susceptible genotype GTS-900 with 406 up-regulated and 584 down-regulated genes when compared to non-inoculated roots. Genes encoding nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat resistance (NLR) proteins, WRKY transcription factors, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and heat shock proteins involved in diverse biological processes were differentially expressed in both resistant and susceptible genotypes. Overall, suppression of the photosystem was observed in both the responses. Furthermore, RNA-seq results were validated through quantitative real time PCR. This is the first report describing genes/transcripts involved in SCN-common bean interaction and the results will have important implications for further characterization of SCN resistance genes in common bean.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Speciality Crop Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>14-226</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Berlin D Nelson Jr.</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Specialty Crop Grant Northarvest Bean Grower association.

[<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159338.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Beans are the primary source of protein (22% of seed weight) for over 4 billion people in developing countries (FAO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org/">http://faostat.fao.org/</ext-link>). Beans in combination with cereals are a complete source of proteins and other micro/macronutrients and can help eliminate malnutrition. North Dakota and northern Minnesota are the top producers of beans in the United Stated with about 50% of the production (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usdrybeans.com/resources/production/production-facts/">http://www.usdrybeans.com/resources/production/production-facts/</ext-link>). Principal market classes grown in this region are pinto, navy, black, and kidney beans.</p><p>Soybean cyst nematode (<italic>Heterodera glycines</italic> Ichinohe; SCN) is an obligate sedentary endoparasite and the most destructive pathogen of soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.) in the world causing losses of approximately $1 billion annually in the USA alone [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SCN does not cause unique aboveground symptoms and can be confused with symptoms of nutrient deficiency, drought stress, herbicide injury or soil-borne fungal disease. SCN can spread readily from field to field in soil particles on farm machinery. SCN has been found in every soybean producing state in the United States except New York and West Virginia [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In North Dakota and northern Minnesota, SCN was first found in soybean fields in 2003. There are differences in virulence within the SCN population with virulent types termed HG types. In North Dakota and northern Minnesota the predominant virulent type is HG 0, previously known as race 3. The primary management of SCN in soybean is the use of resistant cultivars and crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce nematode populations in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The soybean genotypes Peking and PI88788 are the major sources of SCN resistance in commercial soybean varieties. However, due to shifts in virulent HG types, the major source of SCN resistance from PI88788 used in most commercial soybean cultivars is now less effective in some US production areas since new HG types such as HG 2.5.7 can reproduce on that resistance source [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, it is imperative to identify novel resistance genes from different sources to incorporate more effective genes into cultivars for resistance to predominant SCN HG types. Resistance to SCN is quantitative and major QTLs have been mapped on chromosomes 18 (<italic>rhg1</italic>) and 8 (<italic>Rhg4</italic>) in many soybean cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The SCN resistance of <italic>rhg1</italic> is contributed by multi-copy <underline><italic toggle="yes">rhg1</italic></underline> haplotypes forming two distinct resistant groups i.e. high copy number <italic>rhg1</italic> accessions and low copy number <italic>rhg1</italic> accessions [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. High copy number <italic>rhg1</italic> group (PI 88788-type) contain 7&#8211;10 copies of a 31 kb <italic>rhg1</italic> repeat segment while the low copy number <italic>rhg1</italic> group (Peking-type) contains 3 copies of the <italic>rhg1</italic> repeat along with a newly identified allele of Glyma18g02590. Three different genes encoding a predicted amino acid transporter (Glyma18g02580), an &#945;&#8211;SNAP protein (Glyma18g02590) and a protein with wound-inducible protein 12 (WI12) (Glyma18g02610) are present in 31 kb <italic>rhg1</italic> repeat segment and contribute to SCN resistance [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The SCN resistance of <italic>Rhg4</italic> is controlled by a serine hydroxymethyl transferase gene [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>Rhg4</italic> exhibits dominant gene action for resistance to race 3 of SCN [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/nature11651.html-ref5">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/nature11651.html-ref5</ext-link> and is one of the major QTLs controlling soybean resistance to SCN race 3 (HG type 0) in cv. Forrest [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Roots of plants carrying <italic>Rhg</italic> genes are penetrated by infective juveniles, but feeding cells ultimately degenerate, causing the nematodes to die before reaching adult stages.</p><p>Some common bean genotypes are considered excellent hosts for SCN [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Averaged over a selection of genotypes, Poromarto and Nelson [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that kidney beans are highly susceptible, navy and pinto beans are moderately susceptible and black beans are moderately resistant. These results indicated high susceptibility to moderate resistance that could be grouped by market class and/or genetic origin and background. The reduction of plant growth and seed yield in three different bean classes (pinto, kidney and navy) from HG 0 under field conditions indicated a potential threat to the common bean industry [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There is serious concern that SCN could become a major problem for common bean production in the North Dakota-Minnesota region. Black bean is one of the major classes in this region and is moderately resistant. However, there are no known commercial bean varieties with high levels of resistance to SCN in the other three major bean classes, i.e. pinto, navy and kidney, grown in this area. This potential threat of SCN to common bean production has initiated breeding efforts at North Dakota State University to incorporate SCN resistance into bean germplasm for eventual production of SCN resistant varieties.</p><p>Screening of the USDA core collection of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> germplasm against SCN HG type 0 has identified resistant genotypes in some accessions [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the genetic control of SCN resistance in common bean is completely unknown. Understanding the genetics of resistance will aid in the development of resistant varieties. In addition, the findings from common bean could have applications in soybean as well given the high level of synteny reported between the two species at the genomic level [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Common bean (2n = 22) belongs to the Leguminosae (Fabaceae) family. It has a genome size of approximately 521.1 Mbp consisting of few duplicated loci [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and about 49% transposable elements [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With the availability of genome sequence information for common bean [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], transcriptome analyses may be a fast and cost-effective way to find differentially expressed genes under biotic stress, ultimately leading to the characterization of signaling pathways in the SCN defense response. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies that provide relatively cheap deep-sequencing, RNA-seq has become the best approach for transcriptome profiling [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Comparative transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq has been successfully performed in various non-model and model species [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. RNA-seq has been successfully used in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during SCN infection in soybean [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159338.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and cereal cyst nematode infection in <italic>Aegilopus variabilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, similar studies have not been conducted in common bean. Resistance genes to SCN HG types have been identified in soybean and are frequently utilized in breeding programs to develop resistant cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159338.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Soybean is a close relative to common bean and extensive macrosyntentic relationships exist between the species [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159338.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The synteny blocks between these two species can help in identifying the orthologous genes in common bean involved in the SCN resistance mechanism. The availability of the RNA-seq information of common bean will accelerate the gene identification related to SCN resistance</p><p>To understand the mechanism of SCN resistance in common bean, it is necessary to characterize differential gene expression as the result of the host parasite interactions which will provide clues to the physiological changes and reprogramming that occur in the host during compatible and incompatible interactions. Such information could lead to the identity of host genes involved in the resistance response and provide valuable clues as to the specific mechanisms involved in resistance. In addition, the identity of those genes with functional polymorphism contributing to incompatible interactions with SCN could improve our ability to identify resistance in common bean germplasm and improve the breeding efforts by identifying molecular markers to incorporate resistance into commercial bean varieties. The objective of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes that are biologically relevant for establishment of incompatibility during SCN infection in common bean and lay the foundation for identification of genes involved in resistance mechanisms. The study also provides a transcriptome framework for comparing and identifying differential physiological changes occurring in resistant and susceptible plants during SCN infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plants, egg sources and inoculation</title><p>Two pinto bean genotypes GTS-900 and PI533561 were used for the analysis in this study. GTS-900 is a pinto bean variety released by GEN-TEC seeds Ltd. with high seed quality and is resistant to race 1 of bean common mosaic virus and anthracnose. Additionally, GTS-900 is susceptible to SCN HG type 0 [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159338.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Pinto bean plant introduction (PI) line PI533561 was selected from the USDA core collection of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> based on resistance to SCN HG 0 and good agronomic qualities such as plant architecture, seed shape and color and overall plant health. The plant growth system and inoculation method were described previously [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Following surface disinfection with 1.0% NaOCl and a subsequent water rinse, seeds were germinated on germination paper for 3 days. Healthy germinated seedlings of uniform size were transplanted into individual plastic &#8220;Cone-tainers&#8221; (Suewe &amp; Sons, type SC10 Super Cell) containing autoclaved river sand, then inoculated with 2000 eggs of SCN HG type 0 in a water suspension. The SCN egg source was originally obtained from an infested soybean field in North Dakota. Control plants were mock-inoculated with water. The Cone-tainers were placed in autoclaved sand in plastic pots, 30.5 cm in diameter by 30.5 cm deep (Cambro, Huntington Beach, CA), and immersed in a water bath at 27&#177;3&#176;C in a greenhouse. Plants received both natural and supplemental light using high-pressure sodium lamps (1,000 &#956;E m<sup>&#8211;2</sup> s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) for 16 h/day. Before conducting the gene expression profiling, the resistance response of the two genotypes was verified by inoculating five plants from each genotype, then determining the female index after 30 days growth at 27&#177;3&#176;C. Female index is a measurement of the ability of a SCN population to reproduce on a genotype and was calculated as described in Poromarto and Nelson [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Total RNA extraction and purification of mRNA from total RNA</title><p>Two independent biological replicates per treatment were grown at different times under the same conditions as described above and entire root tissue was collected eight days post inoculation (dpi) with SCN.

The results indicated that these TFs were involved in regulation of ROS induced programmed cell death along with SGT1b, a component of ubiquitin mediated protein degradation. A key role of ROS was found in the hypersensitive response during R-mediated resistance mechanisms to different pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and genes involved in regulating ROS are often up-regulated [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Genes having a role in ROS scavenging pathways such as glutathione transferase, heat shock proteins and peroxidases were differentially expressed in both the genotypes. Differential expression of genes related to cell wall synthesis and remodeling in common bean were also shown in this study. The components of plant cell walls are modified during attack by pathogens as their first line of defense [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and cell wall degradations occur during syncytium development due to the cell wall modifying and degrading proteins produced in cyst nematode infections [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The structural cell wall proteins such as hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGPs) are catalyzed by an oxidizing system based on peroxidase and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and contribute to the strength of cell walls during pine wood nematode responses [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Two HRGPs (Phvul.001G044200 and Phvul.005G135700) were upregulated during the resistance response to SCN infection in the present study.

The balance between the formation of ROS and changes in the transcripts for cell wall remodeling enzymes seems to be important for the reaction of plants under stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

In this study, 24 photosynthesis related genes were down regulated in the resistant genotype, while 38 photosynthesis related genes were down regulated in the susceptible genotype. This indicates suppression of the photosystem in the resistant and susceptible genotypes after SCN infection. A similar response was observed with SCN infection in soybean plants where both photosystem I and II were suppressed [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

Several GO terms, for example, single-organism metabolic process, transport, primary metabolic process, stress or defense responses, biotic stimulus, abiotic stimulus, signaling responses and cellular signaling were enriched in the resistant genotype. In the susceptible genotype, the enriched GO terms included cellular process (GO:0009987), metabolic process (GO:0008152), single organism process (GO:0044699), biological regulation (GO:0065007) and response to stimulus (GO:0050896). Nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO:0006807) seems to play an important role as this was enriched in both genotypes. Interestingly, a decrease in photosynthetic activity (GO:0015979) due to SCN infection was also observed in both genotypes. Hosseini and Matthews [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] also demonstrated that photosynthesis was one of the most suppressed GO processes in soybean following SCN infection. Suppression of photosynthesis related genes have also been observed in other pathogen-plant interactions as well. For example, transcripts encoding for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins were down-regulated during fungal infection in common bean [<xref rid="pone.0159338.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0159338.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0159338.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Classification of differentially expressed genes based on biological processes in a common bean genotype resistant to <italic>Heterodera glycines</italic>.</title><p>Significant gene ontology categories (p &lt; 0.05) along with the number of genes involved are indicated for differentially expressed genes.

These were genes encoding WRKY transcription factor, serine protease, ATOX1, glutathione S-transferase, wound induced protein, leucine rich repeat, heat shock protein, ENOD93, Thaumatin family and GAT ase1_1.

The WRKY transcription factor (Phvul.002G265400) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159338.g006">Fig 6</xref>) was also upregulated in both resistant and susceptible genotypes after SCN infection as occurred in their corresponding non-inoculated controls.

Likewise, Genes encoding wound induced protein (Phvul.006G102300) and heat shock protein (Phvul.011G016100) showed higher expression in both genotypes in RNA-seq and qPCR experiments.

RNA sequencing technology was used to identify differentially expressed genes 8 days after inoculation of SCN resistant and susceptible genotypes of common bean. Importantly, we identified multiple TFs and protein kinases that were modulated by SCN infection. The differentially expressed genes identified are reported to be involved in similar pathways in the closely related host-pathogen interaction of soybean-SCN. Functional classification based on GO and enrichment analyses demonstrated up-regulation of genes for 10 different categories in biological processes such as metabolic process, cellular process, single-organism process and response to stimuli. RNA-seq data was further validated through qPCR. Further characterization of some of the differentially expressed genes may lead to genetic engineering by over-expressing defense related genes or silencing genes that promote syncytium formation to manage the plant parasitic nematode infestations. Overall, comparative transcription profiling provided valuable information on SCN resistance in common bean, which can aid future development of resistant common bean varieties.</p><p>Research extended our understanding of the genetic architecture of SCN resistance in two different genetic backgrounds. The results also have potential implications for comparative gene discovery in legumes and development of new resources for identifying markers for marker assisted selection. Functional characterization of some of the candidate genes and genetic mapping of SCN resistance using the same genotypes used in this study are currently underway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of genes differentially expressed in resistant genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>List of genes differentially expressed in susceptible genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes in resistant genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes in susceptible genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>GO and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in resistant genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159338.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>GO and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in susceptible genotype after SCN infection.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159338.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Susilo Poromarto, NDSU, for initial screening of the common bean genotypes for SCN resistance.
