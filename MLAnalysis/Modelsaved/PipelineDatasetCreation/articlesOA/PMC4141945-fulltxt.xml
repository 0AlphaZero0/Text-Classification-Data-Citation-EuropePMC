MUI occurs when symptoms of both stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) are present. According to the literature, the prevalence of MUI in women range from 16 to 61% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In China, the prevalence is 9.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of MUI is challenging because the symptoms of SUI and UUI occur concurrently. Management options include absorbent products, behavioral modification, medical management, and surgery. Behavioral therapy (such as lifestyle modification, bladder training and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)) should be considered as a first-line option for all women with MUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although recommended for MUI, PFMT is the most commonly recommended physical therapy for women with SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Its benefit seems to be greater in women with SUI alone as compared with women with mixed SUI and UUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, for the treatment of MUI, drug therapy is usually used in combination with PFMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Solifenacin is a M3 receptor selective antimuscarinic agent, launched in 2005 for the treatment of overactive bladder. It relieves the symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia and urgency incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of seven studies, the mean and median reduction in the number of urgency episodes with solifenacin was greater than with several other agents such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, and darifenacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For this study, the combination of PFMT and solifenacin will serve as a control against electroacupuncture.</p><p>Acupuncture has a long history and is a widely used conservative treatment option for many diseases, including urinary incontinence. A literature review showed that acupuncture improves symptoms of both SUI and UUI, and it seems to have long-term benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Based on this, acupuncture is a reasonable treatment option for MUI.</p><p>This is a protocol for a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of the study is to compare the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) versus PFMT plus solifenacin in patients with MUI. The secondary objective is to ascertain whether EA is effective for another 12 to 24&#160;weeks after the therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial and will be conducted from March 2014 to August 2015 across 10 hospitals in China<sup>a</sup>.</p><p>Participants with urinary incontinence will be recruited through advertisements in newspapers, on television, on websites and posters. The diagnosis of incontinence type and severity will be made by a gynecologist or a urologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. After obtaining informed consent, patients with moderate MUI will receive a 1-week baseline assessment, including a 72-hour voiding diary, a 1-hour pad test, routine urinalysis, a urine flow rate assessment and a bladder ultrasound. Randomization will be performed centrally by the Clinical Evaluation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing, and eligible participants will be randomized to the EA group or the control group.

According to our pilot trial and review of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the proportion of change in 72-hour IEF from baseline for EA and PFMT plus solifenacin, is 57 and 60% respectively. To assess non-inferiority between the treatment and control groups, a sample size of 242 for each group will be sufficient, with a one-sided 5% level of significance, a power of 80% and allowing for a 15% dropout. This will exceed the non-inferiority margin of 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, in this trial, we will aim to recruit 250 participants in each group.</p><p>Data from the 10 centers will be pooled, and the Clinical Evaluation Center of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing will conduct the statistical analysis, using the SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) and SPSS Ver.13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. All statistical analyses will be two-sided tests except for the primary outcome. The level of significance will be established at 0.05. Continuous data will be represented by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value; categorical data will be represented by percentages. For comparison with the baseline, a t-test or nonparametric test will be used for continuous data, and nonparametric tests for categorical data. For comparison of two independent samples a t-test or nonparametric test will be used for continuous data, and a chi-square test or the Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. The primary outcome is the proportion of change from baseline in 72-h IEF. Analysis of covariance (for normal distributed data) or nonparametric tests (for abnormal distributed data) will be used. To detect the center effect, a covariance model will be used. Further analysis will be done if there is a center effect. Analysis methods for secondary outcomes are presented in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For safety analysis, incidence of adverse events will be compared between the two groups using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial, we intend to compare the efficacy of EA versus PFMT plus solifenacin. Although PFMT is effective for the treatment of MUI, long-term adherence is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, compliance with muscarinic antagonists is poor; owing to its side effects (such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Acupuncture is a non-toxic, economical intervention with minimal adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which has been shown to remain effective even for a few months after the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. If the efficacy of EA is non-inferior to PFMT plus solifenacin, it may be a reasonable option in patients with MUI, requiring a conservative approach. One of the limitations in this trial design, is the non-blinding of the participants and acupuncturists. Due to the characteristics of acupuncture and the control (drug and PFMT), it is impossible to blind the participants and acupuncturists. However, we will rigorous methodology in other part of the study.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial status</title><p>Twelve participants have been recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>Guang&#8217;anmen Hospital; Dongzhimen Hospital (Beijing); West China Hospital (Chengdu); Yantai TCM Hospital (Yantai); Hengyang Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine (Hengyang); The First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine (Changsha); Hubei Provincial Hospital of TCM (Wuhan); Jiangsu Province Hospital of TCM (Nanjing); Shanxi Province Hospital of TCM (Xi&#8217;an) and The Hiser Healthcare (Qingdao).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#8217; contributions</bold></p><p>ZL, BL and YC conceived the design of the trial.
