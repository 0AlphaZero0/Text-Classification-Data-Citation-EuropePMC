It binds to carbohydrates on pathogens to activate the lectin pathway of complement and together with its associated serine protease MASP-3 serves as a guidance cue for neural crest development. High serum levels are associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, where spontaneous clotting can lead to multiple organ failure. Autosomal mutations in the CL-K1 or MASP-3 genes cause a developmental disorder called 3MC (Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech and Michels) syndrome, characterised by facial, genital, renal and limb abnormalities. One of these mutations (Gly<sup>204</sup>Ser in the CL-K1 gene) is associated with undetectable levels of protein in the serum of affected individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we show that CL-K1 primarily targets a subset of high-mannose oligosaccharides present on both self- and non-self structures, and provide the structural basis for its ligand specificity. We also demonstrate that three disease-associated mutations prevent secretion of CL-K1 from mammalian cells, accounting for the protein deficiency observed in patients. Interestingly, none of the mutations prevent folding or oligomerization of recombinant fragments containing the mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Instead, they prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by the carbohydrate-recognition domains of CL-K1. We propose that failure to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> during biosynthesis leads to structural defects that prevent secretion of CL-K1, thus providing a molecular explanation of the genetic disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have established the sugar specificity of CL-K1 and demonstrated that it targets high-mannose oligosaccharides on self- and non-self structures via an extended binding site which recognises the terminal two mannose residues of the carbohydrate ligand. We have also shown that mutations associated with a rare developmental disorder called 3MC syndrome prevent the secretion of CL-K1, probably as a result of structural defects caused by disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding during biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-015-0136-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Complement activation</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>C-type lectin</kwd><kwd>3MC syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Collectin-K1 (CL-K1) is a multifunctional secreted pattern-recognition lectin with key roles in host defence, tissue homeostasis and embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It binds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and activates mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases (MASPs-1, &#8722;2 and &#8722;3) to initiate the lectin pathway of complement activation, and stimulate immune and inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It also binds to apoptotic cells and may function as a scavenger receptor to facilitate their clearance as has been shown for other collectins. Elevated serum levels are associated with a severe clotting disorder called disseminated intravascular coagulation, characterised by systemic coagulation and microvascular thrombi, that often leads to multiple organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During embryogenesis, CL-K1 is highly expressed in craniofacial cartilage, heart, bronchi, kidney, and vertebral bodies and together with MASP-3 probably serves as a guidance cue for neural crest cell migration by recognising specific endogenous carbohydrate epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Separate autosomal mutations in the genes encoding CL-K1 or MASP-3 lead to a rare autosomal recessive disorder called Carnevale, Mingarelli, Malpuech and Michels (3MC) syndrome, associated with craniofacial dysmorphism, mental retardation and genital, renal and limb abnormalities, highlighting the importance of these complexes during development.</p><p>CL-K1 is a member of the collectin family of animal lectins with an N-terminal collagen-like domain linked to C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) via a helical neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The collagenous stems are tethered together at the N-terminus to form characteristic bouquet- or fan-shaped structures. CL-K1 can form homooligomers as well as heterooligomers with the related molecule collectin-L1 (CL-L1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clusters of CRDs recognise their carbohydrate targets through multiple weak interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an essential role in this process by forming a ternary complex with the protein and the glycan ligand and by stabilising the CRDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. CL-K1 binds to a variety of intact bacteria, fungi, and viruses including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and Influenza A virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It also binds to DNA, explaining at least in part how it targets apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although selective for mannose and fucose, CL-K1 binds only weakly to monosaccharides (IC<sub>50</sub> approximately 20 mM) compared to MBL (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> approximately 1 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and other collectins, and little is known about its specificity towards oligosaccharides on self- or non-self structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Three separate disease-associated mutations have been identified in the coding region of the CL-K1 gene. All lead to changes in the primary structure of the CRD: two result in single amino acid substitutions: Ser<sup>169</sup>Pro and Gly<sup>204</sup>Ser and the third leads to the deletion of Ser<sup>217</sup>. CL-K1 is undetectable in the serum of individuals homozygous for the Gly<sup>204</sup>Ser mutation, implying that it is either not secreted or is degraded in serum. However, the other disease-associated mutations have not been characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Here we show that CL-K1 primarily recognises a subset of high-mannose oligosaccharides containing the disaccharide motif: Man(&#945;1-2)Man found on both self and non-self structures. It binds to both sugar moieties, in contrast to other collectins that only recognise the terminal sugar. We also show that all three mutations associated with 3MC syndrome prevent normal secretion from mammalian cells probably as a result of structural changes caused by the failure to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> during biosynthesis. The protein deficiency would prevent the normal recognition processes of CL-K1/MASP-3 complexes during development, leading to the 3MC phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sugar specificity of CL-K1 towards self and non-self ligands</title><p>To characterise the sugar specificity of CL-K1, we initially screened a selection of glycoproteins with well-characterised glycans (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Blot analysis revealed binding to immunoglobulin M (IgM), thyroglobulin and yeast invertase and mannan, but not to RNAse B, fetuin or IgG. The most discernible difference in the pattern of recognition was the presence of high-mannose oligosaccharides on the glycoproteins that were recognised, compared to predominantly complex sugars on those that were not. An exception was RNAse B, which possesses a single N-linked glycosylation site, mainly occupied by Man<sub>5</sub> (approximately 60%) but with some Man<sub>6</sub>-Man<sub>9</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To explore carbohydrate binding further, the binding kinetics was determined for yeast invertase, mannan and gp120 from HIV that all possess high-mannose oligosaccharides. CL-K1 bound tightly to all three glycoproteins, but not to milk lactoferrin that contains complex sugars (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In each case, the data fitted best to a two-complex model and the kinetic parameters are presented in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. To confirm that carbohydrate binding leads to activation of complement, C3b deposition was measured on mannan in whole human serum depleted of endogenous lectins (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). CL-K1 activated complement with only 2.5-fold lower activity than human MBL.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Glycoprotein binding and complement activation by CL-K1. <bold>A)</bold> Immunoblot of CL-K1 binding to immobilised mammalian and yeast glycoproteins. <bold>B)</bold> Surface plasmon resonance of CL-K1 binding to glycoproteins.

The array consisted of 377 natural and synthetic mammalian glycans attached to the surface of a glass microscope slide via covalent amide linkages. The relative fluorescence signal provides an accurate indication of the order of affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consistent with the glycoprotein data, the best ligands were all high-mannose oligosaccharides (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), but not all of these were recognised. Mammalian high-mannose structures comprise a Man<sub>5</sub> core attached to the protein via two GlcNAc residues, with &#945;1-2 linked sugars at the non-reducing termini (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). CL-K1 only recognised those structures containing at least one terminal Man(&#945;1-2)Man epitope. For example, it bound tightly to Man<sub>6,</sub> Man<sub>7</sub>, Man<sub>8</sub> and Man<sub>9</sub> but not to the Man<sub>5</sub> core (ligand 310) that comprises only &#945;1-3 and &#945;1-6 linkages. It also bound to smaller glycans containing the essential disaccharide epitope, for example, the trisaccharide, Man(&#945;1-2)Man(&#945;1-3)Man (ligand 189). The GlcNAc residues were neither necessary nor enhanced binding (for example, compare Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNac<sub>2</sub>, ligand 192, and Man<sub>9</sub>, ligand 312). This pattern of recognition is different from other collectins, such as MBL and pulmonary-surfactant protein D that typically recognise the terminal sugar alone (mannose, fucose or N-acetyglucosamine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is also different from other C-type lectins, such as DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR that target larger high-mannose oligosaccharides preferentially (Man<sub>5</sub> to Man<sub>9</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To quantify the differences in affinities, we compared binding to three different epitopes that all form part of a high-mannose oligosaccharide. Inhibition by Man(&#945;1-2)Man (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.02 mM) was 10- and 8-fold greater than for the Man<sub>3</sub> and Man<sub>5</sub> core structures, and &gt;300-fold greater than for mannose alone (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Thus, CL-K1 primarily recognises the terminal disaccharide of the glycan, rather than the terminal sugar alone, explaining its unusual binding properties.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Carbohydrate binding by CL-K1. <bold>A)</bold> Glycan-array analysis of CL-K1.

Most fucosylated sugars were not recognised, however, suggesting that CL-K1 contacts multiple monosaccharide moieties in each glycan and that the chemical environment of the binding epitope is important. Binding to almost all ligands was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), compatible with the pivotal role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in carbohydrate recognition by C-type lectins. An exception was 9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, which gave a similar binding signal in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, implying that it interacts with a distinct and independent binding site on CL-K1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Structure of CL-K1 in complex with a disaccharide ligand</title><p>In order to determine the precise specificity and mechanism of carbohydrate recognition by CL-K1, a recombinant trimeric fragment comprising the neck and CRDs was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, refolded from inclusion bodies and was crystallized in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and structures were determined both with and without its primary ligand, Man(&#945;1-2)Man (PDB: 4YLI and 4YMD for the CL-K1 trimer and the trimer bound to Man(&#945;1-2)Man; Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The structures confirm that the CL-K1 fragment is a homotrimer with the three CRDs linked via an &#945;-helical coiled coil (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The asymmetric unit of each crystal contained two trimers with each CRD bound to three Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Density for the sugar was present for four of the six polypeptides (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B). In the ligand complex, the reducing mannose of the disaccharide binds to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> common to all C-type lectins, with the equatorial 3- and 4-OHs of the sugar forming coordination bonds with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen bonds to surrounding Asn, Asp and Glu residues that also serve as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligands. The interaction is unusual, however, because it involves the penultimate sugar (internal in a high-mannose oligosaccharide) rather than the terminal sugar (non-reducing) that is recognised by other collectins (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the terminal mannose forms hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate group of Glu<sup>244</sup> and the guanidinium group of Arg<sup>200</sup> to form a small hydrogen-bonding network that stabilises the interaction compared to mannose alone, providing an explanation for its binding specificity. Comparison of the bound and unbound structures reveals no major conformational changes upon carbohydrate recognition. The interaction is somewhat reminiscent of glycan binding by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, which also target high-mannose oligosaccharides via internal sugar moieties (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E). The ligand specificities of CL-K1 and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR are significantly different, however, as noted above.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

It not only interacts directly with the carbohydrate ligand but also binds to loops at the top of the CRD. We used the intrinsic fluorescence of the trimeric fragment as a probe to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Each CRD contains two tryptophan residues, which together form part of the hydrophobic core and are sensitive to changes in the conformation of the adjacent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops. Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused a large enhancement of the native fluorescence (approximately 50%) combined with a shift in &#955;<sub>em, max</sub> to a shorter wavelength (from 346 nm to 339 nm), as the tryptophans move to a more hydrophobic environment (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A).

However, the midpoint (denaturation concentration) was 2.4 M and 1.4 M urea for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and -free forms (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilises the CRDs.</p><p>The three Ca<sup>2+</sup> interact with residues primarily from loops towards the top of the CRD (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these regions are likely to be more flexible. To investigate this possibility, we compared the susceptibility of the trimeric CL-K1 fragment towards trypsin, which preferentially cleaves disordered regions of proteins. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form was highly sensitive to trypsin (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). By contrast, an approximately 15 kDa fragment was generated in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was relatively resistant to further proteolysis (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E and F). This fragment was identified as the CRD by Edman degradation, beginning at residue Glu<sup>148</sup>. By measuring proteolysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> for calcium was determined as approximately 1 mM, in good agreement with fluorescence data (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D and F). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilises the CRD by tethering the binding loops together. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these loops become disordered and more exposed.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>No secretion of variant CL-K1s containing mutations associated with 3MC syndrome. <bold>A)</bold> Structure of the CRD of CL-K1 showing the position of mutations associated with 3MC syndrome.

This finding was unexpected because we anticipated that the mutations would severely destabilise the CRDs, thus preventing folding. It was therefore of interest to characterise these fragments in more detail to attempt to understand why the mutations are deleterious and prevent secretion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Collectins normally fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> where resident chaperones monitor the folding status of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Misfolded or partially folded proteins with exposed hydrophobic regions are recognised by these chaperones, and are targeted for elimination via the ER-associated protein degradation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, any structural defects caused by the mutations are likely to prevent secretion. Circular dichroism indicated that all three variants were folded, with spectra characteristic of the &#945;/&#946; structure of the neck&#8201;+&#8201;CRD regions (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). This finding was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy and urea denaturation experiments (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A and B; described in more detail below). The first clue that they were defective was from gel filtration analysis. Like many lectins, CL-K1 binds to dextran, so is retarded on gel filtration columns such as Superdex. This binding could be prevented by excess mannose as a competitive inhibitor, or by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) that chelates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), whereupon the wild-type fragment eluted at the position of a homotrimer (47 kDa). The variant fragments were also trimers, but did not bind to the dextran matrix even in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, implying loss of carbohydrate binding. To confirm this possibility, we measured binding to yeast invertase. Both full-length CL-K1 and the wild-type fragment bound to the invertase, but the three variant fragments did not bind (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). Thus, although folded and assembled into trimers, the mutations disrupt the CRDs preventing normal interactions with carbohydrate ligands.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Characterisation of CL-K1 fragments containing disease-associated mutations. <bold>A)</bold> Gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (10/30 column) in 50 mM Tris&#8211;HCl at pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl.

As described above, failure to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> destabilises the CRDs and exposes flexible loop regions. The presence of such defects during biosynthesis would likely lead to elimination of CL-K1 polypeptides via ER resident chaperones. We therefore tested Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding using fluorescence assays described above. Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the variant CL-K1s did not cause the changes in quantum yield or &#955;<sub>em, max</sub> that were observed upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by the wild-type fragment (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Furthermore, urea denaturation curves resembled the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form, even in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with denaturation concentrations of 1.5, 1.3 and 1.4 M for Ser<sup>169</sup>Pro, Gly<sup>204</sup>Ser, &#916;Ser<sup>217</sup> proteins respectively (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Likewise, each of the variants was equally sensitive to trypsin in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Thus, all three mutations induce a common structural defect that arises due to the failure to bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, such defects are likely to be detected by chaperones in the ER during biosynthesis leading to elimination. In this way, the mutations would prevent normal secretion of CL-K1, accounting for the protein deficiency in patients with 3MC syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data described here explain for the first time how CL-K1 is able to target self- and non-self carbohydrate ligands to fulfil its diverse biological functions. Man(&#945;1-2)Man epitopes are found at the non-reducing termini of many, but not all, mammalian high-mannose sugars. They are also found on fungal, viral and bacterial structures. For example, mannan from cell walls of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a known target of CL-K1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], is rich in &#945;1-2 linked mannose oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Likewise, high-mannose oligosaccharides on viral haemagglutinin and gp120 enable CL-K1 to bind to Influenza A virus and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. High-mannose oligosaccharides themselves represent only a small subset of mammalian glycans. Most glycoproteins and glycolipids display complex oligosaccharides that are based on a Man<sub>3</sub>GlcNac<sub>2</sub> core not targeted by CL-K1, in which the two antennae are decorated with other sugars. The difference in specificity of CL-K1 compared to other collectins is due to the presence of an extended binding site on the CRD (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Whilst unusual for a collectin, additional interactions have been described for other C-type lectins including DC-SIGN, selectins and the macrophage receptor Mincle, each with different ligand preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Heterocomplexes of CL-K1 and CL-L1 polypeptides may recognise additional ligands that are not targeted by CL-K1 homooligomers as a result of contacts mediated through the CRD of CL-L1. Like CL-K1, CL-L1 has a preference for ligands possessing mannose and/or fucose epitopes, although little is known about its specificity towards oligosaccharides on self or non-self structures. The presence of CL-K1/CL-L1 complexes as well as CL-K1 homooligomers in serum and in other tissue fluids may serve to increase the range of pathogens targeted by the lectin pathway. It is currently unclear, however, if CL-L1 participates in developmental processes or is involved in the aetiology of 3MC syndrome.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for the structure and function of C-type lectins, because it stabilises the CRDs and helps position the loops in the correct arrangement for ligand binding. Although we were unable to crystallise CL-K1 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the structure of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form of MBL reveals that the core of the CRD is largely unchanged but the loops are positioned differently with some regions being undetectable in the electron density, implying considerable flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A similar scenario for the CL-K1 variants would explain why the CD spectra are similar to wild type but the CRDs are much more sensitive to proteolysis.</p><p>Gly204 and Ser217 are located at the base of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop L1 (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), so the disease-associated mutations probably interfere with the packing of this loop against the CRD, thereby preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. The effects of the Ser<sup>169</sup>Pro mutation within Helix 1 are less clear. Nevertheless, the introduction of a proline residue in place of the serine is likely to destabilise the helix and preclude the normal interactions with the CRD. Notably, Tyr163 at the top of the helix forms part of the hydrophobic core and packs against residues in loop 1, forming a hydrogen bond with Asn206. Disruption of these contacts probably prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, leading to the disease phenotype.</p><p>Folding of CL-K1, like other collectins, probably proceeds in a C- to N-terminal in which folding of the neck and CRDs nucleates assembly of the N-terminal collagen-like domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All three variant fragments folded and trimerised <italic>in vitro</italic>, so folding is still thermodynamically favourable, despite the mutations. It is thus likely that at least some polypeptides fold <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nevertheless, the CRDs will be defective with exposed, disordered regions, so variants are likely to be retained and subsequently eliminated by the ER-associated protein degradation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The possibility that the mutations prevent folding <italic>in vivo</italic> (but not <italic>in vitro</italic>) cannot be completely ruled out. However, this scenario would seem less likely, in particular because none of the mutations are greatly destabilising <italic>per se</italic> (Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Instead, the decrease in stability in each case can be accounted for by the failure to bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The finding that CL-K1 binds to Lewis antigens and certain blood group antigens, including groups B and H, is both interesting and unexpected. Lewis y is expressed mainly during embryogenesis, and in adults expression is restricted to granulocytes and epithelial surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Elevated levels are also found in most epithelial-derived human carcinomas, including breast, ovary, prostate, colon cancers, and high levels are correlated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Platelets and coagulatory factors such as Von Willebrand Factor are all decorated with blood group antigens, and crosslinking of these components possibly leading to complement activation might account for the link between elevated CL-K1 serum levels and disseminated intravascular coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Notably, activation of the lectin pathway itself promotes activation of the clotting cascade potentially compounding the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The larger binding pocket on CL-K1 and the resulting enhanced affinity for its glycan ligands compared to other collectins suggest that it may be possible to design inhibitors that selectively block ligand binding. These would have therapeutic potential for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation and other disorders associated with profound activation of the innate immune and/or coagulation systems, such as in ischaemia-reperfusion injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that CL-K1 binds to high-mannose oligosaccharides and fucosylated sugars including blood group antigens and Lewis antigens. It binds to high-mannose oligosaccharides via an extended binding site that recognises the terminal two mannose residues. In addition, we have shown that three naturally occurring mutations associated with a severe developmental disorder syndrome prevent secretion of CL-K1 from mammalian cells, probably as a result of a failure to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> during biosynthesis. The resulting protein deficiency would prevent normal developmental processes mediated via CL-K1/MASP-3 complexes leading to 3MC syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Proteins</title><p>Bovine fetuin and RNAse B, human milk lactoferrin, yeast invertase and yeast mannan were from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd.
