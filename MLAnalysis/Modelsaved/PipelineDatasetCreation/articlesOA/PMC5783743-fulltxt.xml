This post-translational modification is essential for the formation and maintenance of ribbon synapses in the retina. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP) are two glycosyltransferases whose deficiency is associated with severe dystroglycanopathies. These enzymes carry out in vitro the addition of a tandem ribitol 5-phosphate moiety to the so-called core M3 phosphotrisaccharide of &#945;-dystroglycan. However, their expression pattern and function in the healthy mammalian retina has not so far been investigated. In this work, we have addressed the expression of the <italic>FKTN</italic> (fukutin) and <italic>FKRP</italic> genes in the retina of mammals, and characterized the distribution pattern of their protein products in the adult mouse retina and the 661W photoreceptor cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>By means of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblotting, we have studied the expression at the mRNA and protein levels of the fukutin and FKRP genes in different mammalian species, from rodents to humans. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses were performed to characterize the distribution profile of their protein products in mouse retinal sections and in 661W cultured cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both genes were expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the neural retina of all mammals studied. Fukutin was present in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions in the mouse retina and 661W cells, and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. FKRP was located in the cytoplasmic fraction in the mouse retina and concentrated in the Golgi complex. However, and in contrast to retinal tissue, FKRP additionally accumulated in the nucleus of the 661W photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that fukutin and FKRP not only participate in the synthesis of O-mannosyl glycans added to &#945;-dystroglycan in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, but that they could also play a role, that remains to be established, in the nucleus of retinal neurons.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dystroglycanopathies (DGPs) are a group of minority congenital neuromuscular dystrophies caused by deficiencies in the complex process of O-mannosyl glycosylation of dystroglycan (DG). They are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases that are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and whose symptoms involve a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations mainly affecting the skeletal muscle and central nervous system (CNS), with the latter including the brain and retina [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently, these diseases have been jointly designated in the OMIM database under the term &#8220;Muscular dystrophies-dystroglycanopathies (congenital with brain and eye anomalies),&#8221; which are abbreviated as MDDGs.</p><p>DG is the main component of the so-called dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), a multiprotein assembly composed of peripheral and integral membrane proteins and responsible for linking the cytoskeleton of muscle and nerve cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of their resident tissue [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The DGC is thus crucial for the correct structure and function of muscle and nervous systems from early embryogenesis in mammals [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DG is a glycoprotein composed of two subunits: alpha (&#945;-DG), which is extracellular, and beta (&#946;-DG), which is transmembrane and cytoplasmic. These two polypeptides remain non-covalently linked and associated with the plasma membrane [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DG is widely distributed in a variety of cell types, and usually associated with basement membranes, such as muscle, nervous tissue, epithelial tissue and vascular endothelium [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The &#945;-DG polypeptide is heavily and heterogeneously glycosylated by the addition of N- and (especially) O-glycans to its central, mucin-like domain [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its O-linked glycan chains are essential for the interaction of &#945;-DG with other ECM proteins, such as laminin, agrin and perlecan in general [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], neurexin [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and slit [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] specifically in the brain, and pikachurin exclusively in the retina. The interaction between the latter and DG has been proven to be essential for the formation and function of ribbon synapses established at the outer plexiform layer (OPL) between photoreceptors (cones and rods) and their postsynaptic, bipolar and horizontal neurons [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interactions between DG and ECM proteins are also crucial for the proper formation by M&#252;ller glia of the inner limiting (basement) membrane separating the neural retina from the vitreous humor [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Retinal symptoms derived from the loss of &#945;-DG glycosylation may consequently involve chorioretinal atrophy, retinal dysplasia and detachment, and/or vitreoretinal dysgenesis [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A total of 18 genes have been hitherto identified in which mutations cause different types of DGPs with varying degrees of clinical severity. With the exception of <italic>DAG1</italic> (Gene ID 1605; OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=128239">128239</ext-link>), which codes for DG itself, most of these genes encode protein glycosyltransferases whose loss of function causes &#945;-DG hypoglycosylation and thereby affects its function as a receptor for its ECM ligands [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The nomenclature for these enzymes that was recently adopted by Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is used in this work. The first genetic alteration identified as causative of DGPs, namely Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), was detected in Japan as an ancestral founder mutation [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and was subsequently mapped on the <italic>FKTN</italic> gene (Gene ID 2218, OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=607440">607440</ext-link>), encoding the 461 amino-acid enzyme called fukutin [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thereafter, a significant number of non-Japanese patients with mutations in the <italic>FKTN</italic> gene have been reported, some with FCMD phenotype and others with more severe DGPs, such as Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) or muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], all of them designated as type MDDGA4 (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=253800">253800</ext-link>). However, mutations in <italic>FKTN</italic> can also cause milder DGPs that do not involve mental retardation, dubbed as types MDDGB4 (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=613152">613152</ext-link>) and MDDGC4 (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=611588">611588</ext-link>), the latter previously designated as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2M [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Soon thereafter, a gene encoding the 495 amino-acid enzyme called fukutin-related protein (FKRP; Gene ID 79147, OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=606596">606596</ext-link>) was identified [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which can also cause different forms of DGPs that are either severe with anomalies in the brain and eye (MDDGA5; OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=613153">613153</ext-link>), such as WWS or MEB [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], or milder with or without mental retardation, dubbed as types MDDGB5 (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=606612">606612</ext-link>) and MDDGC5 (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=607155">607155</ext-link>), the latter also known as LGMD type 2I [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Fukutin and FKRP proteins are structurally and functionally related glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the extension of the &#945;-DG O-mannosyl glycan core structure called M3, i.e., the phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide GalNAc(&#946;1&#8211;3)GlcNAc(&#946;1&#8211;4; P6)Man. This pathway has so far been identified only for specific O-mannose residues previously added by the POMT1/POMT2 heterodimer to Ser/Thr residues in the mucin-like domain of &#945;-DG, and involves the addition by the enzyme POMGNT2 of a molecule of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), covalently linked by a &#946;1&#8211;4 bond to the O-mannose residue, presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Next, the B3GALNT2 protein adds one unit of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), with subsequent phosphorylation at the 6-position of the O-mannose residue by the enzyme POMK [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. &#945;-DG is then thought to be transported to the Golgi complex, where fukutin and FKRP act to sequentially add to the GalNAc molecule two ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) units in tandem from cytidine-diphosphate-ribitol (CDP-Rbo) [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thereafter, the proteins products of other DGP-associated genes contribute to add to this tandem the so-called matriglycan polysaccharide, whose presence, and especially its number of repeats, is essential for the binding of &#945;-DG to its ECM ligands [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Fukutin and FKRP are believed to perform their Rbo5P transferase function in the Golgi complex, where they have been detected in human skeletal muscle cells [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and mouse liver [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To study the role of DGP-associated proteins in vivo, several mouse models have been generated and characterized, which exhibit null mutations in particular genes encoding glycosyltransferases acting on &#945;-DG [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These included chimeric knockout (KO) mice for the fukutin-encoding gene [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and knock-down mice for the gene encoding FKRP [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In all these models, a partial or total absence of &#945;-DG glycosylation has been unveiled, together with associated ocular structural and functional alterations resembling those existing in patients with DGPs. Nevertheless, the precise role of fukutin and FKRP proteins in the adult visual system is largely unknown, and their distribution pattern in the retina remains to be established. In this work, we have analyzed the expression of <italic>FKTN</italic> and <italic>FKRP</italic> at the mRNA and protein levels in the neural retina of several mammalian species and in cultured photoreceptors of the 661W cell line. Interestingly, in addition to being located in the ER and the Golgi complex, respectively, both fukutin and FKRP accumulate in the nucleus in this cell line, where they could play a hitherto unreported function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The adult mammalian species studied in this work included mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, strain C57BL/6J), rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, strain Sprague-Dawley), cows (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>), and cynomolgus monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>). All animal handling was performed in compliance with the rules set by the National Institutes of Health (USA), the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research, and the European Directive 2010/63/EU. Rodents were held at the Universidad de Alicante animal-care facility and euthanized upon CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Their eyes were enucleated and stored in RNAlater solution (Ambion; Austin, TX, USA). Bovine eyes were freshly obtained from the Alicante municipal slaughterhouse. Monkeys were kept as described [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] at the animal-care facility of the Universidad de Murcia (Spain), and their eyes were kindly donated by Dr. M.T. Herrero. All protocols and primate-handling procedures used were approved by the university bioethics research committee. Young adult monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine (10&#160;mg/kg, i.m.) and then administered a lethal injection of pentobarbital (50&#160;mg/kg, i.p.), and their eyeballs were immediately enucleated following sacrifice. All animal eyes were kept at &#8211;80&#176;C until the retinas were dissected for RNA or protein isolation. For immunohistochemistry, mouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (PB) for 1 h and then subjected to sucrose cryoprotection [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The 661W photoreceptor cell line was kindly provided by Dr. M.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, the fukutin and FKRP enzymes were detected in total protein extracts from the retina of all mammalian species analyzed, as well as from 661W photoreceptors. Fukutin migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 60&#160;kDa, corresponding to the size reported by other authors [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Regarding FKRP, it migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 55&#160;kDa, compatible with the canonical form of the protein in the different species. We next investigated the intracellular localization of fukutin and FKRP using protein extracts from the cytoplasm and nucleus of the adult mouse neural retina and 661W cell line. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, immunoblotting analysis revealed that fukutin was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the mouse retina, whereas FKRP was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, the two proteins were found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of 661W photoreceptors. By using specific antibodies against &#946;-tubulin III (an exclusively cytoplasmic protein) and lamins A and C (two exclusively nuclear proteins), we were able to evidence that in our hands, the fractionation procedure followed did not result in cross-contamination between the two subcellular fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since both fukutin and FKRP were found to be expressed in the mouse retina and 661W photoreceptors, we subsequently addressed their distribution pattern in retinal sections and cultured 661W cells by means of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In mouse cryostat sections immunostained with an antibody specific for fukutin, we found that this protein was located in different retinal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A,C</xref>), although it was mainly present in the inner segments (IS) of photoreceptors and the outer plexiform layer (OPL). We also observed a weaker immunoreactivity of fukutin in the outer nuclear (ONL) and inner plexiform (IPL) layers, as well as in the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers, where it accumulated in the nuclei of several cells, but without colocalizing with the DNA-binding dye, DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This analysis confirmed that in addition to the cytoplasm, fukutin was present in the nucleus of some retinal cell types, in keeping with the results obtained by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Yet, the cytoplasmic distribution pattern of fukutin did not resemble that of the Golgi complex, as could be expected (see above). Furthermore, when we performed a double immunostaining for fukutin and GM130, a structural protein of the Golgi widely used as a marker for this organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>), we did not observe colocalization, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E-G</xref>.

Subsequently, alternating Xyl and GlcA residues are repetitively appended to the tandem Rbo5P scaffold to constitute the so-called matriglycan, i.e., the &#945;-DG polysaccharide moiety directly involved in ligand binding [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

In this work, fukutin was detected by immunoblotting in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the adult mouse retina and of 661W cells, exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 60&#160;kDa. This was higher than the mass calculated from its amino acid sequence (54&#160;kDa) or that reported in the mammalian brain and muscle and in HeLa cells [<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], although consistent with the size reported by other authors in a wide list of human organs [<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and cell lines [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

At the protein level, FKRP has been found in human skeletal and cardiac muscle [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and in mouse liver [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as endogenously in a variety of established cell lines [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It follows that despite affecting mainly the brain and muscle, fukutin and FKRP are present in many other organs, where their function has not been addressed, including the retina, as shown in this work.</p><p>For both proteins, the results we have obtained by immunoblotting have been corroborated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in mouse retinal sections and 661W photoreceptors. In this light, fukutin was detected in the cytoplasm of cells in all nuclear layers of the mouse retina, additionally accumulating in the nucleus of particular cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). However, FKRP was found to be present as well in the cytoplasm of cells in all three retinal nuclear layers, but additionally in the OPL, and was excluded from the nucleus of all retinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Regarding 661W photoreceptors, the presence of fukutin and FKRP in both the cytoplasm and nucleus detected by immunoblotting was ascertained by immunocytochemistry in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, respectively).</p><p>We also evidenced a significant colocalization of fukutin with calreticulin in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) and with KDEL in 661W cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>), both two widely used ER markers. As well, we found colocalization of FKRP with the Golgi marker GM130 in both biological samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). On the other hand, no colocalization was seen between fukutin and GM130, or with FKRP with calreticulin or KDEL in either the retina or 661W cells. These results allow us to conclude that fukutin and FKRP are located in retinal cells, at least in part, in the ER and Golgi, respectively, at variance with the previous notion of both proteins residing in the Golgi, as reported for human skeletal muscle [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and mouse liver [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as endogenously in a wide variety of established cell lines [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="r65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In this context, it must be mentioned that fukutin has been detected in the ER, rather than in the Golgi, in cultures of human astrocytoma 1321N1 and cervical carcinoma HeLa cell lines [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Hence, a scenario can be envisioned in which, in retinal neurons and 661W photoreceptors, fukutin would attach in the ER the first unit of the phosphorylated pentose alcohol, Rbo5P, to the &#945;-DG core M3 glycan, and FKRP would subsequently act in the Golgi to link the second Rbo5P molecule. An ensuing addition to the tandem Rbo5P acceptor of the Xyl/GlcA repeat by LARGE and other enzymes in this organelle would then generate the functional receptor for &#945;-DG ECM ligands, i.e., the matriglycan structure [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a process that remains to be investigated in the retina. Modulation of the intracellular localization of fukutin and FKRP (i.e., ER versus Golgi) through tissue-dependent N-glycosylation has been suggested, based on their mislocalization being observed as a result of pathogenic mutations affecting particular sites of these proteins [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>-<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>In the mouse retina, both proteins were also visualized in the OPL as distributing in a dotted pattern, with fukutin colocalizing with calreticulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) and FKRP colocalizing with &#946;-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In this layer, they could be anchored to the presynaptic membrane of photoreceptors cells, or even secreted into the ECM of the synaptic cleft. This possibility cannot be ruled out since fukutin has been detected in the culture medium of COS-7 cells transfected with a human <italic>FKTN</italic> cDNA [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, FKRP is known to be secreted into the extracellular medium by means of exocytic vesicles formed by the Golgi in transfected CHO cells [<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. FKRP has also been reported in association with the DGC at the sarcolemma in the mouse, suggesting a new function for this protein at the skeletal muscle membrane [<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>In addition to their localization in the ER (fukutin) and Golgi complex (FKRP), we found that both fukutin and FKRP were located in the nuclear fraction of 661W photoreceptors, and fukutin as well in the nuclear fraction from the mouse retina, although at a higher abundancy in the cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). These results were corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy, thus revealing the presence of both proteins in the nucleus of 661W cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), and of fukutin also in the nucleus of several cells in the INL and GCL of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The nuclear concentration of these proteins in 661W photoreceptors could be attributable to their absence of normal cell polarity, which is derived from their lack of outer segments and interaction with RPE cells. This loss of polarity has been posited to cause misplacement of some proteins with respect to their normal location in the retina, as is the case for red/green and blue cone opsins [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the ceramide kinase-like protein, CERKL [<xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In addition, unlike photoreceptors in the retina, 661W is an immortalized cell line with an unlimited capacity for cell division [<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Yet, it must be emphasized that this is not the first time that DGP-associated proteins have been detected in the nucleus of given cell types or established cell lines. Indeed, we have recently reported the accumulation of POMGNT1 in the nucleus of 661W cells, where it colocalized with POMT1 and POMT2, and these two proteins in turn with euchromatin areas [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Fukutin has also been found to be present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of human 1321N1 and HeLa cell lines [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and of most neurons of the human adult brain, both excitatory and inhibitory, including the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, where it coexists with glycosylated &#945;-DG [<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Though highly speculative, the possibility thus exists that &#945;-DG or other nuclear proteins could act as a substrate for both fukutin and FKRP, as well as for other DGP-associated glycosyltransferases, as we have recently proposed [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Yet, it cannot be ruled out that fukutin and FKRP could play in the nucleus roles that still need to be unraveled, which may or not be related to &#945;-DG glycosylation, such as the modulation of cell proliferation, as suggested by other authors for fukutin [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and by our group for POMGNT1 [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This is an issue that merits further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are indebted to Dr. Mar&#237;a Trinidad Herrero (Departamento de Anatom&#237;a Humana y Psicobiolog&#237;a, Universidad de Murcia, Spain) for kindly providing us the monkey eyes used in this study, and Dr. Muayyad Al-Ubaidi (Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Houston, TX, USA) for providing us the 661W photoreceptor cell line.
