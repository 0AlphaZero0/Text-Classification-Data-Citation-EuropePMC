</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Posttranscriptional and translational regulation mechanisms mediated by small RNAs are endemic in both animals and plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on the difference of biogenesis and action, small RNAs can be divided into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) at a broad level [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs were small, non-coding RNAs generated from single-stranded precursors with hairpin structures, while siRNAs were generated from double-strand RNA precursors [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that miRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating diverse plant developmental processes by targeting mRNAs for translational repression, cleavage, or destabilization [3], including leaf morphogenesis [4], boundary formation/organ separation [5], root development [6], organ polarity [7], flower development [8], phase changes from vegetative growth to generative growth [8] and flowering [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Since the first identification of lin4 in Caenorhabditis elegans [10], a total of 21,643 miRNAs were identified from 168 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>More recently, a growing number of new miRNAs in plants have also been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 5500 genes encoding miRNAs have been annotated in Arabidopsis, rice and other plant species, belonging to 250 miRNA families (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>, miRBase Release 18.0). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Identification of comprehensive sets of miRNAs and other small RNAs in different plant species was a critical step to facilitate our understanding of regulatory mechanisms or networks for target genes [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Three major approaches have been used for miRNA discovery in plants: forward genetics, computational prediction of conserved miRNAs by searching for homologous sequences using ESTs and genomic sequences as well as traditional Sanger sequencing of the small RNA library [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Only a few miRNAs have been identified by forward genetic studies [5], the computation-based approach is mostly limited to the discovery of conserved miRNAs and was difficult to predict species-specific miRNAs; the small-scale traditional sequencing approach identifies mainly conserved miRNA, because newly evolved and species-specific miRNAs were often accumulated at a lower level and often missing from the datasets derived [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The recently developed deep sequencing methods provided a rapid way to identify and profile small RNA populations in different plants, mutants, tissues, and at different stages of development [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This strategy has been successfully applied to both model plants [14], [15] and non-model plants [12], [16], and revealed that some miRNA families were well-conserved across plant species, suggesting that the regulatory role of many miRNAs may be universal in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Using the deep sequencing method revealed many species-specific miRNAs and provided the genomic landscape of miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs were first identified as regulators of the juvenile-to-adult transition in Caenorhabditis elegans [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicated that miRNAs and other endogenous miRNAs also regulated developmental transitions in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Several miRNAs, such as miR156 and miR172, have been shown to affect flowering time when over-expressed in Arabidopsis [8], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of miR156 prolongs the expression of juvenile vegetative traits and delays flowering in both Arabidopsis and maize [18], whereas over-expression of miR172 in Arabidopsis accelerates flowering [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>MiR172 exhibits a similar temporal expression pattern in maize, where it targets Glossy15 (Gl15), a gene required for the expression of juvenile epidermal traits [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, woody plants and many annual plants show characteristic variation as they progress from a juvenile to a mature stage, a process known as phase change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Annual plants complete their life cycle in one year and initiate flowering only once, whereas most woody plants including most fruit crops have a long juvenile period, during which no reproductive development occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>How perennials woody plants undergo a long silence juvenile stage followed by repeated vegetative growth and flowering has been extensively studied in transcriptional study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, whether or how miRNAs repress woody plants flowering before transition has not been elucidated in post-transcriptional and translational regulator. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Citrus fruit is produced commercially for fresh fruit, juice, raisins, and transformed into high value-added products such as wines and spirits [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Flowering is an essential stage for fruit production, and thus it is important to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the flowering event for genetic improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In 1976, a spontaneous mutant derived from Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf with short juvenile phase, namely, precocious trifoliate orange (MT), was found in Yichang, Hubei province, China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Compared with 6 to 8 years of the wild-type trifoliate orange (WT), almost all of the seedlings germinated from the MT only have 1 to 2 years’ juvenile period, and 20% seedlings even flowered in the year after germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The MT seedlings can flower 2–3 times per year while the WT only once per year [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>So the MT was speculated to be a direct variant of the WT, which is an ideal material for studying floral induction and flowering molecular mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, transcriptional study including cDNA macroarray in combination with suppression subtraction hybridization was used to investigate gene expression changes in the MT, and a total of 368 differentially expressed genes were detected [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, comparative proteomic analyses were performed between the MT and its WT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>And the proteomic data, when considered in combination with transcriptional data, suggest that post-transcriptional regulations are involved in shaping the early flowering trait of the MT (Zhang et al., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, it remains largely unknown what kind of post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in the MT. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The study of miRNAs in citrus has been reported [16], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, in comparison with other woody plants such as Vitis vinifera and populus, the number of citrus miRNAs identified so far is still quite small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The deep sequencing study is well suited for the discovery of species-specific miRNAs expressed at low abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we describe here Solexa sequencing and analysis of small RNA transcriptome from the MT and its WT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Several million miRNAs were produced from four libraries for two genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A total of 216 miRNAs, known and novel, were identified based on either sequence homology or the secondary structure of their precursors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The annotation of the potential targets of differential miRNAs indicated that highly ranked genes those that are required in biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Our studies not only significantly increase the number of miRNAs in citrus, but also provide useful information for miRNAs that regulate citrus growth and development processes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, characterization of the vital roles of miRNAs play in plant development is an active research field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Although many studies have demonstrated that plant miRNAs function as important regulators in environmental stress tolerance, more reports indicated that plant miRNAs were also involved in development and morphogenesis processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing of the small RNA transcriptome yields an incredible amount of data, from which we can not only determine known miRNAs, but also successfully explore novel miRNAs with high accuracy and efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported on miRNAs from other economically important tree crops by deep sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>More recently, deep sequencing was used to analyze a sRNA library generated from Poncirus trifoliata flowers and fruit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three sequences of 42 highly conserved miRNA families and 10 novel miRNAs were identified based on citrus EST database [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Likewise, Xu et al. (2010) constructed sRNA libraries from fruit of a red flesh bud sport and its wild type in sweet orange. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing identified 85 known miRNAs (48 families) and 12 novel miRNAs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Several sequencings of small RNA libraries from different grapevine cultivars or tissues have been also reported in recent years [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>For example, Pantaleo et al. (2010) used deep sequencing, computational and molecular methods to identify, profile, and describe 40 known miRNA families and 21 novel miRNA candidates in grapevine tissues [54]; Wang et al (2012) identified 72 new potential miRNAs and 34 known but non-conserved miRNAs by deep sequencing of short RNAs from Amur grape flowers and fruits [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>In a separate study, a total of 130 conserved grapevine miRNA belonging to 28 miRNA families were validated, other 80 unconserved miRNAs including 72 novel potential and 8 known but unconserved ones were found by deep sequencing [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>However, there was a relatively large number of citrus miRNAs compared with grapevine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the number of miRNA was significantly fewer based on EST database than genome-wide analysis by deep sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Thus, the recent release of the genome sequence will dramatically enhance the efficiency of discover new miRNAs in citrus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>In this study, the use of Solexa sequencing technology was efficient to identify 216 known and novel miRNAs of trifoliate orange base on citrus genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>These miRNAs were identified from four different libraries from precursors with stem-loop secondary structures that also map to the citrus genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>They were detected from the MT and WT libraries and were characterized as following: detected for the first time, already detected in some plant species, conserved in citrus, or a variant of a known miRNA (isoform). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>From these analyses, we found 75 novel miRNAs that had not been detected before, 36 families that had already been detected in Citrus sinensis, 67 trifoliate orange-specific miRNAs and 24 conserved miRNAs in other plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Previous studies validated the conserved miRNAs based on homology to known miRNAs in miRBase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>However, as opposed to some studies that only blast the candidate to the known miRNA mature sequence, our identifications were determined by precursor sequence folding and verification of the genuine hairpin structures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Both miRNAs and miRNA*s are generated from step-loop hairpin structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>It has been widely accepted that after processing from precursors, the functional strand of the short double-stranded RNA duplex will be retained as miRNAs, whereas their complementary miRNA* sequences will be quickly degraded [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs are stable and participate in translational repression or cleavage of mRNA by binding or anchoring to the coding region of mRNA sequences [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Khvorova et al inferred from the considerably low abundance of miRNA*s that these strands are typically destroyed when released from pre-miRNA stem [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in most cases, the abundance of miRNAs is much higher than that of their corresponding miRNA*s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>In this study, the low expression levels of miRNA*s sequences, such as csi-miR162*, csi-miR166e*, and csi-miR172a*, further support the miRNA synthesis hypothesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Two arms of a single hairpin, giving rise to RNA function isolation by different sequences, may associate with distinct biological activities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Some highly conserved miRNA families such as miR156/157, miR167 and miR172 families were sequenced more than ten thousands or even one hundred thousands times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>These highly conserved miRNAs may represent a relationship between evolutionary conservation and expression abundance [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The other way around, some miRNA families that are less conserved or even species-specific have very low abundance in two genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>From an evolutionary view, these miRNAs play a role in establishing and maintaining phenotypic diversity between different groups of organisms [57], [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that the conserved miRNAs are responsible for control of the basic cellular and developmental pathways common to most eukaryotes whereas the non-conserved miRNAs are involved in regulation of the species-specific pathways and functions [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>In addition to the identification of conserved miRNAs, 75 novel miRNAs were also identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Only one member was identified in each species-specific miRNA family and the read number for each novel miRNA was much lower than that for the conserved miRNAs except Novel56. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The low abundance of novel miRNAs might suggest that they in their turn play rather specific roles in response to a particular growth condition or a particular developmental stage [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In addition, deep sequencing technologies in combination with bioinformatics analysis enabled us to profile the miRNA expression patterns for further miRNA functional insights, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and diverse physiological pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Second, comparing miRNA expression profiles at different developmental stages, we found significant differences in miRNA regulation patterns, with 22 conserved miRNAs altered expression patterns between the MT and its WT at juvenile and adult stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>All almost trifoliate orange-specific miRNAs (including known and novel miRNAs) had low read counts comparison with conserved miRNAs in this study, there was no significant difference on miRNAs profile between the MT and the WT for most miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>There was one possible explanation why only a small number of miRNAs showed significant differences in two genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Because the MT and its WT have nearly the same morphology except flowering habit [21], molecular evaluation on DNA level using a number of AFLP markers produced no polymorphism between the MT and its WT, indicating an isogenic background between them [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believed that a small number of miRNAs or specific flowering-related genes from the MT (these miRNAs and genes may be key regulators controlling flowering by activating or repressing numerous flowering related genes) may be control the early flowering process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed miRNAs obtained can serve as a basis for further identification of the regulation roles of phase transition in citrus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>More recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice and other plant species target transcripts encoding proteins involved in diverse physiological processes [61], among which a set of miRNAs predominantly targeted transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Many known transcription and post-transcriptional regulatory genes were found in our library, and some known transcription factors related to flowering regulation were also found, including NAC domain transcription factor, ring zinc finger, squamosa promoter binding protein, and MYB transcription factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>NAC domain proteins were a class of transcription factors known to control multiple processes in plants, including the development of flower organ primordium [62] and flowering time [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Many (putative) zinc-finger transcription factors have also been implicated in flower development [64], flowering time [65], and light-regulated morphogenesis [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Other target genes include those encoding o-fucosyltransferase family protein, disease resistance protein family, FAR1-related sequence, LRR and NB-ARC domains-containing disease resistance protein and protein of unknown function, suggesting that trifoliate orange miRNAs were involved in a broad range of physiological functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>It would be an interesting area to identify the functions of these predicted target genes in trifoliate orange. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was hypothesized that a complementary site in the coding region of an mRNA may lead to the cleavage of the target, whereas target sites located in 3 UTRs might attenuate translation (Bartel, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this view, trifoliate orange miRNAs that target ORFs have largely been shown to be involved in the cleavage of target mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>A signature of an mRNA with a target site cleaved by a miRNA-guided process was a decrease in the RT-PCR amplification of any fragment that contained a region which was upstream of the target site [34]. NAC4 and SPL6 mRNA may be the potential targets for Novel29 and Novel56 by RA-PCR approach, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>The RA-PCR technique for monitoring miRNA-guided cleavage of mRNAs had an advantage of including control reactions in the same experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>However, RA-PCR also may produce uncertainties in data interpretation as a result of the presence of additional primer-binding sites, self-priming caused by RNA secondary structures, or unusual patterns of mRNA degradation [67]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Plant miRNAs have been reported as involving in morphology and flowering time [68], [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="?"><plain>Are miRNAs the regulators in those processes? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Although extensive experimentation would be needed to answer this question, at least the identity of the possibly novel miRNAs in this paper gives some potential gene targets for further investigation of the molecular basis of the regulation of growth and development in trifoliate orange. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>For example, molecular genetic analyses of vegetative phase change in maize and Arabidopsis have since revealed that miR156 plays a particularly important role in this transition [17], [70], [71], miR156 is expressed at very high levels during the juvenile phase and declines in abundance during vegetative phase change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of miR156 prolongs the expression of juvenile traits, whereas loss of miR156 activity eliminates these traits, demonstrating that miR156 is both necessary and sufficient for the juvenile phase [68], [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>MiR172 has also been implicated in the regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity in both maize and Arabidopsis [8], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Aukerman et al (2003) demonstrated that miR172 causes early flowering and disrupts the specification of floral organ identity when over-expressed in Arabidopsis [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>More recently, Song et al. (2010a) analyzed miR172 and miR156 from trifoliate orange by RACE and verified their expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Expression profiles of miRNAs indicated that the regulation mechanisms of these miRNAs were conserved in citrus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that miR156 decreases during phase development in Arabidopsis [46], whereas miR172 increases [47], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>In this study, to understand the role of miRNAs in the floral transition, the dynamic expression of twelve miRNAs during phase change and self-pruning process was monitored by real-time PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The fluctuation in miR156 and miR172 expression was quite significant compared with other miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, miR156 and miR172 were expressed in inverse patterns, consistent with previous reports on the two miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that miR156 and miR172 not only serves as a master regulator of vegetative phase change, but as a molecular marker for this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>In addition, Wang et al. (2011) also elucidated the role of miR156 to decide the age of branch at different position and make sure the mature branch to produce the fruits [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>It reveals that self-pruning and aging of branch were both important processes for the floral initiation in tree and may share some similar regulatory mechanism among them. </plain></SENT>
