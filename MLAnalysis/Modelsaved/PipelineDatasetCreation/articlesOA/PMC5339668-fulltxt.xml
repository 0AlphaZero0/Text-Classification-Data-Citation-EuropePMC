TSC patients with autism display impairments in white matter integrity. Similarly, mice lacking neuronal <italic>Tsc1</italic> have a hypomyelination phenotype. However, the mechanisms that underlie these phenotypes remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal TSC1/2 orchestrates a program of oligodendrocyte maturation through the regulated secretion of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). We characterize oligodendrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. We find that neuron-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion results in an increase in CTGF secretion that non&#8211;cell autonomously stunts oligodendrocyte development and decreases the total number of oligodendrocytes. Genetic deletion of CTGF from neurons, in turn, mitigates the TSC-dependent hypomyelination phenotype. These results show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in neurons regulates CTGF production and secretion, revealing a paracrine mechanism by which neuronal signaling regulates oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in TSC. This study highlights the role of mTOR-dependent signaling between neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the regulation of myelin and identifies an additional therapeutic avenue for this disease.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">5P30HD018655</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">W81XWH-13-1-0040</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006823</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant, multisystem disorder caused by loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 function (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Sahin, 2011</xref>). TSC affects 1/6,000 newborns worldwide and involves multiple organs including the brain, skin, eyes, kidneys, heart, and lungs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Crino et al., 2006</xref>). TSC patients have a high prevalence of epilepsy (&#8764;90%), intellectual disability and autism (&#8764;50%), sleep disruption, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Han and Sahin, 2011</xref>). Neuropathological findings in TSC include cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">DiMario, 2004</xref>).</p><p>TSC1 and TSC2 proteins bind to each other to form a complex that regulates protein synthesis and cell size (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kwiatkowski and Manning, 2005</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that one of the hallmarks of the disease is the presence of giant cells in the brain, particularly within cortical tubers. A key function of the TSC1/2 complex is to inhibit Rheb, the <italic>Ras homologue enriched in brain</italic> GTPase, which targets the serine-threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of protein synthesis. mTOR kinase functions in two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which are defined by distinct binding partners (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Manning, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>). mTORC1 controls protein homeostasis and is constituted by mTOR, raptor, PRAS40, and mLT8. mTORC1 activity is responsive to the inhibitor rapamycin. mTORC2 controls cellular shape by modulating actin function and contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8, and mSIN1 (mammalian stress-activated protein kinase&#8211;interacting protein 1). Inhibition of this complex requires prolonged rapamycin treatment (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>). Without the functional TSC1/2 complex, mTORC1 is hyperactive, resulting in disinhibited protein synthesis and subsequent cell growth (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The pathophysiological basis of seizures, behavioral disorders, and autism remains largely unknown. Neuronal abnormalities have been considered the dominant basis of TSC neuropathology. However, accumulating evidence also implicates nonneuronal cells, for instance astrocytes, in the control of neuronal function (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Uhlmann et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, white matter (WM) abnormalities in TSC have received surprisingly little attention. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated abnormal WM microstructures in patients with TSC that have autism compared with TSC patients without autism (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting WM pathology. This is corroborated by a mouse model of TSC in which neuronal loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> renders a strong hypomyelination phenotype (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Meikle et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have used oligodendrocyte-specific knockout mouse models of <italic>Raptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> to investigate the role of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in myelination (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bercury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these studies, mTORC1 in oligodendrocytes demonstrates a more prominent role than mTORC2 in promoting initiation of myelination, myelin thickness by controlling lipogenesis, and translation of myelin proteins (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to abatement of mTOR pathway activity, the effect of hyperactivation of mTORC1 in oligodendrocytes was assessed in oligodendrocyte-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Tsc2</italic> knockout mouse models. Surprisingly, both inactivation and hyperactivation of mTORC1 through loss of <italic>raptor</italic> and loss of <italic>Tsc1/2</italic>, respectively, resulted in a hypomyelination phenotype (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carson et al., 2015</xref>). These observations highlight that a delicate balance of mTOR activity in oligodendrocytes is required for proper myelination.</p><p>Complementary to these findings, our work using a mouse model that lacks <italic>Tsc1</italic> only in neurons also showed a hypomyelination phenotype (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Meikle et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in addition to the oligodendroglial mTOR activity, the non&#8211;cell autonomous effects of mTOR could also regulate myelination. Here, we show that, both in vitro and in vivo, the loss of functional TSC1/2 in neurons results in a block in oligodendrocyte development and myelination, respectively. We find that this process is mediated by neuronal connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; also known as CCN2). CTGF is highly expressed and secreted from the neurons lacking TSC1/2 and blocks the development of oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of CTGF in <italic>Tsc</italic>-deficient neurons by demonstrating decreases in the levels of serum response factor (SRF), which is the transcriptional repressor of <italic>Ctgf</italic> (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stritt et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, we show that myelination is improved by genetic ablation of <italic>Ctgf</italic> in neurons that also lack <italic>Tsc1</italic>. Electron microscopy (EM) data suggest that this rescue is caused by the rescue of number of myelinated axons, rather than changes in thickness of myelin. Collectively, our data show that loss of TSC1/2, and thus mTOR hyperactivity, in neurons results in a block of oligodendrocyte development and hypomyelination, uncovering a non&#8211;cell autonomous mechanism of mTOR in myelination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in neurons alone results in hypomyelination in vivo</title><p>We have previously demonstrated hypomyelination in the <italic>Tsc1<sup>c&#8722;</sup>SynICre<sup>+</sup></italic> mouse brain, which lacks both alleles of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in neurons and one allele of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in all other cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Meikle et al., 2007</xref>). In these mice, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression was reduced throughout the brain from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P21, suggesting a failure of myelination, as opposed to a demyelinating process (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Meikle et al., 2007</xref>). In the current study, we compared the myelin-specific marker MBP staining in an alternative conditional knockout model of <italic>Tsc1</italic> that lacks <italic>Tsc1</italic> in all neurons but still expresses wild-type levels of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in all other cell types, <italic>Tsc1<sup>cc</sup>SynICre<sup>+</sup></italic>(mutant). Compared with the control <italic>Tsc1<sup>ww</sup>SynICre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice at P21, mutant mice showed lower MBP levels. This difference was reversed in both gray matter (GM; cortex) and WM (corpus callosum) by treating mutants with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, suggesting that mTOR hyperactivity in neurons suppresses myelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#8211;C</xref>). Moreover, mutant mice displayed fewer CC1<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in both the GM and WM; this difference was reversible by treatment of mutants with rapamycin (Fig. S1, A and B). In addition to the cortex and corpus callosum, we assessed the degree of myelination by MBP staining in other regions of the brain, such as striatum and internal capsule, and found that hypomyelination in mutant brains occurs in those regions as well (Fig. S1, C and D). Finally, we checked whether the heterozygous mutants show a similar hypomyelination phenotype. Compared with the controls, neither the MBP intensity nor the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells was different in the heterozygous mutants (Fig. S1, E&#8211;H). These results suggest that the loss of both alleles of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in neurons results in hypomyelination and a reduction in the number of mature oligodendrocytes in an mTOR-dependent manner.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of neuronal Tsc1 results in hypomyelination.</bold> (A) Representative images of MBP staining of brain sections from control (<italic>Tsc1<sup>ww</sup>SynICre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 3), mutant (<italic>Tsc1<sup>cc</sup>SynICre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 4), and rapamycin-treated mutant (<italic>n</italic> = 4) mice at P21.

We observed no differences in Olig2<sup>+</sup> and NG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte numbers between control and the mutants at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#8211;D</xref>). However, at P14, the number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes was decreased, whereas the number of NG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes was increased in the mutants compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E&#8211;H</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we treated cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) with conditioned medium (CM) from cortical neurons transduced with a viral construct expressing a <italic>Tsc2</italic> shRNA (knockdown [KD]) and compared them with control shRNA&#8211;transduced cortical neurons.

Given the effect of <italic>Tsc</italic> deficiency in rat cortical neurons, we asked whether CTGF levels are also elevated in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8211;derived human neurons from TSC patients. We generated iPSC lines from fibroblasts collected from TSC patients and unaffected family members to use as controls and differentiated these cells into neurons (Fig. S2, I&#8211;N). Compared with unaffected controls, iPSC-derived neurons from fibroblasts of TSC patients showed elevated levels of CTGF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>Ctgf</italic> mRNA and protein are up-regulated in <italic>Tsc</italic>-deficient neurons in vitro. Recently, in two epilepsy-associated pathologies, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and TSC, myelin deficiencies caused by decreased number of oligodendrocytes and insufficient oligodendrocyte maturation have been observed (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Scholl et al., 2016</xref>). Then, we asked whether CTGF is expressed in human brains with epilepsy. For this analysis, we used epileptic tissue resected from patients with FCD, from TSC patients, and from patients with epilepsy but no FCD or TSC. The Western blot analysis in these brain samples showed that CTGF is expressed in all samples (Fig. S2 O).</p><p>CTGF expression has been used as a marker for subplate neurons in both humans and in rodents (Fig. S3 A; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Heuer et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we used immunostaining to evaluate CTGF expression in this region in brain sections from mutant and control mice to evaluate the effect of neuronal <italic>Tsc1</italic> ablation in vivo. We analyzed the expression of CTGF in P7, P14, and P21 mice. We found the number of cells in the subplate region expressing CTGF above a fixed threshold intensity was not changed between controls and mutants at P7 (Fig. S3, B and C). However, at P14, we observed a significant increase in CTGF expression, which was elevated at P21, in the mutant brains compared with controls (Fig. S3, D and E; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, I and J</xref>), and CTGF-positive cells expressed higher levels of protein in the mutants (enlarged images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref>). Increased CTGF expression was reversed by rapamycin treatment, indicating that this process is mTOR dependent in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, I and J</xref>; and enlarged images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism that regulates CTGF expression in <italic>Tsc</italic>-deficient neurons, we chose to evaluate the role of SRF. Previous studies show that the SRF regulates the expression CTGF in different cell types (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Muehlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Haak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Angelini et al., 2015</xref>). Neurons lacking SRF have higher expression of CTGF and thus block the maturation of oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stritt et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the levels of SRF both in our mutant mice and in primary cortical neurons lacking <italic>Tsc2</italic>. Both SRF protein and transcript levels were decreased in <italic>Tsc2</italic> KD neurons compared with the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#8211;C</xref>). In addition, we examined the transcript levels of other targets of SRF that included <italic>Egr1</italic> and <italic>Cyr61</italic>. SRF functions as a transcription activator of <italic>Egr1</italic> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), whereas it suppresses the transcription of <italic>Cyr61</italic> (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stritt et al., 2009</xref>), which is also in the same CCN family of proteins with CTGF (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jun and Lau, 2011</xref>). Consistent with these functions, we found that, in <italic>Tsc2</italic> KD cortical neurons, both <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> transcripts are decreased, whereas <italic>Cyr61</italic> transcript is increased as <italic>Ctgf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

(2010)</xref> previously reported that the loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in oligodendrocytes, which results in hyperactivity of mTOR in oligodendrocytes, triggers myelination, and treatment of <italic>Pten</italic> adult mice with rapamycin (P43&#8211;P95) reduces the degree of myelination in the mutants. Presumably, the effect of rapamycin is directly on the Pten-deficient oligodendrocytes in this system. In contrast, we performed the rapamycin treatment between P7 and P21 and observed enhanced myelination in neuronal <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockout mice. In our experiments, the time of rapamycin treatment (P7 to P21) and spatiotemporal expression of CTGF in subplate neurons (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Heuer et al., 2003</xref>) coincide with the development of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes. Rapamycin treatment during this period leads to enhanced myelination. This may be explained by the role of an axonal myelination signal (CTGF) that regulates the mTOR activity in oligodendrocytes in addition to the effect of rapamycin on oligodendrocytes. CTGF has been shown to bind to and antagonize insulin-like growth factor and stimulate oligodendrocyte development and, thus, can indirectly block the activation of the mTOR pathway in oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Stritt et al., 2009</xref>). Rapamycin treatment may mitigate the expression and thus secretion of CTGF from neurons. The extracellular CTGF can no longer interfere with IGF1 binding to its receptor on oligodendrocytes. This, in turn, activates the Akt&#8211;mTOR pathway in oligodendrocytes, which enhances myelination. Together, these studies highlight the complexity of regulation of myelination by different signaling pathways (Pten vs. TSC1/2) and different cell types (neurons vs. oligodendrocytes) and at different times of development.</p><p>Our results show that the double knockout of <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> in neurons improved the hypomyelination phenotype observed in the <italic>Tsc1</italic>-mutant mice in both the GM and WM as assessed by MBP and MAG immunostaining. However, in the WM, the total number of oligodendrocytes (Olig2<sup>+</sup>) was similar in both <italic>Tsc1</italic>- and double-mutant mice, suggesting that <italic>Ctgf</italic> loss does not rescue the number of oligodendrocytes. Moreover, in the WM and lateral ventricle of double mutants, we did not observe a rescue in the number of CC1<sup>+</sup> and NG2<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that neuronal <italic>Tsc1</italic> loss results in a reduction in CC1<sup>+</sup> cells and an increase in NG2<sup>+</sup> cells. Therefore, it is likely that the impact of neuronal <italic>Tsc1</italic> loss in vivo is on both the oligodendrocyte cell number and the ability of these cells to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes (CC1<sup>+</sup>). However, in the WM, double knockout of <italic>Ctgf</italic> with <italic>Tsc1</italic> rescues neither the total (Olig2<sup>+</sup>) nor the mature (CC1<sup>+</sup>) oligodendrocyte number. Nonetheless, we find that <italic>Ctgf</italic> loss does enhance myelination as assessed by MBP and MAG immunostaining and EM. As revealed by EM, the number of myelinated axons increases by the loss of <italic>Ctgf</italic>, whereas the myelin thickness decreases. It is possible that the oligodendrocytes now generate more internodes per cell and that each oligodendrocyte is able to wrap more axons. In the WM, the loss of <italic>Ctgf</italic> affects the number of oligodendrocyte processes but not their ability to differentiate. The rescue of MBP and MAG intensity in the double mutants is therefore not caused by the formation of a thicker myelin sheath; rather, it may be caused by the increased number of processes and, thus, myelinated axons. This remains to be investigated further at the cellular level.</p><p>We observed that the loss of <italic>Ctgf</italic> affects the number of oligodendrocytes in WM and GM somewhat differently. Compared with the GM, the intensity of MBP in WM increases more profoundly. In addition, the number of oligodendrocytes (Olig2<sup>+</sup> and CC1<sup>+</sup>) is rescued in the GM but not in the WM. These region-specific differences in oligodendrocyte numbers and MBP intensity might be the result of the region-specific expression of CTGF. As CTGF is predominantly expressed in the subplate neurons, which reside in the cortical WM, the WM oligodendrocytes might be affected more profoundly than the GM oligodendrocytes. Although the subplate neurons reside in the deeper layer of cortex, they can project into layer 4 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Allendoerfer and Shatz, 1994</xref>). This might explain why we observe hypomyelination not only in WM but also in the GM.</p><p>In our in vitro oligodendrocyte maturation assay, we observed that a block in oligodendrocyte differentiation by addition of <italic>Tsc2</italic> KD CM and depletion of CTGF from the medium improves the differentiation. Moreover, we found that the in-vitro effect of CTGF is dose dependent. In vivo, we also observed an effect of CTGF on oligodendrocyte number, which we did not observe in vitro. This difference may be because of the growth factor&#8211;rich conditions we used to grow oligodendrocytes in culture. Abundance of growth factors in culture may mask an effect on oligodendrocyte survival or proliferation. In addition, for the in vitro dose-response experiments, we used a recombinant full-length human CTGF; however, in-vivo proteolytic processing of CTGF might yield to different modules (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Steffen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2002</xref>). Ultimately, these different forms might affect the oligodendrocyte development and/or process formation in distinct ways.</p><p>Furthermore, there might be additional inhibitory factors in vivo and/or compensatory factors in vitro that may play roles in oligodendrocyte development. For instance, from our microarray data, we found that the mRNA level of contactin-1 (<italic>cntn1</italic>), an axon&#8211;glia interaction protein, is decreased (unpublished data). Although such additional factors and their effects remain to be discovered, our data suggest that the neuronal CTGF is a strong determinant of myelination in vivo. Future studies of the downstream effects of CTGF on oligodendrocytes and identification of the protein modules within CTGF that are responsible for regulation of oligodendrocyte development will be a major goal for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Our study provides the first description of a possible molecular mechanism that could underlie the aberrant WM microstructure in TSC patients. The non&#8211;cell autonomous effect of CTGF should also be investigated in other diseases associated with myelination deficits such as periventricular leukomalacia and cerebral palsy, as well in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s08"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s09"><title>Mouse models</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with animal protocols approved by the Animal Research Committee at Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital.

Embryonic stem&#8211;like colonies formed after 3 wk of transfection, and the observed embryonic stem&#8211;like colonies were handpicked and transferred onto mouse feeder cells to generate iPSC lines. The iPSCs were maintained on feeder cells (Globalstem) in human embryonic stem media (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mM &#946;-mercaptoethanol, 1&#215; nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 20% knockout serum replacement (Invitrogen), and 10 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen). Established iPSC cells were maintained in STEMPRO human embryonic stem cell culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 ng/ml bFGF using Geltrex lactose dehydrogenase elevating virus&#8211;free human embryonic stem cell&#8211;qualified Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Matrix (Invitrogen) and passaged using dispase (Invitrogen). All the iPSC lines showed pluripotency (qRT-PCR and immunostaining; Fig. S2, I&#8211;N). Established iPSC lines (TSC2 patient and control) were differentiated into neurons following the dual SMAD inhibition method. Karyotyping was done at the CytoGenomics Core Laboratory in Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and showed normal karyotyping (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimi-Fakhari et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Neuronal differentiation</title><p>Human iPSCs were dissociated into single cells with Accutase and seeded on a Geltrex-coated 6-well plate.

After dissection, brains were postfixed in the same fixative overnight. Then, samples were washed with 0.15 M cacodylate buffer and stained en bloc in 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer for 5 h, washed with water, and then stained in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 2 h. Then, samples were dehydrated in graded alcohols and propylene oxide and embedded in TAAB 812 resin (Canemco-Marivac). Blocks were kept for 48 h at 60&#176;C to complete polymerization. Both semi- and ultrathin sections were prepared with Diatome Histo and Diatome Ultra 45&#176; diamond knives, respectively, on an Ultramicrotome (UC7; Leica Biosystems). The digital images were taken with a charged-coupled device camera (2k; AMT) mounted on a transmission electron microscope (G2 Spirit BioTWIN; Tecnai).</p><p>At least 30 images were taken for each brain sample at a magnification of 9,300&#215;. The total number of unmyelinated and myelinated axons was counted regardless of their diameters. The images were analyzed by ImageJ. The g-ratio was calculated by inner area divided by outer area of the myelinated axon. The circularity was determined by ImageJ, and only the axons having circularity &gt;0.6 were used in calculations. Calculations and graphs were done in Excel and R, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows reduced myelination in Tsc1-mutant but not in heterozygous brains.
