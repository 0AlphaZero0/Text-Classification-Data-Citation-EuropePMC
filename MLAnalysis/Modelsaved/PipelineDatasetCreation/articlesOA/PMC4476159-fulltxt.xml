In flowering plants, the short interfering (si)RNAs that direct transcriptional silencing are abundant and subfunctionalization has led to specialized machinery responsible for synthesis and action of these small RNAs. In particular, plants possess polymerase (Pol) IV and Pol V, multi-subunit homologs of the canonical DNA-dependent RNA Pol II, as well as specialized members of the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RDR), Dicer-like (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) families. Together these enzymes are required for production and activity of Pol IV-dependent (p4-)siRNAs, which trigger RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) at homologous sequences. p4-siRNAs accumulate highly in developing endosperm, a specialized tissue found only in flowering plants, and are rare in nonflowering plants, suggesting that the evolution of flowers might coincide with the emergence of specialized RdDM machinery. Through comprehensive identification of RdDM genes from species representing the breadth of the land plant phylogeny, we describe the ancient origin of Pol IV and Pol V, suggesting that a nearly complete and functional RdDM pathway could have existed in the earliest land plants. We also uncover innovations in these enzymes that are coincident with the emergence of seed plants and flowering plants, and recent duplications that might indicate additional subfunctionalization. Phylogenetic analysis reveals rapid evolution of Pol IV and Pol V subunits relative to their Pol II counterparts and suggests that duplicates were retained and subfunctionalized through Escape from Adaptive Conflict. Evolution within the carboxy-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit is particularly striking, where illegitimate recombination facilitated extreme sequence divergence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>small RNA-directed DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>RNA Polymerase IV</kwd><kwd>RNA Polymerase V</kwd><kwd>Escape from Adaptive Conflict</kwd><kwd>Gene duplication</kwd><kwd>RNA Silencing</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotes encode three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III) for transcription of ribosomal, messenger, and transfer RNAs. Plants contain two additional polymerases, Pol IV and V, which are specialized for transcriptional gene silencing via RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) (<xref rid="msv060-B21" ref-type="bibr">Herr et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kanno et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B48" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B49" ref-type="bibr">Pontier et al. 2005</xref>). Pol IV and V are related to Pol II and likely arose through subfunctionalization of silencing activities performed by Pol II in fungi and metazoans (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B50" ref-type="bibr">Ream et al. 2013</xref>). However, Pol IV and V might also have novel activities based within the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is unrelated to that of Pol II.</p><p>Pol IV initiates the synthesis of short interfering (si)RNAs from thousands of repetitive genomic loci, including all classes of transposons (<xref rid="msv060-B44" ref-type="bibr">Mosher et al. 2008</xref>). Pol IV physically associates with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2, which uses the Pol IV transcript as a template to generate double-stranded RNA (<xref rid="msv060-B18" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al. 2012</xref>). This double-stranded RNA is cleaved by the Dicer-like endonuclease DCL3, resulting in characteristic 24-nt siRNAs (<xref rid="msv060-B66" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al. 2004</xref>). Pol IV-dependent (p4-)siRNAs integrate into three ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins (AGO4, AGO6, and AGO9) (<xref rid="msv060-B19" ref-type="bibr">Havecker et al. 2010</xref>), and the AGO/p4-siRNA complex is hypothesized to associate with specific genomic regions through Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing between the p4-siRNA and nascent, noncoding transcripts generated by Pol V (<xref rid="msv060-B63" ref-type="bibr">Wierzbicki et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="msv060-B64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). AGO4 physically associates with a WG/GW platform in the CTD of Pol V, presumably to aid AGO4 recruitment to chromatin (<xref rid="msv060-B34" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B13" ref-type="bibr">El-Shami et al. 2007</xref>). AGO/p4-siRNA/Pol V complex assembles additional proteins to initiate DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing (<xref rid="msv060-B38" ref-type="bibr">Matzke and Mosher 2014</xref>).</p><p>In angiosperms (flowering plants), p4-siRNAs are the most abundant class in the small RNA transcriptome, comprising up to 90% of the mass and 99% of the complexity in some tissues (<xref rid="msv060-B20" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B31" ref-type="bibr">Kasschau et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B44" ref-type="bibr">Mosher et al. 2008</xref>). p4-siRNAs are abundant in all tissues, but are particularly prevalent in the developing endosperm, where they accumulate predominantly from matrigenic chromosomes (<xref rid="msv060-B43" ref-type="bibr">Mosher et al. 2009</xref>). This observation suggests that p4-siRNAs might mediate interactions or facilitate conflict between the matrigenic and patrigenic genomes in the endosperm (<xref rid="msv060-B42" ref-type="bibr">Mosher 2010</xref>).</p><p>Twenty-three nucleotide siRNAs capable of targeting DNA methylation to repetitive elements are present in moss (<xref rid="msv060-B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al. 2008</xref>), suggesting that small RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing is conserved throughout the land plant lineage. However, in moss these siRNAs are at low levels compared with 21 nt siRNAs (<xref rid="msv060-B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al. 2008</xref>), indicating that 24 nt siRNA expression is minimal or limited to a subset of tissues in nonflowering plants. Among sampled gymnosperms, there are conflicting reports of the presence of 24 nt siRNAs. Initially determined to be absent from conifers (<xref rid="msv060-B11" ref-type="bibr">Dolgosheina et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B41" ref-type="bibr">Morin et al. 2008</xref>), recent publications identified 24 nt siRNAs in Chinese fir (<italic>Cunninghamia lanceolata</italic>) (<xref rid="msv060-B62" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al. 2012</xref>), Japanese larch (<italic>Larix leptolepis</italic>) (<xref rid="msv060-B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>), and Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>) (<xref rid="msv060-B46" ref-type="bibr">Nystedt et al. 2013</xref>). In these species, 24 nt siRNAs were found only in reproductive tissues or samples containing reproductive tissues. The limited production of 24 nt siRNAs in nonflowering plants indicates limited activity of Pol IV and Pol V in these species relative to angiosperms. Combined with the prevalence of p4-siRNAs in the endosperm (a tissue found only in angiosperms), this observation suggests that the evolution of an endosperm might coincide with changes in Pol IV/V function and/or structure.</p><p>Each RNA polymerase is a large holoenzyme complex composed of at least 12 subunits (<xref rid="msv060-B51" ref-type="bibr">Ream et al. 2009</xref>). Some subunits are shared by all five eukaryotic polymerases, while others are uniquely incorporated into a single polymerase and presumably grant functional specificity to the enzyme (<xref rid="msv060-B24" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B32" ref-type="bibr">Lahmy et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B51" ref-type="bibr">Ream et al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="msv060-B50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B17" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al. 2014</xref>). Specific subunits of Pol IV and V (named NRPD and NRPE, respectively, for Nuclear RNA Polymerase D and E) arose from the duplication of Pol II (NRPB) subunits (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al. 2010</xref>). Many subunits are shared by all three polymerases, but the largest/first subunits (NRPB1, NRPD1, and NRPE1) are unique to each polymerase (<xref rid="msv060-B51" ref-type="bibr">Ream et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B17" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al. 2014</xref>). Additionally, Pol IV and V share second, fourth, fifth, and seventh subunits that are distinct from the Pol II versions, and there is evidence for continued duplication of subunits in specific lineages (<xref rid="msv060-B54" ref-type="bibr">Sidorenko et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B57" ref-type="bibr">Stonaker et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B58" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B17" ref-type="bibr">Haag et al. 2014</xref>). The earliest duplication of an NRPB subunit was detected in Characeae, an algal lineage closely related to land plants, and additional NRPB to NRPD duplications occurred after the divergence of land plants from algae (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>). However, NRPD4/E4, NRPE1, and NRPE5 have been identified only in angiosperms (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al. 2010</xref>). Additionally, phylogenomic analysis indicates that loss of NRPD2/E2 might be an important node for evolution of gymnosperms (<xref rid="msv060-B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the composition of the Pol IV and Pol V holoenzymes in nonflowering plants and uncover innovations in these enzymes associated with the evolution of endosperm, we queried genome and transcriptomes to identify NRPB, NRPD, and NRPE subunits from species representing the breadth of the land plant phylogeny (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). Using phylogenetic analysis, we describe the evolution of NRPD and NRPE subunits, and changes in the RNA Polymerase (RDR), Dicer-like (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) families across plant evolution, including all four clades of gymnosperms. We uncover the ancient origin of Pol V, as well as angiosperm-specific and seed plant-specific subunits of Pol IV and V, respectively. These findings indicate a more ancient origin of Pol V than previously described, and suggest that RdDM could be functional in the earliest land plants. Our data are also consistent with Escape from Adaptive Conflict (EAC) as the driving force behind the evolution of Pol IV and Pol V subunits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of RdDM Machinery in Nonflowering Plants</title><p>To understand the duplication and specialization of proteins in the RdDM pathway, we identified putative orthologs for each unique Pol II/IV/V subunit (the first-, second-, fourth-, fifth-, and seventh largest subunits), as well as RDR, DCL, and AGO families from taxa across the land plant lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv060-F1">fig. 1</xref>).

In fungi and metazoans, Pol II initiates small RNA biogenesis and produces scaffold transcripts that are bound by siRNA/AGO (or piRNA/PIWI) complexes. It is therefore likely that the ancestral eukaryotic Pol II performs the functions of plants&#8217; Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V, and suggests that EAC explains the retention of duplicate polymerase subunits in plants. The EAC model proposes that a protein with multiple functions experiences adaptive conflict whereby constraint from one function limits the evolutionary optimization of the second function and vice versa (<xref rid="msv060-B26" ref-type="bibr">Hughes 1994</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B22" ref-type="bibr">Hittinger and Carroll 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B36" ref-type="bibr">Marais and Rausher 2008</xref>).

This is in contrast to neofunctionalization, during which one paralog evolves a novel function by positive selection, while the other performs the ancestral function and remains under purifying selection. We performed the branch-sites test in PAML (<xref rid="msv060-B67" ref-type="bibr">Yang 2007</xref>) on each branch of a polymerase subunit family that had undergone duplication to determine whether there was evidence of positive selection postduplication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

Indeed several NRPE1 orthologs contain multiple distinct repeat units supporting the hypothesis of recurrent rounds of expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="msv060-F7">fig. 7</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Steady deterioration of these repeats due to lack of selection might account for the presence of AGO hook peptides outside of detectable repeats. Three of the NRPE1 orthologs also contain regions of simple repeats: <italic>A. thaliana</italic> NRPE1 has a QS-rich region, while <italic>Pi. canariensis</italic> NRPE1 and <italic>E. trifurca</italic> NRPE1a have GR-rich repeats. No function has been ascribed to these simple repeats, suggesting that they might be bystanders of the illegitimate recombination that likely drives duplication within the WG/GW platform (<xref rid="msv060-B28" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al. 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analysis demonstrates that RNA Pol V is an ancient polymerase present in all land plants and not restricted to angiosperms as has been suggested previously (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B60" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B38" ref-type="bibr">Matzke and Mosher 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the core RdDM machinery necessary to produce and utilize p4-siRNAs is also present in the earliest diverging plant lineages. It was reported that the loss of NRPD2 might account for the large, unmethylated genomes commonly found in gymnosperms (<xref rid="msv060-B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2011</xref>). However, our analysis suggests that NRPD2 is present in all gymnosperms and recent publications indicate that p4-siRNAs are produced in conifers (<xref rid="msv060-B62" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B46" ref-type="bibr">Nystedt et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>), hinting at a functional gymnosperm Pol IV.</p><p>Although Pol IV and V subunits are present in the earliest land plant lineages, analysis of smaller subunits within these holoenzymes and careful phylogenetic assessment of the RDR family suggests that innovations in RdDM proteins occurred later and are associated with the evolution of seeds and flowers. The duplications creating NRPD and NRPE first, second, and seventh subunits occurred prior to the evolution of extant land plant lineages, suggesting that all plants have distinct Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V holoenzymes. In nonflowering seed plants (gymnosperms), Pol V gains a specific fifth subunit and the function of Pol IV is potentially altered by the evolution of a dedicated RDR2. Finally, in flowering plants, both Pol IV and V develop a specialized fourth subunit. Further research is needed to confirm the assembly of these ancient polymerases and to assess the functional consequences of these recent duplications. It will be particularly interesting to determine if biochemical changes in Pol IV or Pol V account for the high level of p4-siRNAs observed in angiosperms.</p><p>It is striking that six of the nine genes assessed here are present in the earliest diverging land plant lineages, opening the possibility that they may have duplicated simultaneously and that their respective retentions are interdependent. A partial NRPD1 sequence was identified within four species of algae in the family Characeae, a close ancestor of land plants (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>). NRPE1 and NRPD2/E2 were not identified in these species; however, the degenerate PCR used to search for them also failed to identify NRPE1 in all nonflowering plants tested (<xref rid="msv060-B35" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Hall 2007</xref>). To determine whether other Pol IV and Pol V subunits are present in Characeae or the wider grouping of <italic>Streptophyta</italic>, we searched the six largest assembled transcriptomes present in the 1KP project from this group of algae. We were unable to identify NRPE1-specific reads, but were also unable to assemble NRPB1, suggesting that the read depth of these transcriptomes is not sufficient for our purpose. We also searched the genome of the charophyte <italic>Klebsormidium flaccidum</italic> (<xref rid="msv060-B23" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al. 2014</xref>), but were unable to detect orthologs of NRPD1, NRPE1, NRPD2/E2, or NRPD7/E7. Further work is needed to determine to what extent the RdDM pathway exists in specific algal lineages and to assess the timing of the earliest NRPB to NRPD/E duplications. Beyond increasing our understanding of RdDM, determining the extent to which components of the different polymerases duplicated simultaneously versus sequentially will broaden our knowledge about the evolution of multi-subunit complexes.</p><p>EAC is the best model to account for subfunctionalization of gene transcription and silencing activities of ancestral Pol II subunits because there is evidence that Pol II functions during transcriptional silencing in diverse eukaryotes (<xref rid="msv060-B40" ref-type="bibr">Moazed 2009</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B7" ref-type="bibr">Cecere and Grishok 2014</xref>). However, it is possible that transcriptional silencing evolved independently in plants through neofunctionalization of NRPD/E subunits following duplication. Although our data are agnostic as to whether transcriptional silencing evolved once or independently in multiple lineages, they do not support a model of neofunctionalization after duplication because there is positive selection on all NRPB branches following duplication. The lack of positive selection on most NRPD/E branches might suggest that selection for Pol II function is stronger than Pol IV or Pol V function or that our phylogenetic trees are not sufficiently dense surrounding the duplication events to detect selection on NRPD/E branches. Alternatively, the EAC model might not accurately describe evolution of multi-subunit complexes (<xref rid="msv060-B5" ref-type="bibr">Beilstein et al. 2015</xref>) and additional theoretical work (<xref rid="msv060-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sikosek et al. 2012</xref>) will be needed to model these complex interactions. Indeed, it is possible that incorporation into multiple complexes with distinct functions drives the adaptive conflict of smaller subunits.</p><p>One of the most striking findings in this study is the divergence among CTDs of NRPE1. Each NRPE1 ortholog contains a WG/GW platform in the CTD and nearly all these platforms contain embedded tandem direct repeats. However, there is no sequence identity between the WG/GW platforms, suggesting that these repeats undergo rounds of sequence deterioration and expansion through illegitimate recombination (<xref rid="msv060-B28" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="msv060-B52" ref-type="bibr">Schaper et al. 2014</xref>). Indeed, the presence of highly similar repeats within a platform, such as <italic>O. sativa</italic> NRPE1, suggests that WG/GW platform expansion is ongoing. The rapid divergence in repeat sequence is in contrast to the large majority of human tandem repeat proteins, which show deep conservation of repeat sequence and structure (<xref rid="msv060-B52" ref-type="bibr">Schaper et al. 2014</xref>). It is unclear why tandem repeats would persist in the NRPE1 CTD over such evolutionary distance, particularly in the absence of sequence homology, but this observation suggests important functions for both the repeat structure and the rapid divergence of repeat sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ortholog Identification</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> protein sequences were used as queries for TBLASTN or BLASTP searches against the <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>Am. trichopoda</italic>, <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>, and <italic>Ph. patens</italic> whole genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbev.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/msv060/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).
