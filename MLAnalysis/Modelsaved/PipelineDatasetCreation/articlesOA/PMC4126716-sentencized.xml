</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis), which is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia and Southwest China [1], possesses many unique characteristics that contribute to its suitability as an experimental animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our previous phylogenomic analyses revealed that this animal is closely related to primates, with both shared and unique features useful for characterizing nervous and immune system signaling pathways[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Until now, Many attempts have been made to use the tree shrew as an animal model for hepatitis C virus infection [3], hepatitis B virus infection [4], [5], myopia [6], social stress and depression [7] and bacterial infection [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite recent progress, various obstacles continue to hinder the establishment of the tree shrew as an animal model, including a lack of detailed knowledge, such as its genetic background, drug targets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, because of the high quality of the tree shrew genome and the need for better animal models for in vivo pharmacological testing, we nevertheless believe that the tree shrew is a promising model for drug target discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Drug targets and their products is the core elements required to develop better animal models for drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The interaction of these targets with ligands can modulate the function of many classes of pharmaceutically useful proteins, including enzymes, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channel proteins and nuclear receptors [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Many computational approaches have been developed to analyze and predict drug targets based on compound-protein interactions [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, these studies primarily focused on searches for new drugs or targets, and approaches appropriate for high-throughput genomic or transcriptomic screening of drug targets have not been developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this present study, we addressed the important problem of drug target identification in drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Then, we developed a useful pipeline and stringent search strategy for large-scale genomic and transcriptomic screening of candidate proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition, we optimized this strategy for drug target identification. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We developed a pipeline for the global annotation of transcripts from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Because we focused on drug target proteins or domains, our information retrieval system was biased toward predicted protein-coding transcripts (such as homologs of known genes or those with coding potential). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome assembly was performed using both ab initio and de novo methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Using the ab initio assembly programs Tophat and Cufflinks, 173,454 transcripts were obtained from seven different tree shrew tissues (brain, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, ovary and testis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome de novo assembly was performed using the SOAPdenovo-trans program to identify 121,817 transcripts (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To maximize the detection of protein-coding transcripts, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition that considers a sequence to be protein-coding if it contains the complete coding DNA sequence (CDS) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>As a result, 53.2% of the 173,454 transcripts assembled ab initio from 107,429 loci included regions annotated as CDSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A total of 50.6% of the 121,817 transcripts assembled de novo were annotated as CDSs and aligned with 100% identity to the transcripts assembled by Cufflinks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the transcriptomes generated by the two assembly methods (Figure 1B) revealed that 106,773 transcripts could be assembled using either method, although thousands of novel transcripts were identified separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Consequently, subsequent analyses were based on protein-coding transcripts obtained via ab initio assembly. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Over the last several years, it has become increasingly clear that there are significant differences between rodents, dogs, monkeys and humans with respect to the absorption, distribution and excretion of many drugs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The choice of a suitable animal model for drug testing is thus critical for drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Because of its genetic characteristics, the tree shrew is a promising biomedical model and ideal for drug testing and drug target analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Previous drug target and network analyses have frequently focused on four common drug target families: enzymes, GPCRs, ion channel proteins and nuclear receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In addition, immune pathway components are increasingly popular key drug targets for disease therapy [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>It is well established that high-throughput genome screening can identify potent drug targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our large-scale approach, as described in the Results section, was based on the screening of genomic and transcriptomic data of seven candidate drug target families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Based on the ranking of total scores used in our drug target identification approach, more than 90% of the candidate proteins were finally identified as potential drug targets in the tree shrew. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Combined with genomic and transcriptomic data, the expression of each drug target is an important criterion during drug evaluation and pharmacological testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, expression profiling of drug targets has been used to compare characteristic cell responses to genetic and chemical perturbations and analyze associations between genes and drugs [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The results of our drug target expression analysis reconfirmed the correlation between expression patterns and the results of pharmacological testing and evaluation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Our drug target analysis identified additional drug targets in the tree shrew that may warrant further drug testing and functional research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The highest-ranked targets were mainly related to cancer, mental disorders and metabolic diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Notably, the association with mental disorders may be relevant to the considerable progress that has been achieved in studies of social stress and depression using the tree shrew as a model [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In addition, the most impressive drug targets, which were related to various cancers, had the highest scores and most significant expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Finally, comparison with mouse and human orthologs revealed that more than half of tree shrew drug targets were more comparable to human target proteins than were those in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>And, most of human drug target proteins are present in the Chinese tree shrew genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>These results encourage us to continue our development of the tree shrew for drug discovery as a potential drug testing model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>To test the applicability of our approach, predicted drug targets of PARs, i.e., subsets of GPCRs, were experimentally validated in the tree shrew. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>PARs have become attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics for several diseases [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In the treatment of cardiovascular diseases using antiplatelet therapies, PARs are also important targets that bind inhibitors of thrombin-induced platelet activation [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Based on our previous studies of PARs and their mediation of platelet aggregation [20], tree shrew PARs were promising targets for platelet aggregation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Importantly, PAR distributions in tree shrew platelets are similar to those of humans but differ from those of mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In addition, the N-terminal tethered ligand of human PAR-APs can induce the aggregation of tree shrew platelets; in contrast, this tethered ligand does not induce the activation of any mouse PARs except for PAR4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, synthesized tree shrew PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP was used to further study the PARs expression on Chinese tree shrews' platelet, at last we found that there was a greater activation than platelets stimulated with human PAR1-AP or PAR4-AP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, vorapaxar—an irreversible antagonist of human PAR1, was used in the anti thrombin-induced platelet aggregation assays, our findings shown that vorapaxar had a inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced human or tree shrew platelet aggregation, but human platelets was more sensitive to vorapaxar compared to tree shrew platelets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This result is likely from the difference in PAR1 key site between human and tree shrew, or other unclear factors, such as platelet osmotic pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These results collectively validate our prediction that the tree shrew is likely used as a potential research model for drug testing for cardiovascular and other related diseases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our approach may be successfully used to predict target proteins for drug testing in animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In contrast to network discovery strategies [11], [21], [22], the majority of candidate proteins in our study were predicted as drug targets with a high similarity to human orthologs for further pharmacological testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>If a protein is a new drug target, however, insufficient information exists for further prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our approach is an efficient strategy for large-scale screening of drug targets using genomic or transcriptomic data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of our strategy for large-scale drug target prediction and the evaluation of model-based target identification for drug testing. </plain></SENT>
