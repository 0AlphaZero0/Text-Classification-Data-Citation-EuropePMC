Tens of thousands of gene expression profiling experiments are stored in public repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B2">Barrett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B26">Parkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and are increasingly studied in aggregate. The aim of these studies is typically to discover a set of genes that participate in a pathway and are robustly predictive of a biological phenotype in a meta-analysis of multiple studies.</p><p>Gene set analysis (GSA) was developed to identify such gene sets whose expression distinguishes biological conditions, even if single-gene analysis fails to find significant associations with the phenotype. The method takes advantage of <italic>a priori</italic> defined gene sets published in gene set databases (Gene Ontology, KEGG and MSigDB) or resulting from differential expression studies (MSigDB and GeneSigDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B8 bts438-B7">Culhane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B36">Subramanian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). GSA has been successfully applied to the analysis of microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B10">Goeman and Buehlmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B23">Mootha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and has been extended beyond transcriptomics to other areas, such as analysis of genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B4">Cantor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B40">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). When compared to traditional single-gene analysis that ranks differential gene expression between two conditions, GSA produced more consistent biological results across studies even when some genes in a gene set were absent or poorly represented in a dataset (Fan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011). Although GSA naturally extends to integrated meta-analysis, surprisingly few studies have applied meta-GSA to integration of multiple datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B31">Segal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B22">Montaner and Dopazo, 2010</xref>). Most meta-GSA approaches are designed for the limited case, where datasets have matched samples or features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B22">Montaner and Dopazo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B38">Tyekucheva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These either create a merged dataset of features (genes) common to all datasets and perform a GSA or apply GSA on each individual datasets and then combine the resulting GSA statistics or <italic>P</italic>-values to produce a ranked list of gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B22">Montaner and Dopazo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B33">Shen and Tseng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B38">Tyekucheva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While a single ranked list of gene sets may capture the biological complexity of a simple cellular system, it is insufficient when applied to the study of complex disease or meta-analysis of large numbers of studies where different pathways are active in different subsets of samples. These limitations can be addressed using bi-clustering, a simultaneous similarity-based clustering of features and conditions, resulting in modules; subsets of features that exhibit consistent patterns over subsets of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B6">Cheng and Church, 2000</xref>). Numerous bi-clustering approaches have been applied to continuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B6">Cheng and Church, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B12">Hochreiter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B13">Huttenhower <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and discretized gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B27">Prelic, 2005</xref>); however, these methods have not been applied in meta-GSA.</p><p>We introduce <bold>i</bold>terative <bold>B</bold>inary <bold>Bi</bold>-clustering of <bold>G</bold>ene sets (iBBiG), a new bi-clustering algorithm to perform meta-GSA that addresses the shortcomings of &#8216;ranked list&#8217; meta-GSA approaches. It scales well when applied to hundreds of datasets is tolerant to noise characteristic of genomics data and when applied on simulated data, outperforms clustering and bi-clustering methods including hierarchical and <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, FABIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B12">Hochreiter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), COALESCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B13">Huttenhower <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and Bimax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B27">Prelic, 2005</xref>). To perform meta-GSA, we first transform &#8216;noisy&#8217; gene expression profiles to simple binary gene set profiles, which simplifies the conjoint study of different studies as it negates the need to match probes across platforms. We then apply iBBiG to extract clusters or &#8216;modules&#8217; of groups of phenotypes whose gene expression profiles are enriched in similar gene sets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bts438/DC1">Supplementary</ext-link>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bts438-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). An attractive feature of iBBiG is that it does not require prior knowledge or limit the number or size of clusters, a non-trivial requirement in cluster analysis of most large biological datasets. The results of iBBiG are easy to parse; iBBiG modules are ranked by an information score, and within each module, gene sets are ranked by a fitness score that measures its weight in the module. It uses a genetic algorithm to maximize the size and entropy of each bi-cluster producing a small number of bi-clusters whose functional and phenotypic associations can be easily interpreted; eight modules were associated with known breast cancer clinical covariates in meta-GSA of 21 breast cancer gene expression datasets, and we detected 13 modules prognostic both within and across breast cancer molecular subtypes using a cluster discovery approach, which ignored <italic>a priori</italic> sample knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2"><title>2 MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We tested the ability of iBBiG to discover bi-clusters in matrices of real and simulated data. Real gene expression data were transformed to gene set profiles using two different GSA approaches (i) single sample and (ii) pairwise test which were computed using the Bioconductor packages gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and GSEAlm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B25">Oron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), respectively. GSVA ranks gene sets within each individual gene expression profile to produce a gene set by sample matrix. GSEAlm tests for enrichment of gene sets in a ranked list of genes that are differential expressed between two conditions or clinical covariates (e.g. Grade 1 versus Grade 3) resulting in a gene set by pairwise test matrix. Resulting GSA <italic>P</italic>-values are discretized generating a spare binary matrix. Columns contain &#8216;phenotypes&#8217; defined by single sample or a pairwise test GSA results, in which 1 is a significant association (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between a gene set and phenotype and 0 represents a lack of association.</p><sec id="SEC2.1"><title>2.1 Datasets</title><sec id="SEC2.1.1"><title>2.1.1 Single sample GSA data</title><p>Normalized gene expression of primary breast tumors was download from GEO (GSE20685, <italic>n</italic> = 327) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B16">Kao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) or imported from the Bioconductor data packages breastCancerNKI (<italic>n</italic> = 337) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B39">van't Veer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and breastCancerVDX (<italic>n</italic> = 344) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B21">Minn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Data were obtained on Affymetrix U133 Plus2, Agilent and Affymetrix U133a GeneChip arrays; each contained different numbers of features. GSVA was applied using gene sets from C2 subset of MSigDB v3.0 to transform gene expression data into gene set <italic>x</italic> sample matrices. No prior knowledge or covariates were used in GSVA. The resulting values were discretized (<italic>es.os</italic>&#8804;&#177;0.3) to produce an association matrix of sparse (11.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 1) binary data of 1008 columns (breast cancer samples) and 5098 rows (up and down-regulated results for 2459 gene sets). iBBiG was applied with default parameters with nModules = 20.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.1.2"><title>2.1.2 GSEAlm data</title><p>To discover modules associated with known breast cancer clinical covariates, 21 normalized breast cancer gene expression datasets (3875 gene expression profiles, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bts438/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) annotated with 107 clinical covariates were obtained from the GeneChip Ontology Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B20">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Clinical covariates included tumor grade, stage, age or hormone status. GSEAlm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B25">Oron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008)</xref> was applied to all pairwise combinations of each covariate. For example, if the covariate grade has levels 1, 2 and 3, all possible pairwise combinations would result in six phenotypes (Grades 1v2,1v3,2v1,2v3,3v1 and 3v2), therefore pairwise tests of the 107 covariates resulted in 448 phenotypes. GSEAlm was performed independently and we did not merge studies at the probe (gene), sample or phenotype level. Gene sets from the C2 and C5 subsets of MSigDB v2.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 2293) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B36">Subramanian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and GeneSigDB v1.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 560) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B8">Culhane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) were used.

Examination of the fitness score and module size plots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bts438/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 24</ext-link>) identified eight modules that had a fitness score of over 1000 and a minimum of five pairwise tests.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.1.3"><title>2.1.3 Simulated data</title><p>using observations of GSA results of real data, we simulated a dataset of 400 pairwise tests by 400 gene sets in which we placed seven modules (M1&#8211;M7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bts438-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These were introduced by assigning associations (value of 1) to column and row pairs. To replicate the expected properties of real data, modules were created such that they partially overlap in columns, in rows and in both directions; M1 gene sets overlapped with all modules except M3. M2 overlapped pairwise tests with modules M4&#8211;7. Artificial modules had highly variable sizes and included &#8216;wide&#8217; modules driven by a large number of pairwise tests with few gene sets and &#8216;tall&#8217; modules like M1 which contained 25 pairwise tests with a large number of gene sets (<italic>n</italic> = 250). This latter module (with many gene sets) might represent a complex, well-characterized biological process such as proliferation. Random background noise (at 10%), which is characteristically observed in genomics data, was also added. In real data the signal strength will vary both between and within modules. Therefore, to simulate variance among modules, random noise (replacing values of 1 with 0) was imposed to produce modules with different signal strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bts438-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Within a module, we expect to see few strong signals (gene sets associated with all pairwise tests) and many weaker signals. Therefore, within each module, a noise gradient was also applied so that the first gene sets had a greater number of associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bts438-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This within-noise gradient ranged from 10 to 60% and varied between modules. The size, signal strength and signal gradient of each module are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="bts438-T1">Table 1</xref>. Overlaps are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bts438-F1">Figure 1</xref>.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of heuristic search algorithms and a particular form of optimization methods based on evolutionary concepts. They use natural selection, recombination and sexual reproduction in order to find heuristic solutions for optimization problems. In the GA implemented in iBBiG, a module (individual) is represented by a binary vector with length equal to the number of phenotypes, where 1 indicates membership of a phenotype within a module. A population of such individuals is initialized by randomly selecting two phenotypes. The fitness of each individual is evaluated using the entropy-based gene set score. High-fitness individuals are chosen as parents to create the next generation of solutions, using a linear ranking selection operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B5">Chakraborty and Chakraborty, 1997</xref>). A single-point crossover operator is used for recombination and a bit flip operator for the mutation operator. An offspring selection operator is used to introduce self adaptive selection pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B1">Affenzeller and Wagner, 2005</xref>). The algorithm produces generations of solutions, until the highest fitness score in the population stagnates for a specified number of generations.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.2.3"><title>2.2.3 Iterative module extraction</title><p>The bi-clustering approach described so far is able to find one module at a time.

Data integration is made tractable by transformation of continuous &#8216;noisy&#8217; gene expression data (with different probes/genes in each study) into profiles of differentially enriched gene sets (which are common to all studies). We examined two GSA approaches, GSEAlm which tests for enrichment of gene sets in genes that are differentially regulated between conditions and GSVA which is single sample GSA. The former can be applied to identifying gene sets or pathways associated with known clinical covariates, the latter is a pure discovery approach that ignores prior sample knowledge.</p><p>We designed iBBiG to have high specificity and thereby minimize the false-positive rate when discovering new classes, but the iterative approach employed in iBBiG ensures it is sufficiently sensitive to discover weak signals, even if they are potentially masked by stronger ones. When applied to simulated data it outperforms widely used global clustering approaches (<italic>K</italic>-means, hierarchical cluster analysis) and newer bi-clustering approaches (Bimax, FABIA and COALESCE) and is able to find overlapping gene set modules of varying sizes. iBBiG was able to identify all clusters in a simulated meta-GSA dataset with high levels of specificity and sensitivity. An advantage of iBBiG relative to other methods is that it does not require <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the true number of clusters. Following the application of iBBiG, the number of true clusters can be estimated from the weighed scores of the extracted modules. In some cases, we observed that a module may represent the residue or remaining signal of a stronger, previously extracted module. This residue remains because iBBiG only removes information from the data matrix that is actually used for the entropy-based score in a module. However, we do not consider these residual modules to be a shortcoming of the method as their existence facilitates discovery of the true overlap between modules and, further, these modules can be easily detected by looking at the overlap of phenotypes and gene sets.</p><p>Although iBBiG includes several parameters, we have shown that most impact only computation time and do not effect cluster discovery. The only parameter that had an impact on cluster discovery was &#945;, which regulates the weighting between cluster homogeneity and the number of phenotypes. This parameter is useful in fine-adjustment of the sensitivity&#8211;specificity ratio.</p><p>One major advantage of iBBiG is its robustness in the presence of noise and its tolerance of missing data. It can tolerate high levels of noise as the entropy derived fitness score add members to a bi-cluster once the number of associations exceeds 50%. We demonstrate that iBBiG performs well even in the presence of false-positive associations and noise in both signal (20%) and background (40%). Second, iBBiG does not require a gene set to be associated with all phenotypes in a bi-cluster which is a attractive feature in complex biological data were biological processes maybe redundant or regulated by multiple factors concurrently. Many other bi-clustering algorithms, including Bimax and the recently described BiBiT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B29">Rodriguez-Baena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), discover only homogenous bi-clusters and have low tolerance to noise and missing data. Bimax identified a large number of mini-bi-clusters and was unable to identify large clusters in our simulated dataset. In practice, application of Bimax to genomics data requires post-processing of bi-cluster results in order to either join or visualize overlapping bi-clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B30">Santamaria <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We applied iBBiG to discovery of new modules among 1008 primary breast tumors and discovered 13 modules in an iBBiG-GSVA analysis. Each module contained samples from multiple studies demonstrating successful data integration. While the largest highest confidence modules (M1&#8211;M4) discovered breast cancer molecular subtypes known to be important in breast cancer, the smaller modules represented sub-sets of these subtypes, supporting recent evidence that there are subtypes within each of the principal breast cancer molecular subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B9">Curtis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The module M10 was characterized by gene sets associated with angiogenesis in response to hypoxia (or HIF1A degregulation) and was a strong predictor of recurrence in Luminal and ERRB2 amplied breast cancer. We uncovered different modules (<italic>n</italic> = 8) associated with pairwise tests of breast cancer clinical covariates in a meta-GSA of 21 breast cancer gene expression datasets. Five of the eight modules including the first and largest module was strongly associated with tumor grade. Most high grade tumors were characterized by increased cell cycle (B1/B8) and those with fewer metastases had significant regulation of immune response genes (B4). In a meta-analysis of two datasets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B34">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, (2010)</xref> also reported an up-regulation of proliferation genes and down-regulation of cell adhesion genes in high-grade breast tumors. Although they had insufficient numbers of patients to establish statistical significance, they observed that high levels of immune genes were an indicator of good prognosis in high-grade breast cancer patients. Our analysis also suggests B4 immune response is associated with better outcome. When we examined which genes that most frequently appeared in module B4 GeneSigDB gene signatures, we found several chemokines including CCL5 (RANTES), a key regulators of T-cell immune response highly expressed in breast cancer and reported to be associated with metastases and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B35">Soria and Ben-Baruch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B41">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009)</xref>. However, our analysis does not fit this prevailing hypothesis and suggests CCL5 is associated with good prognosis in high-grade breast cancer patients.</p><p>In this study, we have used iBBiG to discover clusters in matrices of discretized <italic>P</italic>-values from GSA of gene expression data; however, the method can also be easily applied to GSA of other different data types including SNP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B4">Cantor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B28">Raychaudhuri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). iBBiG can be applied to non-geneset data. For example, to demonstrate the application of iBBiG to an extremely sparse matrix (&lt;0.3% &gt; 0) in which small clusters are expected, iBBiG was applied to discretized data from the NHGRI genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B11">Hindorff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). As the weighted scores were low for modules identified, we averaged results over 100 runs of iBBiG and chose 10 robust modules. Only genes and traits that occured in at least 65/100 runs were included (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bts438/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S27</ext-link>). These modules are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bts438/DC1">Supplementary Table S22</ext-link>. It discovered a possible link between triglyercides, HDL cholesterol and waist circumference with genes GCKR, LPL, BUD13 and ZNF259. Although LPL, BUD13 and ZNF259 has been implicated previously, this module suggested a new link with an expanding waistline and GCKR. While GSA requires input gene sets, it is not restricted to databases of curated gene sets and can use gene sets deduced through text mining from the published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B14">Jelier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B18">Krallinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B28">Raychaudhuri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We anticipate iBBiG will be useful in integrated data analysis of multiple data types. iBBiG can be performed on any binary matrix and could be applied to binary protein&#8211;protein interaction or RNAi data; we would like to extend it to other data types, including categorical data. An attractive feature of iBBiG compared to others methods such as the recently described logistic regression meta-GSA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bts438-B22">Montaner and Dopazo, 2010</xref>) is its ability to perform integrative analysis using dozens of datasets.</p><p>In summary, iBBiG provides a simple, robust, rapid and scalable method for meta-GSA. When applied to simulated data it outperforms commonly used clustering and bi-clustering approaches and iteratively discovers gene set modules made up of both strong and weaker signals. Meta-GSA using iBBiG constitutes a new approach for discovery of pathway and gene set behavior across multiple studies and provides a higher-level understanding of gene and cellular function.
