The mechanisms controlling these expression programs have yet to be identified. Exploring transcriptional enhancers throughout hematopoietic cell development and derived cancers, we uncovered a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations. These epimutations are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers, designated ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs) of the hematopoietic cell lineage. We found that hematopoietic ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, indicative of their chromatin activity states. Strikingly, ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylated ESSEs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive or hematopoietic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESSEs in cancer. Further analyses of a hypomethylated ESSE downstream to the VEGFA gene revealed a novel regulatory circuit affecting VEGFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. We suggest that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We demonstrate that a particular subtype of transcriptional enhancers, which we termed ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), are especially prone to DNA methylation perturbations in cancer. Moreover, the methylation status of ESSEs, but not that of the enhancers of tissue stem cells, is associated with gene activity in cancer cell lines and in fresh tumor samples. Extending the previous reports on the hypermethylation of particular gene promoters in cancer, our analyses revealed both hyper- and hypo-methylation of regulatory elements in cancer, in association with silencing and enhancing, respectively, of important cancer genes. Thus, the discovered sites are appealing candidates for epigenetic control of cancer expression profiles.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and The Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 41/11 to AH; and grant No. 1796/12 and 2013/14 to YB), grants from the Israel Science Foundation (to YB 734/13 and AH 1162/12), a Rosetrees Trust grant to AH, a research grant from the Israel Cancer Research Foundation (ICRF to YB) and a grant from the Binational Science Foundation (BSF to YB) The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Disruption of normal cellular identity is a hallmark of cancer cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Various cancer types display gene expression profiles that show similarities to the expression program of embryonic stem cells (ES), but are absent from the differentiated tissue from which the cancer evolves. These ES and cancer-specific expression signatures comprise genes of the ES core module, including NANOG, OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) module including EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, the MYC module and other genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Many of these genes participate in inter- and intra-cellular signaling pathways. ES-like gene expression profiles may result from re-wiring of stem cell regulatory circuits in cancer. In line with this theory, DNase I hypersensitive sites profiling revealed extensive reprograming of ES-specific regulatory elements in cancer [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, ES-like chromatin patterns mediated by the PRC2, which predispose genes to DNA hypermethylation and permanent silencing in cancer, have been reported in loci proximal to transcription start sites (TSSs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the establishment of ES-related expression profiles in cancer are not well understood.</p><p>Transcriptional enhancers control the expression of genes independently of their orientation, position or distance relative to TSS [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their genomic locations, covering more than 10% of the human genome, are readily detected on the basis of characteristic chromatin marks, primarily the monomethylation of histone 3 lysine-4 (H3K4me1) [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many enhancers are specific to certain tissues or cell types, including a particularly large group of enhancers that are exclusive to embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to gene promoters, which tend to maintain their core chromatin structure across expressing and non-expressing cells, with some minor activity-related modifications, enhancer chromatin is not constant across cell types. Rather, enhancer sites may display active, inactive, or entirely na&#239;ve non-regulatory chromatin states across cells. The generation of the enhancer chromatin landscape is a complex multilayered process that involves the recruitment of chromatin modulators and pioneer transcription factors to certain genomic sites upon specification of particular cell lineages. Once established, enhancers can be found in active or inactive states, characterized by H3K27ac and H3K27me3, respectively, and by other chromatin features. However, in other cell lineages the very same sites do not display regulatory chromatin structures, and are unable to support transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, epigenetic reprograming of enhancer elements was previously shown to be prevalent in multiple cancer types, and evidence showing their role in cancer development has been reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the rules that govern the activation or silencing of these regulatory elements in cancer are still an enigma. Here we hypothesize that across the cancer genome, sites that once had developed an enhancer chromatin state throughout the history of the cancer cells would be more prone to be activated and to stimulate gene transcription in cancer than sites that had never been enhancers. Thus, the repertoire of enhancers established during the developmental history of cancer cells may define their expression potential.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that the DNA methylation level is closely linked to enhancer activity states [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and to expression levels of associated cancer genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We now utilized DNA methylation data to investigate the fate of ES enhancers during normal hematopoietic development and in cancer. Surprisingly, we discovered that enhancers present in ES cells and absent from differentiated hematopoietic cells are especially prone to DNA methylation alterations in cancer. Moreover, these changes in methylation are in accordance with the expression levels of adjacent genes, and thus may provide a basis for the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>DNA methylation characterizes enhancer dynamics during development of the hematopoietic cell lineage</title><p>We explored the fate of ES enhancers during normal development of the hematopoietic cell lineage.

A total 179,910 non-promoter, non-CpG island methylation sites were located and the prevalence of the H3K4me1 chromatin mark typical of enhancers around these sites was analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1A Fig</xref>). Also, 229,306 promoter methylation sites were located and H3K4me3, a mark typical of gene promoters around these sites was analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s006">S2A Fig</xref>). Many sites showed a loss of H3K4me1 marks in HSC versus ES: out of 79,725 H3K4me1 sites, 49,031 (61.5%) lost the mark in HSC, whereas 20,380 (25.6%) maintained it in ES and only 10,314 (12.9%) gained it in the HSC. The tendency to lose H3K4me1 between ES to HSC was strictly associated with enhancers, as only 13.7% of the promoters with the H3K4me3 mark in ES showed a loss of the mark in the HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Moreover, this massive loss of enhancer mark was particularly notable between ESs and HSCs, because in differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD19<sup>+</sup> B-cells, only 27.4%, 25.7%, and 37.8% of the HSC H3K4me1-marked sites, respectively, were lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s005">S1 Fig</xref>).

Through a set of experiments in living leukemic cells we explored whether this ESSE regulates VEGFA expression. This site was chosen as the role of VEGFA in various cancer types, including leukemia, is well documented [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the mechanism underlying VEGFA activation in cancers is unknown. Furthermore, VEGFA is a main component in the enriched network of genes located in proximity to hypomethylated ESSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). VEGFA was strongly expressed in ES cells, significantly downregulated in B and T lymphocytes, and reactivated to the ES level in T cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In accordance, the methylation of the linked ESSE site was negatively correlated with VEGFA expression in ES, normal T and B cells, T cell leukemia (Jurkat) and erythroleukemia (K562) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To determine whether this ESSE is able to enhance transcription, a 1,500 bp fragment surrounding the ESSE methylation site was cloned upstream to a minimal SV40 promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid and transfected to K562 cells.

The Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C-seqencing) assay allowed mapping the interactions between the VEGFA promoter and DNA sequences across the K562 cell genome. Across the entire genome only three genomic regions interacted with the VEGFA promoter: a large region surrounding the VEGFA gene (expected from this type of analysis); a region harboring the ESSE site located about 160 kb downstream from the promoter; and a region about 300 kb downstream from the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the ESSE-containing region also contains single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs9472155; rs11755845; rs4513773) previously associated with the circulating VEGFA level, whereas the more downstream region binds HIF1-alpha, a key regulator of VEGFA expression in human cells (hg19-chr6:44,040,242&#8211;44,045,241; HepG2 GSE16347; HUVEC GSE39089). Of note, in addition to the above described HIF1-alpha site, there is only one more HIF1-alpha binding site, located 5&#8217; to the VEGF promoter, in the 10 Mb surrounding the VEGFA gene. Thus, we will refer to the region located 300 kb downstream from the VEGFA gene and harboring the HIF1-alpha binding site as the HIF1-alpha region. As shown, the association between the VEGFA promoter and the HIF1-alpha binding region appeared constitutive in both normal B and leukemic cells, whereas the interactions of both regions with the ESSE-containing region were significantly stronger (<italic>p-value</italic> = 1.1E-14) in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Thus, the VEGFA promoter and the HIF1-alpha binding region physically interact in both expressing and non-expressing cells, but the interaction of the two with the ESSE region, containing the genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) polymorphisms, is significantly more notable in VEGFA-expressing cells and when the ESSE is less methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether VEGFA expression depends upon the ESSE, we mutated the ESSE site in K562 cells by utilization of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system.

This has led to the assumptions that tumors originate in undifferentiated cells embedded in the tissue, from dedifferentiation of tissue cells induced by carcinogenetic signals, or from activation of particular stem cell genes through stochastic regulatory mutations later selected by the developing cancer. Our results support an alternative scenario, in which upon loss of control over the global methylome typical of many cancer types, sites that already carry particular regulatory chromatin structures are prone to specific silencing or reactivating methylation modifications. In turn, these modifications may alter gene expression. Among gene regulatory sites, enhancers are particularly versatile owing to their tissue-specific chromatin structures. Indeed, several studies have shown that reprogramming of enhancer activity during cellular transformation such as acquisition of a drug resistance phenotype and other cancer-specific characteristics [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] plays an essential role in cancer development and progression [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The mechanism underlying this association is unclear, and may involve active adaptation of the DNA methylation level upon enhancer specifications, the effect of methylation on transcription factor binding, and possible feedbacks from the gene transcription machinery. In addition, genes are frequently controlled by sets of enhancers, which may be affected by various activity factors. Therefore, unmethylated enhancers do not necessarily dictate gene activity and methylated enhancers do not automatically eliminate gene expression. In line with these notions, our findings show that enhancer hypomethylation is not a simple outcome of the gene expression status or an absolute requirement for gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Rather, we suggest that ES-specific enhancers provide a framework for gene activity profiles upon global methylation perturbation in cancer.</p><p>Indeed, our genomic analyses of open resource data revealed a highly significant association between the methylation state of the predicted ESSE sites and the activity state of the corresponding genes in ES and cancers. To reveal whether these analyses identify actual regulatory sites that affect the expression potential of ES genes in cancer, we further performed a set of validating experiments. As a model gene we chose VEGFA, an important cancer gene that is expressed in many types of cancer, including lymphomas, and in ES cells, but not in differentiated white blood cells. Beyond the significant co-localization of ESSEs with the VEGF-A signaling pathway genes, including VEGFA itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4A&#8211;4D</xref>), and the tendency of these genes to be upregulated in the cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), we also characterized a particular site predicted to be a novel VEGFA enhancer. We show that the predicted site displays the full list of essential enhancer characteristics, such as the ability to drive expression from a minimal promoter in the relevant cell type when placed upstream or downstream to the gene, and the physical interaction with the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Moreover, the predicted site does not only interact, but plays a causative role in controlling VEGFA activity in the cancer, as shown by the genome-editing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Finally, we provide experimental evidence that the DNA methylation state of this ESSE site strongly affects its activity level as a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Cumulatively, these experiments strongly support our suggestion that the predicted sites, initially recognized through genomic correlation analyses, are <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulators that support the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.</p><p>Because ES enhancers are present at the origin of all cell types, they are expected to affect gene expression in various types of cancer. Our pan-cancer analyses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g009">9</xref>) support this assumption. Interestingly, HSC enhancers were not prone to hypomethylation in hematopoietic cancers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005840.g002">2B, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005840.s008">S4</xref>). This may indicate that enhancers of a given cell lineage are relatively immune to the global hypomethylation of cancer cells. This could be due to lineage-specific chromatin structures, which help to maintain an appropriate chromatin activity state in the face of the disturbed epigenome of cancer cells. ESSEs may lack these additional structures found in differentiated cells, and are thus more prone to the global methylation perturbations typical of cancer cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal a novel pattern of regulatory epigenetic mutations in cancer. The new pattern is significantly more effective in ESSEs than in non ES-specific enhancers and promoters. Whereas the most reported pattern in gene promoters is hypermethylation of already-repressed genes, namely polycomb-repressed genes (with the exception of differentially methylated valleys (DMVs) in CRC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005840.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the new pattern involves both hyper- and hypomethylations. This new pattern could participate in silencing particular ES genes in cancer, as well as lead to reactivation of ES genes that are silenced in normal somatic cells. The new pattern appears in both cancer cell lines and fresh tumor samples, and may predict the expression levels of important oncogenes across cancers and patients, as demonstrated for the VEGFA gene. The ability to detect this program with the limited genomic coverage provided by the available methylation methods highlights the potential for the discovery of additional key regulatory circuits in normal and cancer cells, once appropriate enhancer mapping methods have been developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Datasets</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Histone modifications</title><p>The ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the National Institute of Health (NIH) Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/</ext-link>) in WIG format aligned to build GRCh36/hg18.
