However, no reports of SCZ cases with loss of function variants in the <italic>ADK</italic> region have been published. This study firstly describes the relationship between the loss of function variant of ADK and the phenotypes of SCZ.

Recently, rare variants such as copy number variants (CNVs) (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Malhotra and Sebat, 2012</xref>) and single nucleotide variants (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) have been a focus of research because of their large effect size on increased susceptibility to SCZ and because of the possibility of elucidating the pathophysiology of this mental disorder and identifying new drug targets through functional analysis of the discovered rare variants (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Legge et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The genotype first approach (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Stessman et al., 2014</xref>) is a gene-centric methodology for complex disorders such as SCZ and has been applied for subtyping this mental disorder and understanding the etiopathophysiology of SCZ. For example, loss of function variants in <italic>SETD1A</italic>, which encodes a subunit of histone methyltransferase and is related to the histone H3K4 methylation pathway, are associated with SCZ and are mutated in 0.13% of SCZ cases; carriers of these variants have common phenotypic features (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Takata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, carriers of the disruptive variant of chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 8 (<italic>CHD8</italic>) show phenotypes such as autistic features, intellectual disability, insomnia, and gastrointestinal problems (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bernier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, discovering variants associated with characteristic phenotypes and investigating the functional mechanism is a promising method for subtyping and elucidating the etiopathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of adenosine kinase (<italic>ADK</italic>) in the etiopathophysiology of SCZ. ADK converts adenosine to adenosine monophosphate and is closely related to several physical phenotypes, such as liver dysfunction and dysmorphic features (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Staufner et al., 2016</xref>), and neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and sleep disorder (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Boison and Aronica, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ADK</italic> is a highly ranked haploinsufficient gene in the DECIFER database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/browser">https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/browser</ext-link>) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Firth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). In this database, 5 of 10 registered CNVs in the <italic>ADK</italic> region are de novo variants, and patients with a CNV in the <italic>ADK</italic> region have phenotypes related to neurodevelopment such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.</p><p>Adenosine modulates neurotransmission through activation of adenosine receptors at synaptic sites and is related to the pathophysiology of SCZ by regulating the release of both dopamine and glutamate (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Boison et al., 2012</xref>). Extracellular levels of endogenous adenosine in the brain mainly depend on the astrocyte-based adenosine cycle, which involves ADK (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Boison et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). ADK deficiency in the brain may result in dysregulation of synaptic plasticity (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Sandau et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>ADK</italic> transgenic mice show impaired attention, which is closely linked to SCZ. Augmentation of adenosine by pharmacologic inhibition of ADK ameliorates cognitive function and exerts antipsychotic-like activity in mice (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, adenosine modulator adjuvant therapy is beneficial for treating the symptoms of SCZ (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Hirota and Kishi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>ADK</italic> may contribute to SCZ susceptibility, no reports of SCZ cases with loss of function variants in the <italic>ADK</italic> region have been published. In our previous CNV analysis with a large number of Japanese individuals (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Kushima et al., 2017</xref>), we discovered a deletion in the <italic>ADK</italic> region that was present in only one SCZ case and not in control samples.</p><p>Here we present a case study describing the details of this SCZ patient with <italic>ADK</italic> deletion. We identified a frame shift mutation in <italic>ADK</italic>, resulting in low <italic>ADK</italic> mRNA. Moreover, this carrier of the <italic>ADK</italic> deletion had not only the SCZ phenotype but also other neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy and Parkinsonism that were previously suggested to be caused by ADK deficiency. Therefore, we conclude that the CNV in the <italic>ADK</italic> region could result in susceptibility to the phenotypes described in this case.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>Sample and Clinical Assessments</title><p>In our previous genome-wide CNV analysis using high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Kushima et al., 2017</xref>), we identified a SCZ patient with deletion in the <italic>ADK</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) among Japanese cohort samples comprising 1699 SCZ and 824 controls (CON).

She was diagnosed with SCZ at 38 years of age based on auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and psychomotor excitation. Her mother was also diagnosed with SCZ. Her developmental milestones were normal. After she graduated from junior high school, she worked in manufacturing. She was married and had 3 children. When she was 38 years old, she suffered from persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations and was then diagnosed with SCZ, hospitalized, and started medication treatment with antipsychotics. An electroencephalogram abnormality was discovered during her first hospitalization, but she was not diagnosed with epilepsy at that time. She was hospitalized repeatedly after failing to report to the mental hospital and for discontinuing her medications. She was hospitalized for a long time after she was 52 years old, because she was abandoned by her family. Her psychotic symptoms were improved by small amounts of antipsychotics such as 2 mg risperidone. When she was 53 years old, she suffered from short-stepping gait, finger tremors, bradykinesia, and a dexterity movement disorder despite a reduction in the amount of risperidone. She was diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s disease and prescribed <sc>l</sc>-dopa. When she was 63 years old, she suffered from an episode of unconsciousness and was diagnosed with epilepsy after electroencephalography, magnetic resonance angiography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. She was then prescribed the antiepileptic drugs valproic acid and clonazepam. However, the seizure discharges were not detected by electroencephalography. When she was 73 years old, she suffered from sepsis with unknown etiology despite several diagnostic tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an SCZ patient with a loss of function variant in the <italic>ADK</italic> region identified in a whole-genome CNV study in a Japanese cohort of samples comprising 1699 SCZ and 824 controls (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Kushima et al., 2017</xref>). The search for the breakpoint revealed that 6 exons (from exon 3 to exon 8) were deleted and that deletion of <italic>ADK</italic> is a result of the loss of function variant (frame shift). The protein resulting from this deletion may be a nonsense protein that is degraded. Considering that <italic>ADK</italic> expression in this patient with <italic>ADK</italic> deletion was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and that the pattern of expression in the Human Transcriptome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hbatlas.org/">http://hbatlas.org/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2011</xref>) indicates that ADK is highly expressed from the posterior brain regions in the human fetus to the adult human brain (supplemental Figure 3), ADK in this SCZ patient may not have been expressed from the early fetal period. Furthermore, considering that <italic>ADK</italic> had a high haploinsufficiency score (3.41) in the DECIFER database (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Firth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), the ADK protein may not be fully functional in this schizophrenic patient.</p><p>Interestingly, this patient with <italic>ADK</italic> deficiency presented with several phenotypes such as SCZ, epilepsy, and Parkinsonism. Therefore, considering the loss of function mutation and the reduced expression of <italic>ADK</italic> mRNA, the phenotypes described here may have arisen in part because of this deletion in the region of <italic>ADK</italic>. The patient did not have a clear phenotype related to liver dysfunction as a former study about <italic>ADK</italic> deficiency showed (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Staufner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, because this variant is rare, detecting a statistical association in the loss of function variant of <italic>ADK</italic> will be difficult. Second, we did not perform biochemical assays with samples from this patient with <italic>ADK</italic> deletion to evaluate the ability of the remaining ADK enzyme to convert adenosine to adenosine monophosphate (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Staufner et al., 2016</xref>). Third, we did not have sufficient DNA from family members of the patient, which prevented us from analyzing segregation of the variant. Fourth, in the case summary of this carrier with the <italic>ADK</italic> deletion, we were unable to obtain detailed clinical information for the developmental period and electroencephalography data; therefore, we could not fully evaluate the effect of the discovered rare mutation.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified and reported a case with a loss of function variant of <italic>ADK</italic> with the same phenotypes predicted by a study of adenosine (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Boison et al., 2012</xref>). For future studies, we should collect many more cases with the loss of function variant of <italic>ADK</italic> to subtype and elucidate the etiopathophysiology of this neuropsychiatric disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>Dr. N.
