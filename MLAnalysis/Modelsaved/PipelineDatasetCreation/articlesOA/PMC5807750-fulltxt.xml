In the southern region of the country, this disease presents the highest rates of hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In older adults, stroke is the second cause of death and the most prevalent cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In Brazil, approximately 50% of older adults affected by stroke survive. These adults require assistance for daily activities and they are cared for by their own family at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The family caregivers face difficulties related to the instrumental, emotional and financial support and also the lack of knowledge and skills to perform the activities of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Support programs for caregivers after hospital discharge have demonstrated beneficial effects when structured in training interventions for family caregivers so that stroke survivors can receive proper care at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These interventions are associated with the reduction of the caregiver&#8217;s burden and the improvement of their quality of life (QofL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">A structured model of home care for caregivers of stroke survivors after hospital discharge is non-existent in Brazil. However, because of the aging population and the need to reduce hospital costs, it is necessary to discuss national health policies directed toward home care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Currently, discharge planning with adequate transition of care is not a reality in most hospital institutions and the patients return home without receiving adequate orientation and information on post-discharge care. These aspects may leads to major risks for readmission in hospitals and demands on the emergency services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In Brazil, the home care policy determines that the health professionals, who are part of the home care teams, provide assistance for the users, being responsible for training the caregivers and involving them in the care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, although Brazilian public health policies define the formation of a health care network, they present fragility, lack of transition of care and inefficient health services in home care for stroke survivors and their caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a consequence, the responsibility for the care of stroke survivors rests with the family and with an informal network of community members.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Care and assistance for daily life activities of the stroke survivors is often unexpected.

This context contributes to the high level of caregiver burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], also influencing the worsening of their QofL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, without guidance, care for the aged cannot be expected to be understood and performed correctly by the caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], contributing to the consequent hospital readmissions of the older adults and the complications of negligent home care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The acquisition of knowledge by the caregiver is not arbitrary, but rather acquired through the guidance of a health professional at the time of hospital discharge or when returning to the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Considering a confidence level of 0.95, a statistical power of 0.80, a minimum effect size of 0.9 standard deviations between the groups regarding the burden and QofL, and a sample loss of 20%, the sample was calculated in 48 patients. There was a fair division between the two groups, with 24 patients in the IG and 24 patients in the CG. The statistical calculation was performed by the program WinPepi version 11.32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par60">The analysis will be performed by intention-to-treat, where data from all participants (stroke survivors and their family caregivers) will be used regardless of the time they participated in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Quantitative variables will be expressed as means and standard deviations or median and interquartile range. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess the distributions of the continuous outcomes.

In addition, randomization means that there are no systematic biases regarding the subjects&#8217; allocation, since it ensures that it is random, minimizing the influence of confounding variables. Blinding is also critical, as it controls for cointerventions and bias outcome evaluations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par62">With the aging population, stroke has increasingly affected older adults, causing functional and cognitive consequences that make these people dependent on care for their activities of daily living. Family caregivers will have to perform care activities, often in a sudden way, in addition to dealing with all the changes that this situation generates in the family organization at home. Thus, it is necessary to orientate the family caregivers to perform these activities, so as to offer support that provides greater security and knowledge, and also manages their emotions and reorganizes the family context in front of the dependent stroke survivor.</p><p id="Par63">SHARE is an unpublished study in Brazil, the first one being conducted with family caregivers of older adult stroke survivors. Despite national concerns about the quality of health care, coverage and access to services, the recent proposal for home care and instrumentalization of family caregivers is still incipient. Statistically significant results are expected to demonstrate the reduction of the level of burden and the improvement of the QofL of family caregivers of the older adults stroke survivors. As a secondary outcome, it is also believed that the stroke survivors will improve their functional capacity, reducing the use of the emergency services. Furthermore, the SHARE intervention will promote the use of primary health care services, and hospital readmissions can be avoided.</p><p id="Par64">Several studies have suggested the implementation of interventions that orientate family caregivers in the home context, offering education for the development of technical skills and emotional support, since these are considered more effective in reducing the burden and improving the QofL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In addition, they also have a positive effect on reducing the use of services and hospital readmissions, since they improve the abilities of caregivers to perform the activities necessary for the adequate care of the older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">In this study, outcomes were selected that demonstrate the positive effects of home interventions, both for patients and caregivers, and for the health system. The expected results provide policymakers with information for the strengthening of home care policy. This implies less use of financial resources with hospitalizations and frequent use of emergency health services, both by the stroke survivors and their family caregivers, who may also become sick without adequate support.</p><p id="Par66">It is also considered that the method of this study is robust and adequate to evaluate the effect of educational intervention to family caregivers of the stroke survivors, besides offering important information for the implementation of SHARE in the context of the Brazilian health system. At the moment, the study is in the phase of data collection with an expected end in July 2017.</p><p id="Par67">Possible limitations to this study may include the loss of follow-up due to the death of the stroke survivors, hospitalization in long-term institutions or caregivers exchange, as well as the hiring of formal caregivers. Despite this, the studies developed with this approach in the international context are limited and they are unpublished in the national (Brazilian) context. The present study will contribute to necessary information for future research.</p><p id="Par68">From this RCT it will be possible to provide scientific arguments for the implementation of educational nursing intervention to family caregivers of stroke survivors at home. It is expected that there will be a reduction of the family caregivers&#8217; burden, improvement in their QofL, as well as a decrease in the hospital readmission of the older adults and use of the health services of the stroke survivors and their family caregivers. In addition, this study will provide support for the strengthening of public policies directed to home care and to family caregivers of dependent stroke survivors.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par69">The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 3 June 2016 with identification number NCT02807012. The data recruitment began in May 2016. At the moment, caregivers and stroke survivors have been recruited and the SHARE intervention has been carried out. The recruitment will be completed in December 2017.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
