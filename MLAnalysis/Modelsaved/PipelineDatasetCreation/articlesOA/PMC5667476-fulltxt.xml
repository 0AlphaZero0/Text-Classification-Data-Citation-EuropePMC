Reactive focal test and treat (RFTAT) using rapid diagnostic tests and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) has been key in making this progress. Reactive focal drug administration (RFDA) using dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAP), may be superior in accelerating clearance of the parasite reservoir in humans due to the provision of enhanced chemoprophylactic protection of at-risk populations against new infections. The primary aim of this study is to quantify the relative effectiveness of RFDA with DHAP against RFTAT with AL (standard of care) for reducing <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> prevalence and incidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The study will be conducted in four districts in Southern Province, Zambia; an area of low malaria transmission and high coverage of vector control. A community randomized controlled trial of 16 health facility catchment areas will be used to evaluate the impact of sustained year-round routine RFDA for 2&#160;years, relative to a control of year-round routine RFTAT. Reactive case detection will be triggered by a confirmed malaria case, e.g., by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test at any government health facility. Reactive responses will be performed by community health workers (CHW) within 7&#160;days of the index case confirmation date. Responses will be performed out to a radius of 140&#160;m from the index case household. A subset of responses will be followed longitudinally for 90&#160;days to examine reinfection rates. Primary outcomes include a post-intervention survey of malaria seropositivity (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;4800 children aged 1&#160;month to under 5&#160;years old) and a difference-in-differences analysis of malaria parasite incidence, as measured through routine passive case detection at health facilities enrolled in the study.

Despite these sobering figures, in the last decade multi-pronged malaria control primarily consisting of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has dramatically reduced mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Emboldened by this progress, the newly launched Zambia National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan (2017&#8211;2021) calls for the ambitious elimination of malaria throughout the country by 2021 using a prescribed set of vector control and treatment interventions based on epidemiologic thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As part of this package of interventions, enhanced malaria surveillance including reactive case detection, has been expanded to cover a large portion of Southern Province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], an area with a documented decline in malaria prevalence to below&#160;10% in children under 5&#160;years of age during Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) conducted in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The enhanced surveillance data suggests that some areas within Southern Province are candidates for eliminating malaria and documenting zero transmission; however, questions remain about the strategies required to move from very low to zero transmission as well as how to document zero transmission.</p><p id="Par24">Implementing and maintaining a high-quality surveillance and passive case detection (PCD) system throughout the target population is critical to eliminating transmission of infectious disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Even with universal access to malaria diagnosis and treatment, however, PCD will not identify asymptomatic infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Reactive case detection is a method to identify and clear these hidden reservoirs, which tend to cluster spatially within a population, and around known symptomatic, malaria-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In areas of low transmission, incident malaria cases presenting to a PCD system can, therefore, be used as an indicator of local malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and can be used to target a specific geographical areas where the probability of additional infected individuals is higher than in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In Southern Province, a reactive focal test and treat (RFTAT) strategy to reduce foci of infection has been implemented by the National Malaria Control Program since 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Briefly, this strategy consists of testing all individuals within 140&#160;m of a diagnostically confirmed incident malaria case and then treating all positive individuals with artemether-lumefantrine (AL), or referring for further clinical care as appropriate. In Zambia, this strategy has been termed Step D as it comprises the community-level surveillance and response system as part of a stepwise approach to elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite Step D being associated with a 30% increase in surveillance system sensitivity and a concomitant 6.5% reduction in outpatient attendance (Larsen et al. under review), questions remain about the implications of using an imperfect diagnostic test to direct treatment, the limited chemoprophylaxis provided when using AL and the overall effectiveness of the activities in reducing malaria transmission to zero.</p><p id="Par26">In low-transmission settings, as many as 80% of malaria infections may not be detectable by microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) which have a similar limit of detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The current RFTAT approach in the Step D intervention misses these sub-patent infections during reactions; however, identifying and treating these sub-patent infections is likely to be key in accelerating the interruption of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An RFTAT-based approach will not only fail to identify and treat some malaria infections in the population living near an incident malaria case, but this approach also misses the opportunity to protect the local at-risk population around the incident malaria case through chemoprophylaxis. With malaria circulating in and around a location, chemoprophylaxis is likely an important piece for accelerating elimination. Indeed the chemoprophylaxis provided by mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns have been modeled as a principle driver for impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. MDA maximizes chemoprophylactic protection while avoiding missing sub-patent malaria infections by delivering a therapeutic antimalarial dose to the entire target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; and has had notable success in eliminating malaria from island populations, e.g., Aneityum, Vanuatu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], been widely implemented in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and has shown initial success in southern Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Concerns over efficacy, cost and the emergence of drug resistance have tempered its use. Nevertheless, MDA has led to success with other neglected tropical diseases and a recent Cochrane review supports the exploration of MDA as another tool in the arsenal in the quest for malaria elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Because prophylaxis is the principle driver for impact of MDA, the choice of drug in an MDA approach is crucial. Artemisinins have short half-lives that are measured in hours; therefore, partner drugs are typically selected for their longer-lasting effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of the two drugs approved as first-line treatments in Zambia the lumefantrine component of AL has a half-life of 4&#8211;6 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while the piperaquine component of DHAP has a half-life of 28&#160;days or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">This trial will investigate whether RFDA with DHAP represents a superior intervention to RFTAT with AL in clearing and maintaining a reduced parasite reservoir in human infections and ultimately in achieving and maintaining zero malaria transmission. The primary aims are to assess these interventions using confirmed malaria incidence, longitudinal follow-ups during reactive responses and endline serology profiling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par28">The study will be conducted in Southern Province, Zambia in 16 health facility catchment areas (HFCA) in four districts, namely Kalomo, Monze, Mazabuka and Pemba (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

As with the rest of Zambia, malaria transmission is seasonal, peaking in April/May shortly after the end of the rainy season. ITN coverage, defined as at least one ITN per household, for the province is high at 77.8%. ITNs are supplemented with IRS, with much lower, but increasing levels of coverage using the organophosphate pirimiphos methyl which remains a highly effective insecticide in the area. Malaria testing and treatment is free to the public at all government-sponsored health facilities and in these rural districts access to malaria testing and treatment in the private market is minimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DHAP)</title><p id="Par30">In the intervention arm, all consenting research participants will receive a treatment dose of DHAP.

This research will, therefore, only alter the details of the reactive response in the RFDA intervention arm. Despite these apparent small changes to the community expected response, and to encourage high levels of participation and adherence, several sensitization activities were conducted. Firstly, information about this research, the treatments and the process were shared through the Ministry of Health. Secondly, sensitization meetings were held with chiefs and their headmen to inform key community leaders and ensure that information filtered down through the traditional community leadership structures. During CHW trainings, all clinic-based supervisors and in-charges were also invited to attend to learn about the study. Information materials were adapted from another MDA study in Southern Province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and will be distributed during community sensitization meetings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par37">A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the impact of sustained RFDA with DHAP versus RFTAT with AL at reducing malaria parasite seropositivity and malaria incidence at the HFCA population level, as well as reducing reinfection in the population treated during reactive case detection. Communities, or clusters, are defined by HFCAs and serve as the unit of randomization. HFCAs were selected based on having a mean monthly incident malaria case load of less than 25 (absolute count) and a mean test positivity during historical Step D reactive case detection of 5% or more. A total of 16 health facilities and their catchment areas are included in the study, each of which is randomly allocated to either the control or intervention arm. Blinding is not possible with this study design due to supervision needs of CHWs. However, all analysis will be blinded by the use of a concealed study code for the study arm.</p><p id="Par38">Evaluating an intervention in a pre-elimination setting is exceptionally challenging. By definition, transmission and, therefore, outcomes to be evaluated are extremely low. The small numbers in potential outcomes means that traditional methodologies typically employed to evaluate malaria interventions, e.g., with human landing catches to measure the entomological inoculation rate or sampling the parasite prevalence in a human population, are not appropriate. Measuring transmission in a pre-elimination setting, therefore, requires new tools. Molecular genotyping, e.g., with a barcode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], can expand the amount of data that can be extracted from a single identified infection. For example, relationships between individual infections with the same or a related barcode can be inferred. Furthermore, at the population level, the overall genetic diversity can inform transmission levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This rich granular data may allow local transmission patterns to be dissected, but it still requires samples to be collected during an infection. Additionally, serology looks at the cumulative exposure of an individual to malaria. The production of an immune response to any antigen is a function of antigen exposure, the ability of an antigen to provoke an immune response (antigen immunogenicity), and the decay rate of the antibody response. Assuming that all individuals in a population share the same exposure risk, and that the immunogenicity of different parasite strains is comparable, then the likelihood of converting from being seronegative to seropositive increases with age. By calculating the age-specific seroconversion rates at two time points, one can measure whether transmission has increased or decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, by using multiple antigens with different decay rates or immunogenicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], windows of exposure can be defined. Ultimately, serology can be, and has been, used to document malaria elimination, e.g., in Greece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Finally, serology can be used to model the entomological inoculation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which otherwise would not be possible to define given the levels of transmission in the area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p id="Par39">Primary outcomes used to measures the impact of the intervention versus the control are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par40">

The aim will be to obtain a representative sample of children (aged&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;1&#160;month to&#8201;&lt;&#8201;5&#160;years) to determine the first primary outcome (seropositivity). A complete enumeration and geo-referencing of all households in the study area, with a 3-km buffer applied around the location of each health facility will serve as the sampling frame. This buffer will mitigate contamination between the control and intervention arms. Using satellite enumerated households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as a sampling frame, a simple random sample of households will then be drawn within each of the 16 HFCAs (equal allocation sampling), to obtain the total sample size of 2820 households. Selected households will be visited by trained survey data collectors who will administer a standardized survey questionnaire, adapted from the standard national malaria indicator survey questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], loaded onto mobile devices. A dried blood spot will be prepared from a finger prick for all children sleeping in the household the previous night where consent has been given, and will be used to measure seropositivity by ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) and parasite prevalence by PCR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Routine health Information</title><p id="Par49">In 2011, a routine aggregate reporting system utilizing District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) was established. Reporting to this system is performed via data-enabled mobile phones with data available to be viewed through a password-protected website. At the health facility, data are reported weekly and include reporting on clinical and laboratory-confirmed malaria cases, total outpatients, RDT stock levels, etc. At the level of the CHW health post, data is reported monthly and includes information on RDT-confirmed cases from both passive and reactive case detection. From this database we will generate a time-series dataset to evaluate the second primary outcome. We will standardize total malaria cases and confirmed malaria cases two ways for each HFCA: by estimated mid-year populations and monthly total outpatient attendance. The Ministry of Health together with local partners have been implementing a standard data quality auditing process in these districts since 2013 to improve the overall quality of surveillance data from health facilities and health posts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Longitudinal cohort</title><p id="Par50">A number of the reactive responses will be selected for longitudinal follow-up, using a convenient sample with, where possible, equal geographical representation. Individuals enrolled in this cohort will be visited on days 1, 3, 30 and 90 by study teams in addition to the responding CHW. With the exception of day 3, where only the modified DOT compliance will be recorded, a standard questionnaire will be administered and a dried blood spot collected at each time point from each participant (see Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> for a summary of interactions and activities at each time point). Dried blood spots will be used to detect the presence of malaria parasites by PCR to evaluate primary outcomes 3 and 4. To encourage retention, where available, PCR results from previous visits will be shared. PCR-positive, RDT-negative individuals will be offered an additional RDT test on subsequent visits.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Summary schematic of interactions for participants enrolled in the longitudinal study. <italic>mRDT</italic> malaria rapid diagnostic test, <italic>HC</italic> health center, <italic>HP</italic> health post, <italic>AL</italic> artemether-lumefantrine, <italic>DBS</italic> dried blood spot, <italic>DOT</italic> direct observed therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2249_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig>

These outcomes will be measured using PCR, and assuming an 8% parasite prevalence rate as measured by RDT we presume approximately 15% parasite prevalence rate as measured by PCR. No data were available to estimate a coefficient of variation for these outcomes, so we conservatively use a coefficient of variation of 0.5 for the power calculations. With these assumptions the 16 clusters will allow us to measure a 65.4% and 67.4% decrease in parasite clearance 3&#160;days following the case investigation and reinfection 90&#160;days following the case investigation, respectively, with 80% power and 95% specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p id="Par55">To estimate the impact of the RFDA intervention for primary outcome one (malaria parasite exposure through seropositivity) we will employ a mixed-effects regression model with the health center as a random intercept.

As the analysis is intended to be incremental, existing infrastructure and recurrent inputs that would be present in the absence of the intervention will not be costed. The emphasis of the cost analysis is on determining the cost of RFDA or RFTAT alone, and not assessing the cost of training CHWs in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria nor in the follow-up visits to areas receiving reactive responses. Cost-effectiveness will be measured through incident malaria cases averted as measured through the difference in malaria incidence at health centers in the control versus the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Quality control and secondary studies</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Importation of infections</title><p id="Par60">All malaria infections will be geo-referenced during data collection.

The procedure is capable of analyzing multi-variate gene outcomes including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The number of separate genetic populations in the study area will be estimated and mapped; migrants (<italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections dissimilar genetically from others in nearby space) will be classified as imported malaria cases without onward transmission and will also be identified and mapped.

Effective interventions must also be scalable, sustainable and affordable in order for Zambia to achieve and maintain elimination. This study will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RFDA to the current intervention of RFTAT with the aim of moving from very low levels of malaria transmission to hopefully zero transmission. RFDA is scalable, affordable and sustainable as demonstrated by ongoing RFTAT in Southern Province, Zambia. Data from this study will provide key evidence necessary to determine if RFDA is a tool that can help more quickly achieve the long-term goal of elimination.</p><p id="Par68">This cluster randomized control trial is rigorously designed to assess both the impact of parasite clearance at the population level, through routine health facility malaria incidence data and an endline survey, as well as clearance at the level of individual reactive responses, through longitudinal cohort data. By measuring serology as well as prevalence the endline survey will not only provide evidence that transmission is increasing or decreasing, but is designed to robustly identify and document the absence of transmission. To minimize potential contamination during the endline survey households will be sampled within a 3-km buffer from the health facility.</p><p id="Par69">The quality of the implementation of the intervention and control arm will be measured by target population coverage, adherence to the protocol and acceptability of the study. In-depth longitudinal cohorts will also give an idea of the reintroduction rate of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria following RFTAT and RFDA and the environmental factors that might facilitate that. Reintroduction poses a significant threat to the endgame of malaria eradication and this study will give insight into factors affecting the rate of reintroduction at the micro scale.</p><p id="Par70">A significant challenge for the study is the scarcity of outcomes (both confirmed malaria incidence and malaria parasite prevalence) in the study HFCAs. When evaluating the impact of malaria elimination strategies sample sizes become prohibitively large.
