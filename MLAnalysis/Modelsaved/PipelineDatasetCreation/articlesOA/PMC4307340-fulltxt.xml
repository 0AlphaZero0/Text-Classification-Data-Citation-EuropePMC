High concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the most effective treatments to remove astringency of persimmon fruit owing to the action of the accumulated anoxia metabolite acetaldehyde. In model plants, <italic>NAC</italic> genes have been identified as being responsive to low oxygen. However, the possible relationship between NAC transcription factors and persimmon astringency removal remains unexplored. In the present research, treatment with a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (95%) effectively removed astringency of &#8220;Mopan&#8221; persimmon fruit by causing decreases in soluble tannin. Acetaldehyde content increased in response to CO<sub>2</sub> treatment concomitantly with astringency removal.

Introduction</title><p>Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are secondary metabolites and phenolic oligomers that result from the condensation of flavan-3-ol units. PAs have a variety of uses and are beneficial for human health owing to their antioxidant properties, which include anti-allergic, anti-tumor, anti-aging properties, and the prevention of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B1-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, they can be used to detoxicate snake venom and have been used to adsorb radioactive compounds from nuclear waste and recycle the heavy metals from electronic waste [<xref rid="B4-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Persimmon (<italic>Diospyros kaki</italic>) is a unique fruit that accumulates PAs in abundance [<xref rid="B8-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Persimmon fruit can be divided into astringent and nonastringent types, and most of the commercial cultivars in China are of the astringent type [<xref rid="B9-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Astringent persimmons accumulate abundant PAs in the fruit flesh even at maturity and soluble PAs cause astringency, which severely affects the industry and consumer acceptance [<xref rid="B9-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, astringency removal is critical for the persimmon industry.</p><p>Due to the importance of astringency removal for commercial production, a range of technologies has been developed, such as CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B11-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and alternate freezing and thawing [<xref rid="B14-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among these, high concentration CO<sub>2</sub> treatment is very commonly used and its underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms of astringency removal are much more clearly understood than for the other treatments. It has been suggested that acetaldehyde, which accumulates during anaerobic respiration induced by high CO<sub>2</sub>, causes soluble tannins to become insoluble during the treatment, thus reducing astringency [<xref rid="B16-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) enzyme activities increased during deastringency and this was associated with acetaldehyde biosynthesis [<xref rid="B17-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our previous results indicated that ADH and PDC enzyme were both induced by CO<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> treatments, and <italic>DkADH1</italic>, <italic>DkPDC1</italic>, <italic>DkPDC2</italic> and <italic>DkPDC3</italic> expression was up-regulated in response to both ethylene and high CO<sub>2</sub> treatments [<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When <italic>DkPDC2</italic> was transiently over-expressed in persimmon leaves, they showed a lower level of soluble tannins, compared with leaves infiltrated with an empty vector, suggesting that <italic>DkPDC2</italic> is a key gene regulating soluble tannins and astringency removal [<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results suggested CO<sub>2</sub> driven astringency removal requires acetaldehyde metabolism, brought about by modulation of ADH and PDC enzymes and genes. However, understanding of the molecular basis of persimmon astringency removal is still limited.</p><p>In model plants, a few transcription factors have been reported to be involved in the hypoxia response, such as NAC and ethylene response factors (<italic>ERF</italic>) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As mentioned above, persimmon fruit astringency removal by CO<sub>2</sub> treatment is considered to operate mainly via the hypoxia fermentation pathway. In persimmon fruit, the only transcription factors analyzed during persimmon fruit astringency removal have been the <italic>ERF</italic> gene family. Recently, four <italic>ERF</italic> genes, <italic>DkERF9</italic>, <italic>DkERF10</italic>, <italic>DkERF19</italic> and <italic>DkERF22</italic>, were shown to manifest trans-activation of <italic>DkADH</italic> and <italic>DkPDC</italic> genes [<xref rid="B20-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the relations between other transcription factors and astringency removal have rarely been reported. In addition to <italic>ERFs</italic>, <italic>NAC</italic> genes are the main transcription factors reported to be involved in the plant hypoxia response, which indicated their potential to be involved in persimmon astringency removal. The NAC designation is based on highly conserved consensus sequences in the <italic>N</italic>-terminal region of a Petunia gene (NAM), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ATAF1/2 and CUC2 proteins [<xref rid="B21-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More than 100 <italic>NAC</italic> genes have been identified and characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B22-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among them, <italic>ANAC019</italic>, <italic>ANAC055</italic> and <italic>ANAC072</italic> enhanced tolerance to drought stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B23-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and <italic>ANAC2</italic> is involved in response to plant hormones [<xref rid="B24-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, <italic>ANAC102</italic> was shown to be induced by low oxygen (0.1%), and overexpression of <italic>ANAC102</italic> up-regulated <italic>ADH</italic> expression [<xref rid="B19-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since treatment with a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> triggered expression of <italic>ADH</italic>/<italic>PDC</italic> genes and acetaldehyde metabolism in persimmon, this suggested that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> low oxygen responsive transcription factors such as <italic>ANAC102</italic> had the potential to be involved in astringency removal, but experimental evidence for this was lacking in persimmon.</p><p>In the present research, six <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes were isolated from &#8220;Mopan&#8221; persimmon fruit based on differentially expressed genes (DEG) in an RNA-seq database using Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology. High CO<sub>2</sub> (95%) treatment was applied to the fruit and <italic>DkNAC</italic> transcripts were analyzed during the deastringency process. Some <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes were found to be positively correlated with persimmon fruit deastringency, and the possible roles of these and other <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>2.1. Fruit Deastringency</title><p>The soluble tannin content remained almost constant during storage in the control fruit, whereas in contrast, the CO<sub>2</sub> treatment caused a rapid decrease in the concentration of soluble tannin from 0.917% at day 0% to 0.229% at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-16-01894-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Soluble tannins content was measured both by the Folin phenol method, and also visualized by tannin printing, using filter paper soaked with 5% FeCl<sub>2</sub>. The extent, and location, of soluble tannin content was revealed by the tissue printing, and was substantially lower in CO<sub>2</sub> treated fruit, compared with control fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-16-01894-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Acetaldehyde, the main compound responsible for insolublization of soluble tannin, was also analyzed. The results indicated that there was a very obvious increase (approx. five fold) in acetaldehyde accumulation in CO<sub>2</sub> treated fruit one day after the start of treatment. However, such differences were abolished, following cessation of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-16-01894-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>By utilizing soluble tannin and tanning printing assays, 95% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment was shown to be effective in inducing deastringency in postharvest &#8220;Mopan&#8221; cultivar persimmon. These results confirm and extend our previous findings [<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and other reports using various persimmon cultivars [<xref rid="B11-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A burst of acetaldehyde production during deastringency treatment has been widely reported in various persimmon cultivars, such as &#8220;<italic>Rojo Brillante</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic>Kaki Tipo</italic>&#8221;, &#8220;<italic>Lycopersicon</italic>&#8221; [<xref rid="B25-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde further supports the role and effectiveness of 95% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment on persimmon fruit deastringency.</p><fig id="ijms-16-01894-f001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of CO<sub>2</sub> treatment on soluble tannin of &#8220;Mopan&#8221; fruit at 20 &#176;C.

Alignment of the six DkNAC proteins showed that they shared a highly conserved <italic>N</italic>-terminal region, containing five consensus subdomains, which are termed the NAC domains [<xref rid="B27-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>NAC</italic> genes have been classified previously into two groups based on similarities of NAC domain structures in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and rice [<xref rid="B27-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Group I proteins are composed of 14 subgroups, including TERN, ONAC022, SENU5, NAP, AtNAC3, ATAF, OsNAC3, NAC2, ANAC011, TIP, OsNAC8, OsNAC7, NAC1 and NAM, and group II can be divided into four subgroups, namely ANAC011, ONAC003, ONAC001 and ANAC063 [<xref rid="B27-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>DkNAC1</italic> and <italic>DkNAC6</italic> belong to group I (ATAF subfamily)<italic>.

Unlike <italic>DkNAC1/3/5/6</italic>, transcripts of <italic>DkNAC2</italic> increased at four days (three days after treatment was stopped). Unlike the other <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes, the expression of <italic>DkNAC4</italic> was decreased during CO<sub>2</sub> treatment and then recovered by day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-16-01894-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="ijms-16-01894-f006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Transcriptional analysis of <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes.

This indicates that in persimmons, expression of <italic>DkNAC1</italic>, <italic>DkNAC3</italic>, <italic>DkNAC5</italic> and <italic>DkNAC6</italic> is highly correlated with fruit deastringency. The expression pattern of <italic>DkNAC1</italic> and <italic>DkNAC6</italic> further supported the prediction from phylogenetic and structural analyses, that <italic>ANAC102</italic> homologs might be important regulators of the hypoxia response, which benefit deastringency in persimmon fruit. Besides <italic>DkNAC1</italic> and <italic>DkNAC6</italic>, <italic>DkNAC3</italic> and <italic>DkNAC5</italic> were also observed to increase in expression in response to 95% CO<sub>2</sub> treatment; however, <italic>DkNAC3</italic> and <italic>DkNAC5</italic> belong to the NAP subfamily and group II, respectively. These results may indicate that more subfamilies might be involved in the deastringency response in persimmon fruit and more generally in the hypoxia response in plants. Although hypoxia-responsive <italic>NAC</italic> genes have rarely been reported, the results from the studies on <italic>ANAC102</italic> also indicated that additional <italic>NAC</italic> genes might exist for the hypoxia response, as <italic>ANAC102</italic> knockout lines did not show altered <italic>ADH</italic> gene transcription in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B19-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Taken together, results from persimmon and previous finding in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicate that additional <italic>NAC</italic> genes are potentially involved in the hypoxia response in plants.</p><p>In addition to the four above-mentioned <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes, <italic>DkNAC2</italic> and <italic>DkNAC4</italic> expression also exhibited interesting features. Unlike the positively regulated NAC genes, <italic>DkNAC4</italic> mRNA levels were negatively correlated with astringency removal. Nevertheless, no repressive domain, such as an EAR motif, was observed within the coding region of DkNAC4. The increase in <italic>DkNAC2</italic> mRNA occurred on the third day after treatment was removed, after the fruit had lost their astringency and started to senescence. These results indicated that <italic>DkNAC2</italic> might be involved in fruit ripening or senescence-related processes, but not astringency removal. Similar results were also reported in other fruit, such as banana, where transcripts of <italic>MaNAC1</italic> and <italic>MaNAC2</italic> were up-regulated in banana post-harvest ripening, and it was suggested that <italic>MaNAC</italic> genes may be involved in banana fruit ripening via interaction with ethylene signalling components [<xref rid="B31-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was also reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> siliques that <italic>AtNAP</italic>, a <italic>NAC</italic> gene whose expression increased with the progression of silique senescence, played a key role in its senescence [<xref rid="B32-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3. Experimental Section</title><sec><title>3.1. Materials and Treatments</title><p>The &#8220;Mopan&#8221; (astringent cultivar) persimmon fruit were harvested from a commercial orchard (Fangshan, Beijing) in 2013, with mean firmness of 47 N, and then transported to the laboratory the next day. Fruits with no defects and uniform size were chosen for treatment. CO<sub>2</sub> (95%) and control treatments were performed according to our previous report [<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (Min <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012). After firmness measurement at each sampling point, fruit flesh was removed from the peel and shredded, then frozen with liquid nitrogen and kept in &#8722;80 &#176;C refrigerator until required.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2. Soluble Tannins Assay and Tannin Printing</title><p>The content of soluble tannins, the most important index for astringency, was measured using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the method described in our previous report [<xref rid="B14-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012).</p><p>The printing method, a convenient way of identifying persimmon astringency location and loss, was also used for the examination of soluble tannins in the fruit flesh according to [<xref rid="B33-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, (2013). Filter papers were soaked with 5% FeCl<sub>2</sub> for about 5&#8211;10 min, then moved to a 60 &#176;C oven until dry. The whole fruit was cut into two parts and printed on the processed filter paper. The black color indicated soluble tannins and the intensity of black reflected the soluble tannins content.</p></sec><sec><title>3.3. Acetaldehyde Determination</title><p>Acetaldehyde production was determined with a gas chromatograph Instrument (Agilent 6890N, Folsom, CA, USA) with a FID column (HP-INNOWAX, 0.25 mm, 30 m, 0.25 &#956;m, Agilent J&amp;W, Folsom, CA, USA) according to the method described previously [<xref rid="B20-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (Min <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014) with some modification. The injector, detector and oven temperatures were 150, 160, and 100 &#176;C, respectively. Sec-butyl alcohol was added to each vial as an internal control. The results were calculated using standard curves for acetaldehyde and ethanol, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>3.4. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis</title><p>Total RNA was prepared according to the method used previously [<xref rid="B18-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (Min <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012). Traces of contaminating genomic DNA in total RNA were removed with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). One microgram DNA-free RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. For each sampling point, three biological replicates were used for RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>3.5. Gene Isolation and Sequence Analysis</title><p>The <italic>NAC</italic> genes were isolated based on RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq was performed by the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) (Shenzhen, China) according to our previous paper [<xref rid="B20-ijms-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (Min <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was chosen to amplify the 3' and/or 5' end Untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>NAC</italic>, using a SMART&#8482; RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The sequences of primers used for RACE are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-16-01894-t001">Table 1</xref>. The gene sequences were translated with online software (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/translate/">http://web.expasy.org/translate/</uri>) and were confirmed with the BLAST methods in Genbank.

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, soluble tannins and acetaldehyde assay results showed that a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> treatment was effective in inducing deastringency of &#8220;Mopan&#8221; persimmon fruit. Six <italic>DkNAC</italic> genes were isolated and the transcriptional level of <italic>DkNAC1</italic>, <italic>DkNAC3</italic>, <italic>DkNAC5</italic> and <italic>DkNAC6</italic> were highly correlated with fruit deastringency. Finally, <italic>DkNAC1/3/5/6</italic> are identified as prime candidates for further transcriptional regulatory analysis in persimmon fruit to understand the molecular control of astringency removal.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (no. 201203047), National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31372114), Program of International Science and Technology Cooperation (2011DFB31580) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (no. 2014QNA6015).</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Ting Min, Xue-Ren Yin and Kun-Song Chen participated in the design of the study; Ting Min, Miao-Miao Wang, Fang Fang and Xiaofen Liu participated in carrying out the experiments; Ting Min, Xue-Ren Yin and Xiaofen Liu participated in data analysis; Ting Min and Hongxun Wang and Xue-Ren Yin participated in drafting the manuscript; Xue-Ren Yin, Kun-Song Chen, Hongxun Wang and Donald Grierson read and approved the final manuscript.</p></notes><notes><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-ijms-16-01894"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
