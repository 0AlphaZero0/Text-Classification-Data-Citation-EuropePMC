</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Muscle contraction is triggered by the rapid entry of calcium, a ubiquitous and diverse signaling molecule, into the muscle cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, cytosolic levels of calcium need to be reliably and accurately regulated both spatially and temporally for effective muscle contraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The sacromere contains several giant proteins, including titin, nebulin and obscurin, which are hypothesized to be critical components involved in sarcomere assembly and organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While both titin and nebulin have been postulated to be molecular scaffolds that have roles in dictating the length of myofilaments [1], [2], the role of obscurin, the most recently discovered giant muscle protein, in sarcomerogenesis and sarcomere function is not well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Obscurin is a member of the twitchin/titin branch of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and is a modular protein composed of several adhesion and signaling domains [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Obscurin predominantly localizes to the M-line where it participates in myofilament assembly and organization [3]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, a recent study has shown that mice homozygous for an obscurin deletion allele display normal sarcomeric organization [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Yet, a small obscurin isoform containing a tandem kinase domain (known as KIAA1639) [10], [11], was still expressed in the obscurin knock out mice [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition, a close homolog of obscurin, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1), which only contains Ig domains, still localized normally to the M-line [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that obsl1 and the small tandem kinase isoform of obscurin might compensate for the absence of full length obscurin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition to its localization to the M-line, obscurin associates with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a key storage organelle for calcium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This association is mediated by a direct interaction of obscurin with the SR membrane protein small Ankyrin 1 [9], [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Disruption of obscurin by small interfering RNAs or knock out of the large obscurin isoform leads to disorganization of the SR [6], [7], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The molecular and physiological consequences of this disorganization are not known. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Unlike mammals, the C. elegans genome contains only one obscurin homolog, UNC-89, which like obscurin localizes to the M-line and has been implicated in myofilament assembly and organization [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Similar to mammalian obscurin, UNC-89 is a giant multi-domain protein consisting primarily of many Ig domains, two fibronectin type 3 domains, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a plekstrin homology (PH) domain, and two protein kinase domains [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have found that UNC-89 is required for normal adult sacromere and SR organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have found that mutants lacking the large Ig domain-rich isoforms of UNC-89 have reduced calcium signaling and reduced muscle activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose that UNC-89 is vital for maintaining muscle cell cytoarchitecture, which is crucial for optimal calcium mobilization and excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in C. elegans muscle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We identified nonsense mutations in both unc-89(ak155) and unc-89(e1460) mutants that introduce stop codons in UNC-89 at Ig repeat 15 and 21, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table S1), which would disrupt the large isoforms (UNC-89A, UNC-89B, UNC-89E, and UNC-89F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The short isoforms, UNC-89C and UNC-89D, are predicted to be intact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the large UNC-89 isoforms are important for the regulation of calcium signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether deletion of the kinase containing isoforms (UNC89B, UNC-89C, UNC-89D and UNC-89F) can suppress egl-19(gf), we utilized unc-89(st79), which contains a stop codon in the Ig domain that lies just N-terminal of the second protein kinase domain (Fig. 2) [17] and unc-89(ok1116), which contains a deletion of the second kinase domain (Fig. 2) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these mutants no longer express UNC-89C and UNC-89D small kinase containing isoforms and unc-89(st79) no longer expresses the large UNC-89B and UNC-89F isoforms [17]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this result, RNA interference (RNAi) of the kinase containing isoforms of unc-89 could not suppress the uncoordinated phenotype of vav-1 over-expression (Fig. 1F), while RNAi of the large UNC-89 isoforms could suppress vav-1 over-expression, confirming our genetic interaction (Fig. 1F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, we used RNAi knockdown of rho-1 in an attempt to suppress egl-19(gf) or over-expression of vav-1. rho-1(RNAi) treatment failed to suppress the egl-19(gf) short hyper-contracted body phenotype (Fig. 1G) and the uncoordinated locomotion associated with over-expression of vav-1 (Fig. 1F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We have found that the large Ig domain-rich isoforms of UNC-89 act as a structural scaffold that maintains the sarcomeres and the SR in the appropriate subcellular configuration for optimal calcium mobilization and E-C coupling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Since both SERCAs and RYRs are mislocalized in unc-89 mutants lacking the large Ig domain-rich isoforms, it is unlikely that UNC-89 directly interacts with these components. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our genetic analysis indicates that UNC-89 acts in a common genetic pathway with EGL-19 L-VGCC and UNC-68 RyR and our calcium imaging data indicates that UNC-89 is critical for optimal calcium signaling the body wall muscle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Twitchin is another giant muscle protein, related to titin and obscurin, which is found in invertebrate muscle where it plays a role in negatively regulating the rate of muscle relaxation [17], [34]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>While several studies have implicated UNC-89 and obscurin in myofilament assembly and organization [3]–[8], [14]–[17], surprisingly a recent characterization of obscurin-null mice has revealed normal sarcomeric structure [9]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This is interesting because in mammals, obscurin is localized to the periphery of the myofibrils where it is thought to link the SR to the sarcomere [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this premise, several muscular dystrophies that arise from mutations in the obsl1 and obscurin binding domain of titin result in the mislocalization of obsl1 and lead to the gradual failure of sarcomere maintenance [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In C. elegans, which do not possess an apparent obsl1 homolog, UNC-89 localizes to the M-line [14]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
