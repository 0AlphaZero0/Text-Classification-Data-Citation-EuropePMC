The short length of miRNA genes and the lack of pronounced sequence features complicate this task. To accommodate the peculiarities of plant and animal miRNAs systems, tools for both systems have evolved differently. However, these tools are biased towards the species for which they were primarily developed and, consequently, their predictive performance on data sets from other species of the same kingdom might be lower. While these biases are intrinsic to the species, their characterization can lead to computational approaches capable of diminishing their negative effect on the accuracy of pre-miRNAs predictive models. We investigate in this study how 45 predictive models induced for data sets from 45 species, distributed in eight subphyla/classes, perform when applied to a species different from the species used in its induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our computational experiments show that the separability of pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre-miRNAs instances is species-dependent and no feature set performs well for all species, even within the same subphylum/class. Mitigating this species dependency, we show that an ensemble of classifiers reduced the classification errors for all 45 species. As the ensemble members were obtained using meaningful, and yet computationally viable feature sets, the ensembles also have a lower computational cost than individual classifiers that rely on energy stability parameters, which are of prohibitive computational cost in large scale applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the combination of multiple pre-miRNAs feature sets and multiple learning biases enhanced the predictive accuracy of pre-miRNAs classifiers of 45 species. This is certainly a promising approach to be incorporated in miRNA discovery tools towards more accurate and less species-dependent tools.</p><p>The material to reproduce the results from this paper can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.49754">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.49754</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1036-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute one of the most widely-studied class of endogenous small (approx. 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs genes, due to their regulatory role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in animals, plants and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The miRNAs biogenesis involves the participation of several enzymes, which depend on the origin (e.g. intergenic or intronic miRNAs) and on the kingdom of the species. However, all miRNAs are processed from long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are processed to hairpin-shaped intermediates (pre-miRNAs) and, subsequently, to the double strand RNA miRNA:miRNA* and a terminal loop. The miRNA* strand is the reverse complement of the functional miRNA, which usually degrades after being unwound by the action of specific enzymes. In the cytoplasm of animal and plant cells, the mature miRNA enters in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to silence target messenger RNAs (tmRNAs) by partial or near-perfect antisense complementarity. Partial antisense complementarity inhibits the translation of tmRNAs, whereas the later causes the degradation of tmRNAs. Reviews on biogenesis, diversification and evolution of miRNAs can be obtained at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>RNAseq methods, followed by computational analysis, became the <italic>de facto</italic> approach for miRNA discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These methods, also called deep sequencing of the transcriptome, can reveal the identities of most RNA species inside a cell, providing tens to hundreds of millions of sequence reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These reads provide both the sequence and the frequency of RNA molecules present in a cell. When applied to detect miRNAs, the RNA material is isolated through a procedure of size selection, such that only small reads (approx. 25 nt long) are sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The computational challenge consists in distinguishing miRNAs from other small RNA (sRNA) types and degradation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The challenge of building a multi-species miRNA prediction tool is reflected in the wide range of sensitivities estimated for eight deep sequencing miRNA prediction tools, when they were applied to data sets from <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>G. Gallus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The sensitivity ranges varied between 24 % and 38 %. For example, the sensitivity of the tool with the highest average sensitivity (68 %) varied between 55 % (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>) and 78 % (<italic>G. Gallus</italic>) and the sensitivity of the tool with lowest average sensitivity (15 %) varied between 0 % (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>) and 25 % (<italic>C. elegans</italic>). The species bias is also present in the analysis performed with miRDeep2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a newer version of miRDeep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which incorporated additional features to increase the detection of known and novel miRNAs in all animal major clades. Even though the average sensitivity of miRDeep2 (80 %) has clearly increased compared to its first version, it still varies depending on the species from 71 % (Sea squirt) to 90 % (Anemone). In order to identify the source of these variabilities, it is imperative to explore how the main factors involved in the development of such computational tools vary throughout species.</p><p>As miRNAs are processed from hairpin regions, computational tools to predict miRNAs from RNA-seq libraries include at least four steps: pre-processing; read mapping to a reference genome; detection of energetically stable hairpins in the genomic region surrounding the mapped read and; detection of miRNAs biogenesis &#8216;signature&#8217;. The latter is derived from the abundance and from the distribution of the reads across the hairpin and is fundamental to reduce false detections, since the hairpin shape structure is a necessary but not sufficient condition to process miRNA. Three criteria have been used as evidence of miRNAs biogenesis: a) the frequency of the mature strand is higher than the frequencies of the corresponding star and loop strands; b) the positions of the Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites in the 5&#8217; ends of the putative miRNA and miRNA* are nearly uniform and; c) the putative miRNA and miRNA* sequences align in the hairpin keeping approximately 2 nt overhang in the 3&#8217; end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, the hairpin analysis is possibly the most critic step affecting negatively the sensitivity of the tools, since the biogenesis signature analysis is performed either after the selection of the energetically most favorable hairpin containing the mapped read stack (e.g. as in miRanalyzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) or simultaneously, where the distribution of the reads in the putative hairpin and hairpin features are considered (as in miRDeep2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Variants of those approaches have also been proposed in the literature. NoraDesk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was the first method to incorporate structural energy based features and read coverage information to increase the detection accuracy of small ncRNAs, including miRNAs, whereas miReader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] relies only on hybridization patterns of the reads to detect miRNAs.</p><p>The hairpin analysis has been performed mostly through machine learning based predictive models. To obtain these models, a feature set (feature vector) describing sequence and/or structural aspects of pre-miRNAs sequences (+) and hairpin like (-) sequences is extracted to create a training data set, which is subsequently fed to a machine learning algorithm. An investigation on human pre-miRNAs classifiers indicated that the feature set, instead of the learning algorithm, had the major effect in the classification accuracy of the induced models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the relevance of those features for the correct classification of pre-miRNAs from other species remained an open question.</p><p>Since miRNA systems in plants and animals differ substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], computational tools for plant and animal miRNAs discovery have been developed separately (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). However, in practice, even instances of species from the same kingdom apparently diverge substantially regarding their intrinsic and extrinsic features. Therefore, in order to develop miRNA discovery tools robust to species-specific differences, a first step is to determine if a unique feature set can capture the diversity of pre-miRNAs throughout species. Moreover, it is important to establish boundaries of the applicability of cross-species miRNAs predictive models, since the relevance of any tool depends on its ability to detect the miRNAs present in the data set under analysis. Another important aspect is the computational cost of extracting a feature set, since this cost can be prohibitive for some distinct pre-miRNAs features (e.g. energy stability parameters) if they are to be computed for millions of hairpins. These issues were addressed in this study, considering eight feature sets investigated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], three learning algorithms and 45 species representing eight subphyla/classes.</p><p>Our experimental results showed that the classification complexity of pre-miRNAs is species-dependent, albeit some feature sets and learning algorithms were more likely to maximize the predictive accuracy of pre-miRNAs classifiers for most species (first subsection of the <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Results and discussions</xref> section). To interpret this dependency, we analyzed how relevant the features extracted from instances of one species are for the classification of instances of other species (in the following subsections). This analysis indicated that pre-miRNAs classifiers restricted to predict instances of species from the same subphylum of the species used on its induction (training species), instead of the same kingdom, are more likely to achieve higher accuracies. Nevertheless, our results also showed that ensembles of classifiers using computationally inexpensive feature sets performed well even if the subphylum of the training species disagrees. The ensemble approach has the potential to extend the applicability of pre-miRNA predictive models to a broader number of species, while keeping the computational cost close to that of single classifiers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The analysis carried out in this study was based on the accuracy of classifiers obtained in two steps: (1) create pre-miRNA data sets and (2) induce and test classifiers for classification of pre-miRNAs. In the step (1), for each species, 30 sequences from each class were randomly sampled from the pre-processed positive and negative sets to compose the test sets. From the remaining sequences, 60 sequences from each class were randomly sampled to construct the training set. Afterwards, all features were extracted from each sequence. This first step was repeated 10 times. As these data sets were built by species, they are also referred as training and test species. In the step (2), instances from all test sets were classified by the classifiers obtained with the training data built in the step (1). The accuracy of these classifiers were analyzed under the two-way analysis of variance (anova) Eqs. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> and <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>.</p><p>The sizes of the training and test sets were, respectively, 2/3 and 1/3 of the smallest number of positive non-redundant sequences, shown in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Once training and test sequence sets had been randomly sampled, all features were extracted. Therefore, the data sets of feature vectors diverged only by the feature composition, which can be geometrically seen as different subspaces of the unknown space of the pre-miRNAs features. By fixing the sizes of training and test sets, we reduced the sources of random variations, i.e., variations that cannot be assigned to a main factor. Moreover, since our main goal was to study the effect of the training species (<italic>S</italic>) in the predictive accuracy of pre-miRNAs classifiers, we considered the effects of the classification algorithm and the feature set in a unique factor, represented here by <italic>M</italic>. Therefore, considering three algorithms and eight feature sets, the number of levels of the factor <italic>M</italic> is 24 (or 3 &#215;8).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Anova 1: M &#215; S</title><p>The first analysis was performed to study the relationship between the factors <italic>M</italic> and <italic>S</italic> (<italic>M</italic>&#215;<italic>S</italic>) in order to identify the levels of <italic>M</italic> that led to higher predictive accuracies for each species. For such, we considered the Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>, where the accuracies were estimated considering the same training and test species.

Since the number of miRNA families is relatively small compared to the number of positive examples available, redundancy removal is an important pre-processing procedure to avoid overfitted predictive models. We used dnaclust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to remove redundant sequences, prior to the sampling of examples to compose training and test sets. With dnaclust, sequences in positive sets of each species were clustered such that the similarity between sequences within a cluster were at least 80 %. Afterwards, one sequence from each cluster was randomly sampled to construct the positive non-redundant sets. The same pre-processing procedure was applied to the sets of negative sequences.

The relatively lower number of redundant pseudo hairpins in those sets, compared to pre-miRNAs sequence sets, is due to the random choice of the starting position of the pseudo hairpin excision.

As the red frames indicate, these cases are more likely if the two species are from the same subphylum/class. However, there are many exceptions within and outside the subphylum/class umbrella. For example, with few exceptions (e.g. ame, bmo and bta), the features that are important for the correct classification of instances from the species bfl, cin, cbr, cel and aae, were also important for the correct classification of instances from other species.

As a consequence, the performance of these tools is usually reduced when data sets from species not used in their development are analyzed. Building species-specific miRNA discovery tools may not be always viable, for example for lack of training data. Since the detection of putative pre-miRNAs is an important step in the development of miRNA discovery tools, it is important to investigate how the peculiarities naturally occurring in pre-miRNAs between species relate to the learning bias of machine learning approaches. In this study, we presented the results of a systematic investigation on the automatic learning of pre-miRNAs of 45 species, using techniques traditionally employed by miRNA discovery tools from the literature. The results presented in this study not only showed the need to develop new approaches to handle the intrinsic characteristics of pre-miRNAs from different species, but we also indicated one potential way to go forward, using ensemble methods built with computationally efficient features.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12859_2016_1036_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>Phylum/division, subphylum/class, species, acronyms, number of positive examples available at miRBase 20, mean and standard deviation of the length distributions.
