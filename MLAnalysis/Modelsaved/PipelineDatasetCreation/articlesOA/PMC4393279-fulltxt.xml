Proteomic analysis, cDNA microarray, and high throughput <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization have previously been used to identify cilia-related proteins or genes from isolated cilia, MTECs, or <italic>Xenopus</italic> or zebrafish embryos [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. FoxJ1, the master transcription factor of motile cilia [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], is shown to drive the expression of several TTC genes, including <italic>IFT88</italic>, <italic>IFT140</italic>, <italic>IFT172</italic>, and <italic>TTC26</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], whereas TTC25 is found critical for multicilia formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic skin cells [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We performed cDNA microarray using DAPT-treated MTECs and found that, in addition to ten known cilia-related TTC genes, ten novel TTC genes also exhibited correlated expression patterns during multiciliogenesis (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Consistently, all the ten novel TTC genes, except <italic>TTC5 and TTC39c</italic>, have been found to be upregulated by at least two-fold in the previous cDNA microarray using FoxJ1-positive MTECs [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We characterized these ten novel genes using zebrafish embryos and found that <italic>ttc4</italic>, <italic>-9c</italic>, <italic>-36</italic>, and <italic>-39c</italic> are critical for motile cilia functions. The remaining six, <italic>ttc5</italic>, <italic>-12</italic>, -<italic>16</italic>, <italic>-18</italic>, <italic>-29</italic>, and <italic>-39a</italic>, were precluded from our further studies because their zebrafish morphants did not show striking body curvatures (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Nevertheless, since we did not check the knockdown efficiency of the MOs, whether these genes are indeed unrelated to cilia still needs further clarification.</p><p>Our results indicate that, TTC4, -9c, -36, -39c, and -25 are critical for normal body shape, otolith formation, pronephric cilia function, and left-right asymmetry during zebrafish embryonic development (Figs <xref rid="pone.0124378.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). They are also required for proper fluid flow of the brain ventricles (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Kidney cysts are mainly attributed to overproliferation [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In zebrafish, defects in motile cilia can cause pronephric cysts but detailed mechanisms are still poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although the <italic>ttc</italic> morphants frequently exhibited enlarged pronephric ducts (S2-S6 Videa vs. <xref rid="pone.0124378.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>), only some morphants of <italic>ttc4</italic> and <italic>ttc25</italic> contained visible pronephric cysts (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Nonetheless, there might exist tiny cysts that were not visible in our examinations. Detailed studies in the future are still required to clarify whether or not <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic> are involved in pronephric cyst formation.</p><p>Although all these TTC proteins are important for KV cilia formation (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A&#8211;4C</xref>), they have different impact on the motility of pronephric cilia (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124378.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0124378.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Videos</xref>). Compared to the control morphants, pronephric cilia motilities were strikingly repressed in the morphants of <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic>. The average CBF was reduced by more than 81% (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). By contrast, in the morphants of <italic>ttc25</italic> and <italic>ttc4</italic>, the reduction in average CBF was less than 40% (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). This suggests that <italic>ttc9c</italic>, <italic>ttc36</italic>, and <italic>ttc39c</italic> may have a role in the assembly or activity of axonemal dynein arms.</p><p>It is both surprising and interesting to find that all the cilia-related TTC proteins are implicated in IFT. Nine TTC proteins, including TTC26, have previously been shown as components of IFT-A or-B complex or BBSome [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). TTC25 is important for ciliogenesis and hedgehog signaling in <italic>Xenopus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We further showed that mammalian TTC25 is strongly associated with both IFT-A and&#8212;B complexes but not BBSome (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Therefore, TTC25 might function in bridging IFT-A and IFT-B during IFT. TTC36 appeared to associate more strongly with IFT-A complex than with IFT-B complex, whereas TTC39c, -4, and -9c associated with certain subcomplex or subunits of IFT-A or BBSome (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Since TTC26/DYF13 is involved in the transport of motility-related proteins into cilia/flagella through association with IFT-B [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the association of TTC36 with IFT-A might also function in transport of certain cilia components. TTC36 (also named HBP21) and TTC4 have been proposed as co-chaperons implicated in tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0124378.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and might help protein folding as well. The punctate staining patterns of these TTC proteins (<xref rid="pone.0124378.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) are also consistent with their potential roles in IFT. Nevertheless, how these novel cilia-related TTC proteins function at the molecular level still needs future investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124378.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Dose-dependent effects of the <italic>ttc</italic> MOs.</title><p>One-cell-stage zebrafish embryos were injected with the indicated dose of the MOs.
