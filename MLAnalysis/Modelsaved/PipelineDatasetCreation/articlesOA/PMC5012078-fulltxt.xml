Two novel pigmentation phenotypes, egg-spots and blotches, emerged during the rapid diversification of East African cichlid fishes. Egg-spots are circular pigmentation markings on the anal fins of hundreds of derived haplochromine cichlids species, whereas blotches are patches of conspicuous anal fin pigmentation with ill-defined boundaries that occur in few species that belong to basal cichlid lineages. Both traits play an important role in the breeding behavior of this group of fishes. Knowledge about the origin, homology and underlying genetics of these pigmentation traits is sparse.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic and differential gene expression analysis of egg-spots and blotches. We first conducted an RNA sequencing experiment where we compared egg-spot tissue with the remaining portion of egg-spot-free fin tissue using six individuals of <italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>. We identified 1229 differentially expressed genes between the two tissue types. We then showed that rates of evolution of these genes are higher than average estimated on whole transcriptome data. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that 29 out of a subset of 46 differentially expressed genes showed an analogous expression pattern in another haplochromine species&#8217; egg-spots, <italic>Cynotilapia pulpican</italic>, strongly suggesting that these genes are involved in the egg-spot phenotype. Among these are the previously identified egg-spot gene <italic>fhl2a</italic>, two known patterning genes (<italic>hoxC12a</italic> and <italic>bmp3</italic>) as well as other pigmentation related genes such as <italic>asip</italic>. Finally, we analyzed the expression patterns of the same gene subset in two species that feature blotches instead of egg-spots, one haplochromine species (<italic>Pseudocrenilabrus philander</italic>) and one ectodine species (<italic>Callochromis macrops</italic>), revealing that the expression patterns in blotches and egg-spots are rather distinct.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified several candidate genes that will serve as an important and useful resource for future research on the emergence and diversification of cichlid fishes&#8217; egg-spots. Only a limited degree of conservation of gene expression patterns was detected between the egg-spots of the derived haplochromines and blotches from ancestral haplochromines, as well as between the two types of blotches, suggesting an independent origin of these traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-3046-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pigmentation</kwd><kwd>Diversity</kwd><kwd>Egg-spot</kwd><kwd>Blotches</kwd><kwd>East African cichlids</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Funda&#231;&#227;o para a Ci&#234;ncia e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/43421/2008</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INTERGENADAPT</award-id><award-id>CICHLID~X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salzburger</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Animal pigmentation patterns are highly variable phenotypes both at the intra- and inter-specific level, and represent prominent traits to study the genetics of species diversification and adaptation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). The functionality of color patterns can readily be assessed in most cases, given that these traits often evolve in response to adaptation to the environment via natural selection (e.g. inter- and intra-specific communication, camouflage and mimicry), or co-vary with female choice via sexual selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The outcome of these two types of selection regimes can be different, with the former often producing cryptic phenotypes, where coloration mimics the environment, while the latter generates conspicuous phenotypes, where males typically display bright colors driving female choice or male-male competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the high evolutionary significance of color patterns, the genetic mechanisms underlying their formation and diversification often remain elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent work in fish model systems, especially in zebrafish, has started to uncover the genes and cellular processes involved in pigmentation pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pigmentation patterns are determined by the specification of different types of neural crest derived pigment cells &#8211; the chromatophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] &#8211; that contain different light absorbing pigments: melanophores contain black eumelanin pigments; erythrophores and xantophores contain yellow-red carotenoid and pteridine pigments; cyanophores contain a blue pigment of unknown composition; and finally, iridophores contain purine crystals that produce metallic iridescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Differences in the arrangement, position, and density of these cells leads to the diversity of color patterns present in nature. These differences depend on a variety of factors including neural crest cell migration, specification, proliferation, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we address the molecular basis of two novel and conspicuous pigmentation traits found in the anal fin of male cichlid fishes &#8211; egg-spots and blotches (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Egg-spots represent an evolutionary novelty that emerged only once in the haplochromine lineage, the most species-rich group of East African cichlids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These circular markings consist of a central circular area containing xanthophores and iridophores, surrounded by an outer transparent ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They are primarily found in males and show an extreme inter- and intra-specific variability in number, color, and position on the fin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Egg-spots have been the subject of intense studies suggesting a signaling function in the peculiar mating behavior of the mouth-brooding haplochromines. They are likely sexually selected via female choice in some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and via male-male competition in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Blotches, on the other hand, are patches of conspicuous anal fin pigmentation with ill-defined boundaries and occur only in a handful of cichlid species, including some basal haplochromines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and ectodine cichlids from Lake Tanganyika (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As with egg-spots, they are mostly found in males and their function might also be linked to courtship behavior, although this has been less extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The origin and evolutionary trajectory of these anal fin patterns remains unclear. Due to the phylogenetic position of the species showing blotches as sister-group to the egg-spot bearing haplochromines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], it might be speculated that egg-spots are derived from the blotch-pattern, which would make the two phenotypes homologous.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Representative males from the four species analyzed: two haplochromine species displaying egg-spots in their anal fins (<italic>A. burtoni</italic> and <italic>C. pulpican</italic>), a basal haplochromine species (<italic>P. philander</italic>) and an ectodine species (<italic>C. macrops</italic>), both showing orange blotches in their anal fin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_3046_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Convergent evolution is widespread in East African cichlid adaptive radiations, not only between lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but also within a single lake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, haplochromine anal fin blotches are phenotypically similar to the ones found in the genus <italic>Callochromis</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the phylogenetic position of <italic>Callochromis</italic>, which is nested within the Ectodini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], suggests that these two types of blotches evolved independently. Overall, we envision two possible scenarios for the origin of egg-spots: in one case they represent a derived state of blotches found in haplochromines, whereas blotches found in ectodines evolved independently (two origins); alternatively egg-spots have evolved independently from the blotches of both basal haplochromines and ectodines (three origins).</p><p>Understanding the genetic pathways underlying these pigmentation phenotypes can help us to distinguish between these scenarios. While several studies have addressed pigmentation diversity in East African cichlids, little is known about the genetics underlying their coloration and pigmentation patterning, and only a handful of genes have been studied in detail. Among these genes is <italic>hagoromo</italic>, which shows a greater diversity of alternatively spliced variants and accelerated protein evolution in the haplochromines compared to other cichlids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; <italic>paired box 7</italic> (pax7), on the other hand, was shown to be linked to a haplochromine female biased pigmentation phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Three genes have so far been associated with the egg-spot phenotype: the xanthophore marker colony stimulating factor 1 receptor A (<italic>csf1ra</italic>), and the two <italic>four and a half lim domain 2</italic> proteins (<italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic>). <italic>csf1ra</italic> is expressed in haplochromine egg-spots and in the characteristic &#8220;Perlfleckmuster&#8221; (pearly spotted) pattern present in cichlid fins. This gene underwent adaptive sequence evolution in the ancestral lineage of the haplochromines coinciding with the emergence of egg-spots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, <italic>csf1ra</italic> is downstream in the pathway of egg-spot morphogenesis. More recently, we have shown that <italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b</italic> are more causally related to egg-spot development and that an alteration in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of <italic>fhl2b</italic> could have contributed to the emergence of this trait in haplochromines in the first place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first addressed the question of the genetic basis of the egg-spots. We then went onto use comparative transcriptomics across species carrying egg-spots and blotches to shed light on the origin of this novel trait. Specifically, we identified a total of 1229 genes that were differentially expressed (DE) between egg-spot and non-egg-spot fin tissues in the haplochromine cichlid <italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>. These genes are evolving at a higher rate than average making this a valuable dataset to study the emergence and rapid diversification of this trait. For a subset of 46 DE genes we measured expression levels in three other species: the egg-spot bearing haplochromine <italic>Cynotilapia pulpican</italic>, carrying egg-spots on a different region of the anal fin than <italic>A. burtoni</italic>, and two blotch-bearing species, the basal haplochromine <italic>Pseudocrenilabrus philander</italic> and the ectodine <italic>Callochromis macrops</italic>. The rationale is that if egg-spots and blotches in haplochromines are controlled by the same genetic components they might show similar expression profiles.</p><p>A total of 29 out of 46 genes were found to be DE in <italic>C. pulpican</italic>. By comparing the expression in two haplochromine species with different egg-spot arrangements, we confirmed that the expression of the genes is correlated with the presence of egg-spots (irrespective of their position on the anal fin), whilst excluding potential positional genes and therefore confirming their involvement in egg-spots formation. Both types of blotches showed very distinct expression profiles from the egg-spots, and substantial differences in gene expression were also found between the two types of blotches. A similar gene expression profile between the egg-spots of derived haplochromines and the blotch pattern in the basal haplochromine <italic>P. philander</italic> would be indicative of a common origin for both traits, whereas similar expression profiles between the haplochromine egg-spots and the blotch of <italic>C. macrops</italic> would suggest that convergent evolution of this trait involved the same genetic pathways. Our study reveals the opposite for the genes under investigation, i.e. egg-spots and blotches show different expression profiles and also the two types of blotches differ in gene expression profiles, suggesting that egg-spots and blotches do not share a genetic basis and that convergent phenotypic evolution does not correspond to parallelism at the genetic level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcript profile in anal fin and egg-spot tissue</title><p>In order to identify genes involved in egg-spot morphogenesis we quantified differences in gene expression patterns between egg-spots and the surrounding non-pigmented anal fin of six <italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic> males (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Illumina RNAseq (RNA sequencing) provided a total of 193,054,988 high quality reads from the six egg-spot tissue samples and 194,099,061 reads from anal fin tissue samples of the same individuals. The replicates for each tissue were sequenced separately and the average number of reads per sample was 3,226,2837.42 (2,750,960.2&#8211;3,226,2837.42). We mapped the reads from each replicate to a reference <italic>A. burtoni</italic> embryonic library, which is a transcript collection from several different embryonic and larval developmental stages, and therefore probably the most comprehensive available representation of the entire gene set from <italic>A. burtoni</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In total we identified 1229 genes that were DE between the two types of tissues, with 620 genes being over-expressed in the egg-spot tissue, whilst 609 were under-expressed (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

From the 720 contigs with a BLAST hit we could functionally annotate 495 using BLAST2GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We further described the Gene Ontology (GO) term composition for egg-spot over-expression and egg-spot under-expression in comparison to the reference transcriptome GO representation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Overall, the GO terms representation was similar between the two tissues. However, there were several GO terms for &#8220;Molecular function&#8221; and &#8220;Cellular component&#8221; that differed significantly between the two data-sets, suggesting, as expected, that the two tissues are functionally different (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Gene ontology (GO) ID representations: (Biological process, Molecular function and Cellular component) for both over-expressed and under-expressed genes in the egg-spot tissue.

Five categories were significantly enriched in our over-expression gene dataset: &#8216;Pigmentation&#8217; (GO:0043473), &#8216;Developmental pigmentation&#8217; (GO:0048066), &#8216;G-protein coupled peptide receptor activity&#8217; (GO:0008528), &#8216;Peptide receptor activity&#8217; (GO:0001653) and &#8216;Cell adhesion molecule binding&#8217; (GO:0050839) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These are GO functional categories known to play a role in the development of pigmentation patterns. Neural crest cells are precursors of pigment cells and migrate from their original location to the anal fin where they will form the egg-spots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], therefore genes playing a role in cell migration, cell adhesion and pigmentation development are relevant to the formation of this trait. Egg-spot formation relies on pigment production, which in turn is often activated via membrane receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> we present the list of genes belonging to these enriched functional categories that are potentially good candidates for egg-spot morphogenesis. The genes belonging to the GO term &#8216;Developmental pigmentation&#8217; were overlapping with the ones included in the &#8216;Pigmentation&#8217; category and the same is true for the two receptor GO term categories, therefore we only show three of the five enriched functional GO categories. This method of functional description of a gene dataset to extract candidates represents a supervised search, meaning that we might bias our findings towards what is already known. We note, however, that there are many other non-described genes, or known genes with incomplete GO term annotations, which could play a role in egg-spot morphogenesis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Enrichment of functional GO terms in the egg-spot over-expressed genes (yellow bar) when compared to the total transcriptome of <italic>A. burtoni</italic> (blue bar).

Around 41&#160;% of our candidate contigs did not have a BLAST hit against the <italic>D. rerio</italic> protein database.

These genes are most likely involved in fin rather than egg-spot patterning, as suggested by the fact that three of these of genes are known to participate in fin development (<italic>retinol binding protein 7</italic> (<italic>rbp7</italic>), <italic>retinol binding protein 4</italic> (<italic>rbp4</italic>) and <italic>insulin</italic>-<italic>like growth factor 1</italic> (<italic>igf1</italic>)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Overall, we confirmed the over-expression of 14 genes in the adult egg-spots from both <italic>A. burtoni</italic> and <italic>C. pulpican</italic> making them strong candidates genes for egg-spot formation that deserve further investigation.</p><p>Among the 23 under-expressed genes in <italic>A. burtoni</italic>, 15 were also consistently under-expressed in the egg-spots of <italic>C. pulpican</italic> (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), including one unidentified contig.

The remaining eight genes showed no differences in gene expression between egg-spot and anal fin tissue on <italic>C. pulpican</italic>, and could therefore be involved in fin patterning. Thus far, none of these eight genes have been related to a function in pigmentation.</p><p>We cannot rule out that the genes that did not show the same pattern in both species do not have a function in egg-spots. Although egg-spots in <italic>A. burtoni</italic> and <italic>C. pulpican</italic> are homologous they do not necessarily have to share the exact same genetic network. It is thus possible that the DE genes might be responsible for interspecific differences of the egg-spot phenotype acting in a lineage-specific manner as has been shown in other taxa. For instance, the eyespots (concentric wing pigmentation patterns) of nymphalid butterflies, which are arranged along the distal half of the wing, are considered homologous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is a great flexibility in the expression patterns of four genes involved in the development of these structures in the different species studied: <italic>antennapedia</italic> was the only gene where there was a gain of expression associated with the origin of the eyespot phenotype, whereas there were many gain or loss events for <italic>notch</italic>, <italic>distalless</italic> and <italic>spalt</italic> in the different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Overall, the genetic network underlying the nymphalid eyespot pattern appears to be highly variable, suggesting that homologous structures are not necessarily controlled by the same set of genes. Perhaps the same is true for cichlid egg-spots, which might initially have been under the control of the same set of genes followed by diversification in the recruitment of different genes. A broader phylogenetic sampling of egg-spot phenotypes would be necessary to clarify this question.</p><p>The 29 genes that were consistently over- or under-expressed in the adult egg-spots in both haplochromine species are nevertheless strong candidates genes for egg-spot development and merit further investigation to understand their role in the origin and diversification of this trait. These genes should be studied in detail throughout development and their function should be tested, not only in one species but also across several species of egg-spot bearing haplochromines with variable egg-spot phenotypes. With this approach we will be able to distinguish between a functional role in the evolution of the trait and or merely a function in the development and/or physiology of the trait.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Comparative gene expression between egg-spots and haplochromine blotches</title><p>We then measured gene expression of our set of 46 candidate genes in a basal haplochromine species, <italic>Pseudocrenilabrus philander</italic>, which displays a blotch rather than an egg-spot on its anal fin (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

BLASTx searches were done against the <italic>Danio rerio</italic> protein database using a threshold of <italic>e</italic><sup>&#8722;<italic>5</italic></sup> and maximum number of hits of 20. These GO terms were used to estimate transcript function. A table with the list of the differential expressed transcripts, their respective values of expression, and their GO terms is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

The enrichment of functional GO terms in the egg-spot over-expressed gene dataset was calculated with a two-sided Fisher&#8217;s exact test with a FDR of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Rates of evolution for the differential expressed transcripts</title><p>Transcriptome data from the five available cichlid species (<italic>Pundamila nyererei</italic>, <italic>Neolamprologus brichardi</italic>, <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>, <italic>Maylandia zebra</italic>, and <italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>) were downloaded from Broad Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Each species&#8217; transcriptome consisted of multiple libraries that were concatenated. The 1229 DE genes from <italic>A. burtoni</italic> were compared using a BLASTn search (threshold: <italic>e</italic><sup>&#8722;<italic>50</italic></sup>) against each species&#8217; transcriptome and DE genes with a hit in all cichlid species were retained (599). The 599 DE genes were then compared using BLASTx (threshold: <italic>e</italic><sup>&#8722;<italic>20</italic></sup>) against the tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>) proteome from the ENSEMBL database and corresponding coding sequences (cds) retrieved (378). Finally, the database of 378 tilapia cds was queried against the individual cichlid transcriptomes using BLASTn (threshold: <italic>e</italic><sup>&#8722;<italic>35</italic></sup>). BLAST outputs were parsed and filtered to retain hits with identity &gt;90&#160;%, length &gt;200&#160;bp and bit score &gt;200. We obtained 298 tilapia cds that have at least a hit on all cichlid transcriptomes. A concatenated fasta file was built to include the ten top hits from each cichlid transcriptome and the 298 tilapia cds. Sequences were then aligned using MAFFT v7.245 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] with einsi &#8211;adjustdirection options (einsi is suitable for sequences containing large unalignable regions, as expected with the presence of UTRs (untranslated regions) and splicing variants in our transcriptome data). Alignments were trimmed using the tilapia cds as a reference and visually inspected. Alignments with paralogous sequences resulting from recent duplications were discarded. Within each individual alignment a consensus was built across transcripts from each cichlid species with &#8216;cons&#8217; from EMBOSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] (&#8722;plurality 1.5, indicating the cut-off for the number of positive matches below which there is no consensus). Alignments were then translated to proteins and checked for all sequences being in the corresponding tilapia reading frame (no stop codons). The whole pipeline was run with customized R and Unix scripts. We obtained 196 good alignments, 74&#160;% of which comprised of all five cichlid species sequences, while the remaining included at least three species each. Average alignment length was 1716&#160;bp, ranging from 270 to 7794&#160;bp. Alignments are available from the author upon request. dN/dS estimates were calculated using the script kaks.pl in Bioperl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] which computes the dN/dS for all sequence pairs, using the Nei-Gojobori method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Gene expression analysis using qPCR</title><p>The expression of 46 genes (23 over-expressed genes in the egg-spot region and 23 under-expressed genes in the egg-spot) was further studied in three other species - <italic>Cynotilapia pulpican</italic>, <italic>Pseudocrenilabrus philander</italic> and <italic>Callochromis macrops</italic>.

In this experiment 4 to 7 individuals were used. For all experiments each individual was an independent replicate meaning that there was no pooling of samples.</p><p>The reactions were run on the StepOnePlus&#8482; Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master mix (Roche, Switzerland), following the manufacturer&#8217;s protocols. All reactions were performed with an annealing temperature of 58&#160;&#176;C, a final concentration of cDNA of 1&#160;ng/&#956;l and a final primer concentration of 200&#160;ng/&#956;l. The comparative threshold cycle (CT) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] was used to calculate the relative concentrations between tissues, where anal fin was taken as the reference tissue and Ribosomal protein L7 (<italic>rpl7</italic>) or the Ribosomal protein SA3 (<italic>rpsa3</italic>) genes as endogenous controls. Primer efficiencies were calculated using standard curves. Efficiency values of test primers were comparable to the efficiency of endogenous control primers (<italic>rpl7</italic>, <italic>rspa3</italic>) and are available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p><p>Significant differential gene expression between egg-spot/blotch and anal fin was tested with a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. When the data did not conform to the assumptions of a <italic>t</italic>-test (normal distribution and equal variances), an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch&#8217;s correction or a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. Normality of the data was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test and an <italic>F</italic>-test was used to determine if the variances of the datasets were equal. When the sample size was lower than five a Mann&#8211;Whitney test was used. Statistics were carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5.0a for Mac OS X (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).
