As an Adjuvant System, age de-escalation and schedule selection step, this study assessed 3 schedules of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> and RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> in infants and young children 5&#x02013;17 months of age in Ghana.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>A Phase II, partially-blind randomized controlled study (blind to vaccine, not to schedule), of 19 months duration was conducted in two (2) centres in Ghana between August 2006 and May 2008. Subjects were allocated randomly (1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1) to one of six study groups at each study site, each defining which vaccine should be given and by which schedule (0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-months). For the 0,1,2-month schedule participants received RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or rabies vaccine at one center and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> at the other. For the other schedules at both study sites, they received RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of serious adverse events until 10 months post dose 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The number of serious adverse events reported across groups was balanced. One child had a simple febrile convulsion, which evolved favourably without sequelae, considered to be related to RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> vaccination. Low grade reactions occurred slightly more frequently in recipients of RTS,S/AS than rabies vaccines; grade 3 reactions were infrequent. Less local reactogenicity occurred with RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> than RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>. Both candidate vaccines were highly immunogenic for anti-circumsporozoite and anti-Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen antibodies. Recipients of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> compared to RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> had higher peak anti-circumsporozoite antibody responses for all 3 schedules. Three dose schedules were more immunogenic than 2 dose schedules. Area under the curve analyses for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies were comparable between the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> schedules.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both candidate malaria vaccines were well tolerated. Anti-circumsporozoite responses were greater with RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> than RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> and when 3 rather than 2 doses were given. This study supports the selection of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> and a 3 dose schedule for further development in children and infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:\\clinicaltrials.gov\ct2\show\NCT00360230">NCT00360230</ext-link>

<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria is a major cause of human suffering and represents an important economic burden to sub-Saharan African countries <xref rid="pone.0007302-Breman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Sachs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A safe and effective vaccine that prevents <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria would be an important addition to current control methods.</p><p>The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium), is formulated with proprietary Adjuvant Systems which enhance the ability of the vaccine to induce a strong immune response. The AS02 Adjuvant System contains an oil-in-water emulsion with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS21, a natural saponin molecule purified from the bark of the South American tree <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic>. The AS01 Adjuvant System is based on liposomes and contains the same amounts of MPL and QS21 as AS02. Both preclinical studies and field studies in adults have suggested that the AS01 formulation is more immunogenic than the AS02 formulation <xref rid="pone.0007302-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0007302-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>AS01 and AS02 were initially developed as the adult formulations AS02<sub>A</sub> and AS01<sub>B</sub> (0.5 mL dose). For compatibility with standard auto-disable Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) syringes, a 0.5 mL variant of the paediatric 0.25 mL dose of RTS,S/AS02<sub>A</sub> (RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>) and of RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> (RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub>) were developed.</p><p>A large study with the paediatric dose (0.25 mL) of the adult formulation RTS,S/AS02<sub>A</sub>, conducted in Mozambican children aged 1&#x02013;4 years, demonstrated the vaccine to have an acceptable safety profile and to be efficacious against clinical malaria (vaccine efficacy of 35&#x00025;) and severe malaria disease (vaccine efficacy of 49&#x00025;) over a period of 18 months <xref rid="pone.0007302-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Subsequently, non-inferiority of the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> formulation compared to a paediatric dose of RTS,S/AS02<sub>A</sub> was demonstrated with respect to anti-circumsporozoite (CS) and anti-Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen (HBs) antibodies in children aged 3 to 5 years from Mozambique <xref rid="pone.0007302-Macete1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Both vaccines were shown to have a similar safety profile. More recently, a similar safety profile of RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> was demonstrated in children aged 18 months to 4 years in Gabon <xref rid="pone.0007302-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; a trend towards better anti-CS and anti-HBs responses with RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> was observed. Following administration of RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to infants in Tanzania, RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> had a promising safety profile, met pre-specified non-inferiority seroconversion rates for co-administered EPI antigens, and reduced the incidence of malaria infection (vaccine efficacy 65&#x00025; over 6 months) <xref rid="pone.0007302-Abdulla1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In children aged 5 to 17 months in Kenya and Tanzania, proof-of-concept of the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> candidate vaccine was recently demonstrated in a trial in which vaccine efficacy against malaria disease was 53&#x00025;, over an average follow up period of 8 months <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The trial reported here is one of several age de-escalation, Adjuvant System and schedule selection steps undertaken prior to the conduct of a phase 3 RTS,S trial. The schedules under investigation were selected on the basis that they can be integrated into the existing EPI vaccination programme. Two or three vaccine doses one month apart (0,1- and 0,1,2-month schedule) could be administered together with two or three doses of DTP respectively, while a third delayed dose could be administered together with measles and yellow fever vaccines at 9 months of age (0,1,7-month schedule).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>: NCT00360230] and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007302.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007302.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The trial was conducted at two study centres in Ghana: a collaboration between the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research (KCCR), Kumasi and the School of Medical Sciences (SMS), Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi hosted at the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital and the Kintampo Health Research Centre (KHRC), Ghana Health Service, Ministry of Health, Kintampo.</p><p>The two centers are about 200 km away from each other. The recruitment area for the KCCR/SMS center was the Agogo town, while a more rural population was recruited at KHRC. Literacy rates are similar in both populations. The main activity is farming. The main population groups around KHRC comprise people from the Bono and Mo tribes and there is a large population from northern Ghana that have permanently migrated into Kintampo District. The majority of the population around KCCR/SMS is Akan with a small group of migrants from the north of the country. The study occurred at the same time in the two sites. Although data for health indicators such as HIV prevalence and malaria transmission were not collected as part of the study, the climate and basic health indicators are fairly similar with HIV rates under 4&#x00025; in both areas. Malaria transmission intensity is intense, perennial (269 infectious bites/person/year and a prevalence of malaria parasitaemia among children less than 5 years of about 50&#x00025; throughout the whole year in Kintampo in 2004) (Owusu-Agyei S., personal communication). Impregnated bednets were distributed at screening to potential study participants, regardless of whether children were then enrolled in the trial.</p><p>The protocol was approved by the Food and Drugs Board, Ghana; the Ghana Health Service Ethical Review Committee, Accra, Ghana; the KHRC Institutional Ethics Committee, the KHRC Scientific Review Committee; the Committee on Human Research Protection and Ethics, SMS, KNUST, Kumasi, Ghana; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) ethics committee, London, UK and the Western Institutional Review Board, Washington, USA. The trial was undertaken according to the International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was monitored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. The study was overseen by a formally constituted Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) operating under a charter. The DSMB reviewed safety data from a RTS,S/AS trial in older children <xref rid="pone.0007302-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> prior to authorising the start of this study, and from a subset of children post dose 1 and post dose 2, prior to progression to the next vaccination dose within this trial. A Local Safety Monitor was designated at each site whose overall role was to support the clinical investigator and to act as a link between the investigator and the DSMB.</p><p>At the KCCR/SMS a register of potentially eligible subjects was made from children attending the immunisation clinics in the town of Agogo. KHRC has a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) in place that registers births, deaths and migrations to and from the area. The KHDSS was used to compile a list of potentially eligible children from an electronic database held at KHRC. In both study sites information was distributed to parents/legally accepted representatives of potential participants through meetings organized in the community, followed by several steps of family and individual based information sessions, with supporting information material. Reinforcement and checking of understanding was done with the support of pre-established documents addressing frequently asked questions. The whole process happened in the potential participant's own language, in the presence of an impartial literate member of the potential participant's community if parents/legally accepted representatives could not read or write.</p><p>To qualify for enrolment children had to be free of obvious health problems as established by medical history, clinical examination and laboratory blood markers for safety at screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedures and interventions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007302-t001">Table 1</xref>)</title><p>Access of the study population to general clinical care according to national recommendations was facilitated, in collaboration with the government services. Hospital services were open for care on a continuous basis. Access to care was facilitated through the reimbursement of transport to the hospital and direct or phone access to field based study staff for the organisation of transport if needed. Malaria episodes were treated as recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ghana with oral artesunate and amodiaquine and IV or IM quinine if hospital admission was needed.</p><p>Both in Kintampo and Agogo, study vaccination sessions were organised in specially dedicated rooms with separated space for vaccine preparation and administration, located in the vicinity of standard EPI clinics, the hospital and research center. Recipients of candidate vaccine were administered lyophilised RTS,S reconstituted with 0.5 mL of either AS02<sub>D</sub> or AS01<sub>E</sub> Adjuvant Systems. Both candidate and control vaccines were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the left arm on a 0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-month schedule. In KHRC, children on the 0,1,2-month schedule received rabies vaccine as a control (Rabipur&#x000ae;; Chiron Behring GmbH). In the KCCR/SMS, children on the 0,1,2-month schedule, received the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> experimental vaccine as an active comparator. Randomisation to each of the other study groups was balanced between the two study sites. Vaccinees were observed for 60 minutes following each vaccination.</p><p>Volunteers were followed daily for the solicited adverse events (AEs) of pain, swelling, fever (defined as an axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C), drowsiness, loss of appetite and irritability/fussiness for a total of 7 days following each vaccination. Unsolicited non-serious AEs were collected for 30 days following each dose. Serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study period. Blood draws for safety evaluation and measurement of humoral responses were taken at scheduled time points during the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007302-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007302-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007302.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Outline of study design.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007302-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0007302.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month -1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Days 0&#x0002b;6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Month 19</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="16" align="left" rowspan="1">

A SAE was defined per protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that was fatal, life-threatening, required hospitalisation, led to disability or incapacity, or was judged by investigator's as being medically important enough to be reported as serious. In order to maximize data capture about seizures, all seizures occurring within 30 days of vaccination had to be reported as SAEs. Data on seizures occurring within 7 days post vaccination were collected in a standard way according to Brighton collaboration guidelines <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bonhoeffer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Secondary safety endpoints included the occurrence of unsolicited AEs after each vaccination over a 30 day follow-up period, solicited local (pain, swelling) and general (measured fever, irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, loss of appetite) reactions over a 7 day period (day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) following each vaccination. Grade 3 general reactions were defined as: fever, an axillary temperature &#x02265;39.0&#x000b0;C; irritability/fussiness, crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity; drowsiness that prevented normal activity; loss of appetite, not eating at all. Grade 3 solicited local injection site reactions were defined as: pain, cried when limb moved/spontaneously painful; swelling, exceeding 20 mm in diameter. Safety laboratory blood assessments for haematological (haemoglobin, white blood cells [WBC], platelets), renal (creatinine), and hepatic (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) parameters were conducted at specific time points during the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007302-t001">Table 1</xref>). Tertiary endpoints included an assessment of SAEs up to 19 months post Dose 1.</p><p>For each AE/SAE, investigators had to assess whether (yes or no) there was a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the investigational product, using clinical judgment and taking into account the natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product and available information on experimental or marketed products. All solicited injection site reactions were considered causally related to vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Endpoints: immunogenicity</title><p>Anti-CS and anti-HBs antibodies were assessed prior to vaccination and on several occasions until 19 months post dose 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007302-t001">Table 1</xref>). Antibody levels against the CS protein tandem repeat epitope were measured by a standard, validated ELISA using theR32LR antigen that contains the sequence [NVDP(NANP)<sub>15</sub>]<sub>2</sub>LR <xref rid="pone.0007302-Macete1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Antibody responses against the HBs were quantified by a GSK validated sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 96-well microplates were coated with native HBs and after washing and blocking steps, dilutions of serum samples, controls and standard were added to the plate. After washing, a recombinant horseradish peroxidase conjugated HBs was added as secondary reagent. After a final washing step and a colorimetric reaction with 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032; tetramethylbenzidine stopped by addition of sulphuric acid, the plates were read in an ELISA reader. Titres were calculated using the reference standard curve with a 4 parameter logistic fitting algorithm and expressed in mIU/mL. The cut-off was set at 3.3 mIU/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size</title><p>For any comparison between two study groups, the study had 80 percent power to detect an approximately 3 fold increase of events, for an event occurring at a frequency of ten percent in the comparator group, by Fisher exact test (alpha 5&#x00025;).</p><p>For the secondary immunogenicity endpoints, anti-CS titres, a sample size of 75 evaluable subjects per group would have 90&#x00025; power to demonstrate equivalence of the two vaccine regimens under comparison (i.e. <italic>x</italic> versus <italic>y</italic>, 95&#x00025; CI of the GMT ratio <italic>x</italic>/<italic>y</italic> is within the range 0.33 to 3.0) at any time point assuming a log standard deviation of 0.9 in both groups, alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Subjects were allocated sequentially to treatment numbers in the order that they presented for vaccination. Treatment numbers were assigned to vaccines with a randomisation list generated using a standard SAS&#x000ae; (Statistical Analysis System) programme. Subjects were allocated randomly (1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1) to one of six study groups at each study site, each defining which vaccine should be given and by which schedule (0,1-, 0,1,2- or 0,1,7-months). For the 0,1,2-month schedule this meant RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or rabies vaccine at KHRC and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> at KCCR/SMS. For the other schedules at both study sites, this meant either RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>.</p><p>During the primary phase of the study, i.e. up to month 10, the study was partially blinded, whereby investigators involved in endpoint evaluation and parents/guardians were blinded to the vaccine administered, but not to the schedule. The vaccine administration occurred in a separate room in the presence of a vaccination team that was not involved in any other part in the study, as described in detailed standard procedures. From months 10 to 19, during the extended follow-up period, the study was single-blind as parents/guardians remained blind to the study vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analysis was carried out according to a DSMB approved report and analysis plan established before unblinding of trial data.</p><sec id="s2h1"><title>Safety</title><p>The proportion of subjects with a SAE, classified by the MedDRA preferred term level, reported from study start until study conclusion was tabulated with exact 95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI).

[6.1&#x02013;26.8] and 15.6&#x00025; [6.5&#x02013;29.5] in the Rabies (0,1,2-month) group reported at least one SAE from day of first vaccination to Month 10 (primary endpoint) and Month 19, respectively. No apparent imbalance between study groups in the occurrence of SAEs was observed, which was also true for the entire study duration, to Month 19 (not shown).</p><p>Four subjects died during the trial; one child from the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> 0,1,7-month schedule group died at home 7 days after having received the second experimental vaccine dose. A diagnosis of bronchopneumonia was made by verbal autopsy. One child from the rabies vaccine group died in hospital from severe malaria with severe anaemia and sepsis 7 months after the last vaccine dose. One child from the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> 0,1-month schedule group died in hospital of cerebral malaria 17 months after the last vaccine dose. Another child died in hospital of severe malaria, severe anaemia and convulsions, 18 months after enrolment. He was due to receive RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> (0,1,7-month schedule) but the first vaccination attempt failed, there was spillage of the attributed vaccine dose, and he received only a negligible amount of vaccine. After this failed attempt, he was not further vaccinated. None of the fatal SAEs were considered to be related to vaccination.</p><p>One SAE was considered to be related to vaccination: an 18 month old boy experienced a simple febrile seizure 14 hours after dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> at home. Earlier on the same day, fever had been recorded as part of the routine reactogenicity monitoring. A few hours after the episode of convulsion he was seen at the district hospital, and found to be well. Physical examination and laboratory assessment did not show any evidence of infectious disease. He was treated with paracetamol only. He was kept for observation for 2 days and went home thereafter.</p><p>Two children in the study were diagnosed with intussusception. The first case was a 14 month old boy who presented on the day following the first RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> vaccination (0,1-month schedule group) with mucoid bloody diarrhoea, vomiting and fever, and was treated with oral antibiotics. Five days later he returned with a mass in his epigastrium. The second case was a 7 month old boy who presented fifteen days after first RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> vaccination (0,1,7-month schedule group) with a 1 day history of bloody mucoid stool, abdominal pain and a mass in the epigastrium. Both children were referred to the tertiary level university hospital where the diagnosis of intussusception was confirmed and treated surgically. Both children recovered fully. On the basis of the absence of obvious pathogenic explanation for these vaccine components being causative of intussusceptions, as well as the fact that they occurred at different time intervals after vaccination and following vaccination with different vaccine formulations, the investigators considered the intussusceptions not to be related to vaccination. The DSMB concurred with this assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Non-serious adverse events and reactogenicity</title><p>For each RTS,S vaccine formulation, reactogenicity seen after the first two doses in the three vaccine schedule groups was similar. Therefore the description of reactogenicity focuses on the data from the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month schedules and data from the 0,1-month schedule groups is not presented here.</p><p>Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom.

There were no non-serious AEs estimated by the investigators to be related to vaccination.</p><p>Haematology (haemoglobin, WBC, platelets) and biochemistry (ALT, creatinine) values outside the normal range were infrequent. Three subjects had values graded 3. One subject in the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> (0,1,7-month) group had elevated ALT at month 7 (416 U/mL). The child was found to be well, followed up clinically and the ALT level was normal at the next visit.

This trend was also observed for anti-hepatitis B antibodies (data not shown). The general conclusions from analysis of site-specific results (data not shown) were similar to those following review of pooled data from the two research centres as presented here.</p><p>Within each vaccination schedule group, the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulation consistently yielded higher peak anti-CS responses as compared to RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>.

With the same schedule, the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> formulation induced anti-CS GMTs of 367 EU/mL (95&#x00025; CI 293, 459). With the 0,1,7-month schedule at month 8, anti-CS GMTs were 373 EU/mL (95&#x00025; CI 311, 447) for the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulation and 272 EU/mL (95&#x00025; CI 219, 339) for the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> formulation. With the 0,1-month schedule at month 2, anti-CS GMTs were 483 EU/mL (95&#x00025; CI 395, 591) for the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulation and 318 EU/mL (95&#x00025; CI 269, 377) for the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> formulation.</p><p>At month 7, subjects having received two vaccine doses (i.e. the 0,1-month schedule) had lower anti-CS GMTs (AS02<sub>D</sub>: 35 EU/mL [95&#x00025; CI: 26, 46]; AS01<sub>E</sub>: 53 EU/mL [95&#x00025; CI: 41, 68]) than subjects having received 3 vaccine doses (0,1,2-month schedule) (AS02<sub>D</sub>: 78 EU/mL [95&#x00025; CI: 58, 106]; AS01<sub>E</sub>: 162 EU/mL [95&#x00025; CI: 134, 196]).

The trial reported here is the next in a series of age de-escalation steps towards the EPI age range, contributing to adjuvant and schedule selection. This study is the first comparative assessment of both candidate vaccines in young children aged 5 to 17 months and assessed three different vaccination schedules (0,1-, 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-months).</p><p>Overall, both the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulations were shown to have a good safety profile and were well tolerated. One subject experienced an episode of simple febrile seizure considered to be related to vaccination following the third dose of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> at month 7. In the RTS,S program to date 5315 doses of RTS,S/AS02 and 3149 doses of RTS,S/AS01 have been administered to 1864 and 1145 children under 6 years of age, respectively. Out of these one other case of simple febrile seizure related to vaccination has occurred <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Post vaccination febrile seizures are a well described complication of vaccine-related fever <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bonhoeffer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the great majority of the cases, such as in these that have occurred in the RTS,S programme, it is benign, and resolves without sequelae. Two cases of intussusception (one in a RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> vaccinated child, one in a RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> vaccinated child) were reported in this study. Intussusception is a condition known to occur in this age group, including in Ghana, although precise incidence rates are unknown <xref rid="pone.0007302-Archampong1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. No other case of intussusception has been described in the RTS,S program to date.</p><p>The analysis of reactogenicity data indicated that although recipients of the malaria vaccine candidates reported more local and general symptoms than recipients of the rabies vaccine, grade 3 reactions were infrequent. A trend towards less local reactogenicity in recipients of the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> vaccine formulation as compared to RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> recipients was found.</p><p>In a previous study in children aged 18 months to 4 years from Gabon, both candidate vaccines were shown to have a good safety profile and to be well tolerated <xref rid="pone.0007302-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In the study in Gabon, an increase in solicited local symptoms of pain and swelling at the injection site with subsequent doses of either vaccine was observed; this was not seen in this study. More recently, the RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> formulation coadministered to infants with other routinely delivered EPI immunisations, and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> administered to children aged 5 to 17 months from Kenya and Tanzania, had favourable safety profiles <xref rid="pone.0007302-Abdulla1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Both candidate vaccines were highly immunogenic for anti-CS antibodies. Following two doses of either RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> or RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>, all subjects had seropositive levels of anti-CS antibodies. The peak anti-CS titres were higher than those observed in previous studies in children with RTS,S candidate vaccines <xref rid="pone.0007302-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Macete1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bojang2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Macete2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This may be related to the fact that in this study all children had been previously immunised against hepatitis B. Indeed, it has previously been observed that prior HBV vaccination appears to promote the immune response to both HBs and CS antigen components of RTS,S/AS02 and RTS,S/AS01 <xref rid="pone.0007302-Lell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Such high anti-CS and &#x02013;HBs titres were also observed following administration of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> to young children previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine in another study <xref rid="pone.0007302-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The antibody response to the CS protein is believed to be an important component or marker of protective immunity although, to date, no protective threshold of CS antibody response has been determined. Future studies with the RTS,S candidate vaccines will investigate the priming effect of a neonatal dose of hepatitis B vaccine on the evolution of CS titres induced by the malaria vaccine.</p><p>Recipients of RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> consistently had higher peak anti-CS responses compared to recipients of RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub>, irrespective of vaccination schedule. Although responses in subjects who received just 2 doses (i.e. 0,1-month schedule) were high, the decline from peak GMTs was more important than in subjects on a 3 dose regimen. Anti-CS titres were higher at month 10 in children on the 0,1,7-month schedule as compared to the 0,1,2-month schedule, for both RTS,S vaccine groups. At month 19 this was still apparent in children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS02<sub>D</sub> but in children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> they were similar.</p><p>In an attempt to estimate antibody response over the whole timeframe of the study, while acknowledging the variation in the responses over time, AUCs standardised over time were evaluated. The evaluation over the whole study duration (AUC19) showed that mean responses with the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulation were similar for both the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month schedules, which were higher than those seen with the two doses schedule. Although the anti-CS response following two doses was high, the peak, AUC7 and AUC19 in the 0,1,2-month schedules were higher. A two doses schedule is therefore probably not optimal.</p><p>Peak responses for anti-CS GMTs were observed in the 0,1,2-month schedules, which was an unexpected result as, in line with licensed Hepatitis B vaccine schedules, trials with a hepatitis B vaccine have shown that increasing the interval between the second and third dose enhances humoral response <xref rid="pone.0007302-Hadler1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007302-Jilg1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Indeed, the highest peak responses for anti-HBs GMTs were observed in the 0,1,7-month schedules as compared to the 0,1,2-month schedule when considering the peak (one month post last dose) responses. It is not clear why the delayed third dose is associated with a marked increase in HBs response but not CS response and will need to be investigated further in delayed booster studies.</p><p>This study confirmed the previously demonstrated high immunogenicity of RTS,S based vaccines for anti-HBs antibodies, and that this is true also in subjects primed with hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>In two similar Ghanaian populations, antibody responses were high though there was some variability between the two centers. Slightly higher antibody levels were found in KHRC participants, as compared to KCCR/SMS participants. Some variability magnitude of anti CS response between centers has previously been observed and the precise source of this heterogeneity is unclear. Future multicenter Phase 3 RTS,S studies will further characterize heterogeneity in vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in different geographical locations.</p><p>This trial demonstrated that both formulations of the candidate malaria vaccines, RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> and RTS,S/AS02D, were well tolerated and highly immunogenic for anti-CS and anti-HBs antibodies in young children aged 5&#x02013;17 months living in a malaria-endemic area. RTS,S based vaccines were well tolerated in children having previously received a full course of anti-HBs vaccine in infancy as part of EPI. The RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> formulation showed a trend towards less local reactogenicity and demonstrated higher immunogenicity for anti-CS antibodies. The 3 dose schedules were more immunogenic than 2 dose schedules with AUC analyses for anti-CS antibody levels and were comparable between the 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> schedules. In summary, this study supports further evaluation of the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> candidate vaccine with both 0,1,2- and 0,1,7-month schedules in infants, and when co-administered with standard EPI antigens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007302.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007302.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007302.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(1.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007302.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants and their parents, the community members and the Chiefs in the Kintampo and Agogo traditional areas, the Management and Staff of KNUST/KCCR/SMS, Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kintampo Municipal Hospital, Ghana Health Service; the Kintampo North and South Health Directorates, KHRC, LSHTM, PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), INDEPTH, Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance (MCTA) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
