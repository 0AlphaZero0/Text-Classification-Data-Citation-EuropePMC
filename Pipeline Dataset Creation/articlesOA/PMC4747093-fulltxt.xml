Somatic alterations have been predominantly discovered in breast cancer patients of European ancestry; however, little is known about somatic aberration in patients of other ethnic groups including Asians. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted in DNA extracted from tumor and matched adjacent normal tissue samples from eleven early onset breast cancer patients who were included in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. We discovered 159 somatic missense and ten nonsense mutations distributed among 167 genes. The most frequent 50 somatic mutations identified by WES were selected for validation using Sequenom MassARRAY system in the eleven breast cancer patients and an additional 433 tumor and 921 normal tissue/blood samples from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. Among these 50 mutations selected for validation, 32 were technically validated. Within the validated mutations, somatic mutations in the <italic>TRPM6, HYDIN, ENTHD1</italic>, and <italic>NDUFB10</italic> genes were found in two or more tumor samples in the replication stage. Mutations in the <italic>ADRA1B, CBFB, KIAA2022</italic>, and <italic>RBM25</italic> genes were observed once in the replication stage.

In the United States, there were 226,870 new cases diagnosed and 39,510 deaths in 2012 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite improvements in survival, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of female cancer mortality. It is well-established that breast cancer genomes harbor complex mutational landscapes, often characterized by point mutations, small insertions and deletions (Indels), and large structure changes across the genome [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such somatic DNA changes in the tumor genome may result in an inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation or deregulation of oncogenes. Comprehensive identification of these somatic changes is necessary to better understand biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, which may help to predict prognosis and to advance the development of targeted therapies.</p><p id="P3">To date, large scale genome-wide sequencing projects in breast tumors have identified several key breast cancer related genes, such as <italic>TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MAP3K1</italic>, and <italic>CDKN1B</italic> [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies, however, were conducted in breast cancer patients predominantly of European ancestry. Given the difference in breast cancer subtypes, clinical characteristics, incidence, and survival as well as risk profiles among women of different ethnic backgrounds, somatic aberrations may differ across ethnic groups [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, compared with lung cancer patients of European ancestry, Asian patients carry more <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations and exhibit higher clinical response rates to <italic>EGFR</italic> tyrosine kinase inhibitors [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, somatic <italic>EGFR</italic> activating mutations in breast cancer were specifically observed in Asian ancestry patients but not in European ancestry patients [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4">To identify novel somatic alternations of breast cancer, we performed whole-exome sequencing in the breast tumor and matched normal DNA samples from eleven Chinese patients.

Details of the study have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, cases were women diagnosed with breast cancer between August 1996 and March 1998, 25 to 64 years of age, without a previous cancer diagnosis, and alive at the time of interview. All cases were identified via the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry. Medical charts were reviewed using a standard protocol to obtain information on cancer treatment, clinical stages, and cancer characteristics, such as estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Two senior pathologists reviewed all tissue slides to confirm the diagnosis. Among the SBCS, most study participants provided blood samples for germline based genetic studies [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We also collected fresh tumor tissue samples and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples from a portion of the breast cancer patients from the SBCS. During surgery, tumor tissue samples were obtained from the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from the distal edge of the resection. These samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen as soon as possible, typically within 10 minutes. Samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. All patients were interviewed at the time of recruitment.</p><p id="P6">It has been suggested that patients with early-onset of disease may have a stronger genetic component. In the present study, only patients with early onset of breast cancer were selected for the whole exome sequencing in the discovery stage. The patients were 33 years on average when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. In the replication stage, additional 433 tumor samples and 921 normal tissue/blood samples from the SBCS participants were analyzed. These samples include 158 paired tumor-blood or tumor-normal tissue samples, 275 additional tumor tissue samples, 136 normal tissue samples, and 352 blood samples. Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) following the manufacturer's protocol. Approval of the study was granted by the relevant institutional review boards in both China and the United States.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Exome capture, library construction and sequencing</title><p id="P7">Libraries were constructed by shearing genomic DNA and ligating Illumina paired-end adaptors.

The purified capture products were then amplified and subjected to 72 base paired-end sequencing on the Illumina GAII instrument according to Illumina's standard protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Read mapping</title><p id="P8">First, we shifted the Illumina base quality scores (Phred + 64) to the Sanger scale (Phred + 33) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Then, we performed alignment to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) algorithm (version 0.7.0) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in default parameters. Aligned reads were processed and sorted with SAMtools [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We then marked duplicates with Picard (version 1.60) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net">http://picard.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) and carried out regional realignment and base quality score recalibration (BQSR) using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 2.1.8) [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with default setting. We used QPLOT in default requirement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/QPLOT">http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/QPLOT</ext-link>) for sequencing data quality assessment and statistics summary.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Somatic mutations calling</title><p id="P9">We conducted two sets of somatic mutations calling. First, we used GATK's Unified Genotyper to call variants simultaneously on all BAM files from the tumor/normal tissue DNA. To decrease the false positive discovery rate, we applied the following criteria to ensure that only high quality reads were used to call and only high quality variants were included in the final analyses: (1) only using reads with a mapping quality score (MAPQ) &#x02265; 20 and bases with base quality score (BQ) &#x02265; 20; (2) only including variants with genotype quality score (GQ) &#x02265; 30 and depth &#x02265; 30 in both tumor and normal tissue DNA; (3) only including variants exclusively observed in tumor samples.</p><p id="P10">We also used VarScan2 (v2.3.3) software [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to identify somatic variants for each paired BAM files from the same patient with default parameters. We also included somatic variants within 100 bp of a target region. In the filter step, we used the somatic Filter command implemented in the VarScan2 program with the following options: -somatic-p-value=0.05 and a minimum of 10&#x000d7; coverage (&#x02212;min-coverage 10) for both the tumor and matched normal samples. We additionally examined the read pileups for each mutation of each BAM file from both calling sets by using GATK&#x02019;s Pileup option. Finally, we combined somatic variants called by both GATK toolkit and VarScan2 program for further analyses. We obtained the known somatic mutation dataset (Level 2, version 2.4) in breast cancer studies from TCGA data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp</ext-link>).

PCR primers and allelic-specific extension primers were designed with the MassARRAY Assay Design 4.0 software, and alleles of each mutation were detected through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All calls from Sequenom Typer Analyzer software (version 4.0.20) were manually confirmed by examining the spectra. Peaks for two alleles were checked against the background of each well, and a mutation call was confirmed if the peak was unique to that allele. Blinded duplicates and negative controls (distilled water) were included in each of the 384-well plates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S9"><title>Results</title><sec id="S10"><title>Patient characteristics and sequencing statistics</title><p id="P13">Clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients included in the present study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Each tumor sample carried an average of 63 somatic mutations with a range of 32&#x02013;133 mutations. The number is comparable to the previous TCGA observation with the mean of 56 mutations [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P15">As expected, most mutations (93%) were observed only once.

Among the 237 protein-coding related mutations, 159 were missense, 10 nonsense, 4 splicing, and 64 synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Among the six possible mutation classes, including C&#x0003e;T/G&#x0003e;A, C&#x0003e;G/G&#x0003e;C, C&#x0003e;A/G&#x0003e;T, T&#x0003e;C/A&#x0003e;G, T&#x0003e;A/A&#x0003e;T, and T&#x0003e;G/A&#x0003e;C, the C&#x0003e;T/G&#x0003e;A transition dominated the mutation spectra, accounting for 34.2% of the total mutations. The T&#x0003e;A/A&#x0003e;T and C&#x0003e;G/G&#x0003e;C mutations were the least frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Although only three ER&#x02212; tumors were surveyed in this study, a similar pattern was reported elsewhere [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, we did not find any association between the frequency of somatic mutations and tumor stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Nine mutations were detected in independent samples in the replication stage. Especially, mutations in the <italic>PIK3CA, TRPM6, HYDIN, ENTHD1</italic> and <italic>NDUFB10</italic> genes were observed in multiple samples in the replication stage.</p><p id="P19">One of the most significant findings was the recurrent R1122Q mutation in the <italic>TRPM6</italic> gene, which was detected in 6 of 444 breast cancer tumor samples in the present study. The <italic>TRPM6</italic> gene plays a crucial role in magnesium homeostasis and epithelial magnesium transport. Both basic and pre-clinical studies show that the magnesium flux by TRP magnesium channels is highly related with tumor cell proliferation and cycle, angiogenesis, tumor growth and reprogramming, as well as metastasis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The R1122Q mutation occurs at the topological domain of <italic>TRPM6</italic> towards the cytoplasm, according to the Uniprot database annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84</ext-link>). Thereby, dysfunction of the <italic>TRPM6</italic> protein may affect the cation homeostasis leading to the tumor development. Recently, Stephens et al. reported two somatic mutations (p.T1822A and p.A1765T) in the <italic>TRPM6</italic> gene from screening 100 breast cancer patients of European ancestry [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the mutation R1122Q that was observed in the present study was not reported in the study of Stephens et al. [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Meanwhile, another study, which included 108 breast cancer patients from Mexico and Vietnam using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, did not discover any mutations in the <italic>TRPM6</italic> gene [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mutations in other members of the <italic>TRPM</italic> gene family were also reported in breast cancer tumor genome, including three mutations in each of the <italic>TRPM8, TRPM3</italic>, and <italic>TRPM1</italic> genes [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, mutations in the <italic>TRPM6</italic> gene were also discovered in patients of non-tumor diseases, such as hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="P20">In addition to the observed recurrent missense mutation (T3867A) in the <italic>HYDIN</italic> gene in the present study, ten other mutations have been reported in previous studies [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], though each was observed only once in 100 breast cancer patients. The mutation site (T3867A) observed in the present study shows evolutionarily high conservation across all vertebrates with 4.26 of Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) score, implying potentially functional constraint of this mutation site in the <italic>HYDIN</italic> gene. However, there is less direct evidence linking the biological role of the <italic>HYDIN</italic> gene to breast carcinogenesis. It will be of interest to determine the mechanistic and phenotypic consequences of <italic>HYDIN</italic> mutations in the breast and other tumor cells. We also detected a recurrent mutation (I493V) in the <italic>ENTHD1</italic> gene of four patients. However, in the previously two exome sequencing studies of breast cancer, no <italic>ENTHD1</italic> mutations were observed [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The functional feature of this gene is largely unknown. A recent study showed that the <italic>ENTHD1</italic> protein might interact with <italic>HDAC6</italic> [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that the <italic>ENTHD1</italic> may be associated with the histone acetyltransferase activity.</p><p id="P21">In the present study, we also found recurrent novel missense mutations in the <italic>CBFB, ADRA1B, KHDRBS1, NDUFB10, RBM25</italic>, and <italic>KIAA2022</italic> genes. Among them, the <italic>CBFB</italic> oncogene has been documented into the COSMIC cancer Gene Census, a gene category for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The <italic>CBFB</italic> gene plays a critical role in tumor cell growth and proliferation [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other mutations in this gene were recently reported in breast cancer patients, including nonsense mutations at E152 and R83 and truncating frame shift mutations at E16, Q67 and Y96 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The <italic>CBFB</italic> mutations were found to be accompanied by deletions of the gene encoding its binding partner, <italic>RUNX1</italic>, in some breast cancers [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the <italic>ADRA1B</italic> gene, which encodes adrenoceptor alpha 1B, a previous study showed this gene is highly expressed in breast tumors with increased tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcome [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], suggesting this gene may perform a cancer-promoting role. The <italic>KHDRBS1</italic> gene encodes KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1. The protein appears to have many functions and may be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including alternative splicing, cell cycle regulation, RNA 3'-end formation, and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The <italic>NDUFB10</italic> gene encodes NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 10, an integral factor in Complex 1 on the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Phosphorylation of NDUFB10 by Src kinase could participate in the development of the proliferative phenotype of glycolytic cancer cells, such as 143B and DU145 cells by preserving complex I activity [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, no mutations were observed in the previous breast cancer exome sequencing data [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The <italic>RBM25</italic> gene encodes the RNA binding motif protein 25, one of the RNA-binding regulators that direct the alternative splicing of apoptotic factors such as Bcl-x [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three other mutations, R708Q, H6D, and G130A, were observed in one study [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but not in another study [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A different mutation, <italic>R348Q</italic>, in the <italic>KIAA2022</italic> gene is observed in breast cancer tumor in a previous study [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Taken together, the discovery of some novel somatic mutations partially indicate the difference of somatic aberrations across ethnic groups of patients. Further comprehensive comparison in genomic aberrations may help to develop cancer therapeutics strategies for the ethnic-specific groups of patients.</p><p id="P22">There are several limitations in this study. The small sample size in the discovery stage of the present study limits the power to detect driver mutations and compare the mutation profiles stratified by disease subtype. Biological samples used in the present study were collected a couple of years ago, which may affect somatic mutations discovery. However, in the present study, we observed those recurrent somatic mutations such as the H1047R mutation in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene. Another limitation is that only a small portion of mutations were selected for replication. In addition, there are some differences in patient characteristics between the discovery and replication stage, such as age and ER/PR status. Small Indels as well as large structure changes were not investigated in the present study due to the high false positive rate using exome sequencing [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. No data were available for tumor purity, which may affect the mutation discovery and validation. Similar to other exome sequencing projects, although the high density of read coverage across target region is obtained from the whole-exome sequencing, with over 60-fold on average, there is a small portion of the coding regions in low or no read coverage due to the capturing design.</p><p id="P23">In summary, we discovered novel somatic mutations in the <italic>TRPM6, HYDIN, ENTHD1</italic> and <italic>NDUFB10</italic> genes in early onset Chinese breast cancer patients through whole exome sequencing. These mutations were replicated in independent breast cancer patients. Our findings of these novel mutations may provide new clues regarding the molecular mechanism of breast cancer carcinogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><p id="P31">The authors wish to thank all individuals who took part in these studies.
