All women who became pregnant (n = 1813) in each of the 3 groups received daily IFA (60 mg Fe and 400 &#x003bc;g FA) through delivery. Hematological indicators were assessed at baseline (pre-pregnancy), during pregnancy, 3 months post-partum, and in cord blood.

In South East Asia, the burden of anemia is particularly high and more than 1 in 4 women suffer from anemia during pregnancy. The causes of anemia are varied but iron deficiency has been identified as the most common and has been linked with increased risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and adverse birth outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Iron supplementation during pregnancy is a common strategy to combat anemia. Evidence from controlled trials have shown that this strategy can reduce the incidence of anemia and iron deficiency anemia at term by nearly two-thirds and improve birth outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However maternal anemia remains a significant public health problem across the globe. Poor program implementation and utilization have been identified as key limiting factors for the success of these programs. In a review of 2003&#x02013;2009 Demographic and Health Survey data, less than 25% of women in South/South East Asia received iron supplements for at least 90 days during pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Often by the time a woman seeks prenatal care, it may be too late to build iron stores with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements given the high iron demands of pregnancy. Furthermore, women may also miss the critical preconception/early pregnancy period for improving folate status to reduce neural tube defects [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There is growing recognition on the importance of adolescent and women&#x02019;s preconception nutritional status to improve maternal and infant outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Women who enter pregnancy with suboptimal iron stores may be at higher risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The World Health Organization recommends intermittent IFA supplementation for menstruating women as one of the strategies to reduce anemia and improve iron status among women of reproductive age (WRA), in settings where anemia prevalence in this population is over 20% [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This recommendation was informed by evidence from controlled trials which showed that intermittent IFA reduced the risk of anemia by an average of 27%, in addition to improving hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Program experience with this policy from several countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Laos and Philippines have reported a wide range in average decreases in anemia (9% to 57%) [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, providing WRA with weekly IFA pre-pregnancy significantly reduced iron deficiency for the first two trimesters of pregnancy in Vietnam [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and improved iron status during pregnancy in Cambodia and Philippines [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the growing evidence on the potential of providing IFA supplements, preconception multiple micronutrients (MM) may also be an effective strategy for improving pregnancy and birth outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Women living in regions with endemic anemia often suffer from multiple nutrient deficiencies beyond just iron deficiency given the overall poor diet quality and limited access to sufficient nutrient rich foods. The 2015 Cochrane review on MM supplementation during pregnancy included 17 trials (involving 137,791 women) primarily in low and middle-income countries and concluded that compared to IFA or folic acid (FA), MM supplementation significantly decreased LBW (12%), small-for-gestational age (SGA, 10%) and stillbirth (9%) [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The use of daily MM supplements during pregnancy has also been associated with a significant increase of 52.6 g in birth weight compared to IFA supplementation alone [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, observational studies suggest that consumption of MM supplements before or during the time of conception is associated with a reduced risk of fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and low birth weight [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However while there is compelling evidence for MM supplementation during pregnancy, the overall quality of the preconception evidence is low with little or no information from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT).</p><p>Thus, there remain several gaps in our understanding of the impact of pre-pregnancy supplementation and there is need for evidence based interventions in the preconception period [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In order to address these gaps, we conducted a large randomized controlled trial (PRECONCEPT study) evaluating the effects of preconceptional micronutrient interventions on maternal and child health outcomes in rural Vietnam [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We have previously reported the effect of the intervention on birth outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact providing additional pre-pregnancy weekly iron-folic acid (IFA) or multiple micronutrients (MM- 15 vitamins and minerals; including IFA) compared to only folic acid (FA) on improving iron status and anemia during pregnancy and early postpartum in mothers and at birth in their offspring.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design, setting and participants</title><p>The study design, trial profile and characteristics of the study sample have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, we conducted a randomized, double-blind controlled trial in Thai Nguyen, a mountainous province in the north of Vietnam. A total of 5011 currently married women aged 18&#x02013;40 years, who were planning on becoming pregnant in the next year, were recruited from 20 communes selected from four districts in Thai Nguyen province. Exclusion criteria included being pregnant at the time of recruitment, consuming IFA or MM supplements in the previous 2 months, being severely anemic (Hb &#x0003c; 7 g/L), and having history of high risk pregnancy or chronic hematological diseases. Women with severe anemia were referred to the local health clinic for treatment.</p><p>All eligible women were randomly assigned to one of three groups for weekly pre-pregnancy supplementation: 1) folic acid (FA, 2800 &#x003bc;g&#x02013;control), 2) iron and folic acid (IFA, 2800 &#x003bc;g FA+ 60 mg iron) or 3) multiple micronutrients (MM). The composition of the MM supplement was based on the UNIMMAP international multiple micronutrient preparation [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] used in daily prenatal trials with a few modifications, namely the same amounts of iron and folic acid as the weekly IFA supplement and a higher amount of Vitamin D (600 IU) to be consistent with the recent Institute of Medicine recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The micronutrient composition of the supplements is shown in <xref rid="pone.0167416.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Before the start of the supplementation protocol, all participants were dewormed with albendazole (400 mg) to treat parasitic infections that were prevalent in the study settings [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Once women became pregnant they stopped weekly preconception supplementation and started receiving prenatal supplements containing 60 mg of iron and 400 ug of FA to be taken daily through delivery as recommended by World Health Organization WHO [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The supplement preparations (MM, IFA, and FA) were physically indistinguishable. The tablet containers were labeled by the manufacturer with letter and color codes that were not disclosed to the researchers until the data collection as per the original study design was complete (when the youngest child in the cohort turned 3 mo). All investigators, study personnel and participants were blinded to group assignment.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0167416.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

The VHW directly observed the consumption of one tablet during their visit, and called or used text messages the weeks in between her visits to remind the participants to take the subsequent tablet. Compliance was based on a count of empty capsule packets stored in the women&#x02019;s homes. Women were encouraged to consume supplements on an empty stomach at the same time every week to enhance compliance, absorption, and minimize side-effects. VHWs also asked women about their menses since the last visit and referred women to Commune Health Center for pregnancy test and prenatal care if women reported that their last menstrual period had occurred &#x0003e;5 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Hemoglobin concentrations were measured from capillary blood samples (by finger prick) at baseline (preconception), each trimester during pregnancy, and 3 months postpartum for both women and their children using a portable field B-Hemoglobin Analyzer [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Adjusted generalized linear models were used to examine the impact of preconception supplementation on anemia and iron stores. Data were first analyzed using intention to treat approach for all the outcomes of interest, followed by per protocol comparisons that took into account a pre-specified minimum duration of intervention, namely at least 26 weeks before conception. We also adjusted for gestational age (because iron markers are measured at different time point of pregnancy), duration of supplements (to account for varying time from enrollment to conception in different groups) and inflammation indicators (to account for the effects of infection on iron stores) in all models. Finally, we investigated whether the effects of supplementation varied by baseline anemia, iron and nutrition status (BMI &#x0003c;18.5 vs. BMI &#x02265;18.5).

These results are in contrast to previous evidence primarily from observational studies [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and one RCT [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] showing that weekly consumption of iron containing supplements before conception increased hemoglobin concentrations and prevented anemia during pregnancy. However, we demonstrated modest improvements in iron stores during pregnancy among women who received preconception MM or IFA. Furthermore, there were significant increases in plasma ferritin in cord blood and in mothers at 3 months postpartum among women who consumed the MM or IFA supplement for at least 26 weeks, compared to FA. To our knowledge this is the first RCT to study the effect of preconception supplementation of MM, IFA or FA on anemia and iron status during pregnancy and post-partum</p><p>Approximately 20% of the women had anemia at baseline. A women&#x02019;s preconception anemia status was a strong predictor of maternal hemoglobin throughout pregnancy. Despite supplementation both before and during pregnancy, the difference in hemoglobin among anemic and non-anemic women at baseline remained throughout gestation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167416.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). This may be due in part to the fact that only 3% of women had iron-deficiency anemia. This contrasts with recent global estimates that suggest 50% of anemia in non-pregnant and pregnant women is amendable to iron supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The differences in the etiology of anemia among different settings could account for the mixed impact of preconception supplementation on anemia in this study compared to others [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The low levels of iron-deficiency anemia at baseline in our study population may explain the lower potential to benefit from supplements compared to other settings where iron deficiency is the primary cause of anemia. This low level of iron deficiency was surprising given the poor dietary quality and high levels of underweight among women in this population [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Traditional Vietnamese diets are dominated by starchy staples (mainly rice), are lower in fat and despite increases in protein intake over past two decades only about a third of protein comes from animals sources foods (which have higher bioavailability for several micronutrients) [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Prior research in Vietnam has also implicated a low prevalence of anemia (12%) and iron deficiency (14%) despite a high prevalence of other micronutrient deficiencies of public health concern (zinc deficiency (67%) and vitamin B12 deficiency (11.7%) [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Likewise, recent studies from Cambodia [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], Malawi [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] have reported a low prevalence of iron deficiency among women.</p><p>Other key factors that may contribute to anemia include: other nutrient deficiencies (folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin A), genetic traits (including sickle-cell anemia and thalassaemia), malaria, schistosomiasis, hookworm and trichuris infection, and HIV and some non-communicable diseases [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We have previously examined dietary intake in our population using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at enrollment [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Many women were not meeting the estimated average requirement for key micronutrients (percent below estimated average requirement- EAR: 25% for iron, 16% for zinc, 54% for folate, 64% for vitamin B12 and 27% for vitamin A) [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, there were disparities by income where women in low SES households were at greatest risk for not meeting dietary nutrient requirements. In addition, we have examined factors associated with anemia at baseline in our study population [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and found that beyond ferritin concentration, being an ethnic minority (-0.24 mg/dL compared with the Kinh ethnic majority), number of children (-0.17) and socioeconomic status (0.09) were directly associated with Hb concentration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Retinol Binding Protein (RBP- a marker of vitamin A status) was also directly associated with Hb (0.27 mg/dL) and with ferritin (0.09 mg/dL), whereas hookworm infection was indirectly associated with Hb (-0.11) through RBP and ferritin. However, similar to the low levels of iron deficiency in our population only 4% of women were vitamin A deficient. Thus, based on our existing dietary data we anticipated that other nutrient deficiencies namely B-12 and folic acid may contribute to anemia in this population; however our findings showed no additional benefit of the 15 vitamins and minerals (including iron and folic acid) in the MM supplement compared to IFA or only FA to reduce anemia. Infections and/or inflammation which have been shown to influence biomarkers of iron status [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] did not also appear to be an issue since less than 5% of the cohort had elevated CRP or AGP. Although all women in our study also received the recommended dose of 400 mg albendazole for controlling parasitic infections such as hookworm at baseline, it is possible that the infection was not fully cleared and/or reinfection may have occurred. Finally, we lack data on the prevalence of genetic hemoglobin disorders which may be related to anemia in our population and might have influenced the response to our intervention [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further research is needed to better understand the potential role of genetic traits that may also be affecting iron metabolism in this population.</p><p>The impact of supplementation was also examined by baseline anemia and iron status to examine any differences by potential to benefit. Surprisingly the largest difference in plasma ferritin was observed among women who were already iron-sufficient at baseline. This is counterintuitive as we would have expected the more deficient women to respond better to iron supplementation. It is possible, however, that the small proportion of women who remained iron-deficient in this sample were not responsive to micronutrient supplementation, and examining genetic causes or implementing other interventions targeting malabsorption may be needed. It should be noted however that we found no differences by intervention group in the proportion of women with ferritin concentrations over 150 mg/L or elevated hemoglobin (&#x0003e;13g/dL). Thus, while the potential to benefit was low given the relatively iron replete population at baseline, there did not appear to be any harm or risk of iron overload in this population. This is important to establish as countries are beginning to consider preconception supplementation programs and data on micronutrients deficiencies may be limited. The 20% anemia among WRA in this population is at the borderline of WHO recommendations for weekly IFA supplementation. This study provides evidence that both MM and IFA preconception supplementation in iron replete populations provides some benefit of increasing iron stores but does not place women at risk of iron overload.</p><p>Our study has several strengths, including the double blinded RCT study design, the large sample size, and the detailed follow-up through pregnancy and postpartum by a well-trained team of local health professionals. The most unique strength is its focus on preconception, and the inclusion of biomarkers of iron status and hematological indices across the continuum from preconception through pregnancy and the first 3 months postpartum. The study however is not without limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, we lack data on other micronutrient biomarkers and genetic information to identify the etiology of anemia in our population. However, we do not expect these characteristics to differ by group due to the randomized design and availability of data showing that the three groups were similar for several socio-demographic characteristics and dietary intakes at baseline. Another concern is the variability in the duration of the intervention as it depended on the time to conception. However, this did not differ by intervention group and we evaluated our results by controlling for it and also conducted a per-protocol analysis that included only women who received the supplements for at least 26 weeks. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that although we found statistically significant differences in plasma ferritin, these differences were small and the biological significance may be limited, especially for women who do not have low ferritin to begin with. There is increasing recognition of the importance of preconception nutrition for fertility, embryogenesis, implantation and placentation, which may have implications for preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation [<xref rid="pone.0167416.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However it is unclear at what level of nutrient deficiency these processes are impacted. Further research is needed to examine the functional impact of preconception supplementation on neonatal outcomes and other outcomes such as cognitive ability and/or chronic disease may not manifest until later life.</p><p>In conclusion, preconception supplementation with MM or IFA in comparison to FA alone resulted in modest increases in prenatal plasma ferritin. In addition, among women who consumed the preconception MM or IFA supplement for &#x02265; 26 weeks, plasma ferritin concentrations in cord blood and mothers at 3 months postpartum were significantly higher when compared to women who received only FA. Despite high compliance with the interventions both before and during pregnancy, anemia remained prevalent and did not respond to the micronutrient interventions. Further research is needed to characterize the etiology of anemia in this population in order to develop effective interventions for reducing prenatal anemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167416.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167416.s001.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167416.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Hemoglobin changes during pregnancy, by anemia status and treatment group.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167416.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167416.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167416.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167416.s004"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Study Protocol&#x02013;Method paper.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167416.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0167416.s005"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Original study protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0167416.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this research was provided by the Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition and the Micronutrient Initiative.
