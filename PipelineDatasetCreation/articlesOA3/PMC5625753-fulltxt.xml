Introduction</title><p>Anticoagulants are routinely prescribed for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. However, acute bleeding events in patients treated with oral anticoagulants are common [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The reported annual incidence of bleeding in anticoagulated patients is 15&#x02013;20% [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; major bleeding complications occur with an incidence of 1.7&#x02013;3.4% [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the United States, bleeding events in patients anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) account for more than 60,000 annual emergency room visits [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most common major bleeding complication of VKA therapy [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; in the recent results published from the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), GI bleeds represented 38% of major bleeding events in patients receiving warfarin [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. GI bleeding is three times more common in patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) &#x0003e;3 than in those with INR 2-3 [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. VKA-treated patients who experience acute major bleeding require rapid VKA reversal via the restoration of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (VKDFs); this can be achieved by administering plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs).</p><p>Though widely used, plasma has several disadvantages when used for VKA reversal, including time delays due to blood group typing and thawing of frozen plasma, the need for large volumes and the associated long infusion times to achieve the necessary factor levels, and increased risk of transfusion reactions, such as volume overload and transfusion-related acute lung injury [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PCCs are lyophilized products that are administered in smaller volumes over shorter periods of time; they are either activated or nonactivated. Activated PCCs are indicated for treatment of hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Nonactivated PCCs are either 3-factor (3F-PCC, containing significant quantities of factors II, IX, and X) or 4-factor (4F-PCC, containing factors II, IX, X, and clinically relevant amounts of factor VII [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]); these were initially developed for use in people with a congenital deficiency in VKDFs when purified specific coagulation factor is not available [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with some now also being used for prevention or treatment of bleeding associated with VKA treatment [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Two multinational, multicenter phase IIIb clinical trials compared 4F-PCC with plasma for urgent VKA reversal [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 4F-PCC was found to be noninferior to plasma for effective hemostasis and superior to plasma for rapid INR reduction in the study of patients with acute major bleeding [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and superior to plasma for both of these endpoints in the study of patients needing VKA reversal prior to an urgent surgery or invasive procedure [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. GI (and other nonvisible) bleeding was the most common type of bleeding reported in the acute major bleeding study, accounting for over 60% of bleeding events [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. GI bleeding also occurred in the study of patients needing VKA reversal prior to an urgent surgery or invasive procedure [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This post hoc analysis evaluates the subset of patients at two US sites who had GI bleeding in either of the trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>Full details of the design of the acute major bleeding study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00708435">NCT00708435</ext-link>) and the urgent surgical or invasive interventions study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00803101">NCT00803101</ext-link>) have been published [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Patients of both studies were randomly assigned (1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to receive either 4F-PCC (Kcentra, Beriplex P/N, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) or plasma. Both studies were sponsored by CSL Behring and performed in accordance with local ethics regulations; written informed consent was obtained from or on behalf of all patients.</p><p>Using data from two US sites that were major recruiters in the phase IIIb trials (University of Rochester Medical Center [URMC], Rochester, New York, and the Seton Family of Hospitals [SFH], Austin, Texas), we performed a post hoc analysis of patients who had GI bleeding events, to investigate the impact of 4F-PCC versus plasma treatment on time to procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria for the original studies have been published previously [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. GI bleeds were experienced by 113/212 (53%) patients in the acute major bleeding study. As bleeding events were not an inclusion criterion for the surgery study, such events were not systematically reported by all sites in that study. Patients from two study sites (URMC and SFH) who experienced GI bleeding events were included in this post hoc analysis. Together, these sites enrolled 112 patients (30%) for the phase III studies. Chart review and data abstraction for this post hoc analysis were performed by site personnel without additional funding.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Treatment</title><p>As previously described, on day 1, each patient received the assigned study treatment dosed according to baseline INR and body weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 4F-PCC was administered as a single intravenous dose, with a maximum infusion rate of 3&#x02009;IU/kg per min (equivalent to 8.4&#x02009;mL/min [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Plasma was infused intravenously with a study-protocol-recommended rate of 1&#x02009;U per 30&#x02009;min interval in the acute bleeding study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and as rapidly as possible and at the discretion of the treating clinical team in the urgent surgical procedure study [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. All patients were to receive vitamin K: in the bleeding study, by slow intravenous infusion dosed according to 2008 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines (5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mg) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or local clinical practice if different; in the surgery study, 2&#x02013;10&#x02009;mg (either oral or IV) at the clinician's discretion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Assessments</title><p>Full details of the assessments performed for this study have been previously described [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The primary endpoint of both studies was hemostatic efficacy and the coprimary endpoint was rapid INR reduction (&#x02264;1.3 at 0.5&#x02009;h after the end of study treatment infusion). In this post hoc analysis of patients experiencing GI bleeding events requiring surgical or invasive procedures, we assessed dose, volume, duration of infusion, type of procedure, and timings (from admission to initiation of study treatment and to the start of procedure and from initiation of study treatment to start of procedure and total hospital stay duration). Procedures performed in this cohort were endoscopic, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD], colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy; one small bowel follow-through was also performed. We also report safety outcomes for this cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Between-group differences for study treatment infusion volume, study treatment infusion time, time from admission to study treatment, time from admission to first procedure, and time from start of study treatment to first procedure were assessed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Between-group differences in hemostatic efficacy and INR reduction were evaluated using the chi-squared test/Fisher's exact test, depending on the cell sizes in the corresponding contingency table. A two-tailed 5% significance level was used throughout. This post hoc analysis was not powered to support the comparisons performed, so we treated testing of data as descriptive rather than inferential.</p><p>Quantitative data were summarized using mean/median and standard deviation/interquartile range (IQR).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3.

Unlike the original studies, in the small GI bleeds cohort, there was no difference in hemostatic efficacy between groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7. Safety</title><p>Safety outcomes were consistent with the results from the two original multicenter clinical trials [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 15/22 patients (68%) in the 4F-PCC group and 17/20 patients (85%) in the plasma group. Serious AEs were reported for 4/20 patients (18%) in the 4F-PCC group and 7/22 patients (35%) in the plasma group. There was 1 fluid overload event in the 4F-PCC group (5%) and 4 in the plasma group (20%); no events in either group were deemed related to study treatment by the investigator. Thromboembolic events were experienced by 1 patient in the 4F-PCC group (5%) and 2 patients (10%) in the plasma group; one of the events in the plasma group was considered treatment-related. There were no deaths in either group. Safety results are tabulated in Supplementary Material (Additional File 2: Table S2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>We found that time between start of infusion and start of procedure was significantly shorter in patients who received 4F-PCC compared with those in the plasma group. This reduced time to procedure was likely a consequence of the more rapid INR reduction and smaller infusion volume and therefore shorter infusion time with 4F-PCC versus plasma. The GI bleeds patient cohort mirrored the parent studies in that more of the 4F-PCC group than the plasma group met the coprimary endpoint of rapid INR reduction, demonstrating the efficacy of 4F-PCC. Though we did not see a similar effect on hemostatic efficacy, patient numbers in this study, as noted, were small.</p><p>It is important to establish whether a reduction in time to procedure is due to association or causation. Other factors which may affect time to procedure include hospital protocols guiding the initial management of patients with GI bleeding, the hemodynamic stability of the patient, and resource availability, including whether a 24-hour endoscopy service is available. However, as this analysis was performed using data from only 2 sites, variability in everything but individual patients should be limited.</p><p>Though in this small cohort we did not observe a significant difference in time between admission and start of study treatment between 4F-PCC- and plasma-treated patient groups, we speculate that a study of a larger sample would find a shorter time to treatment with 4F-PCC. This speculation is based on the established delays associated with plasma use, which requires blood typing and thawing [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and partly due to sample size considerations. We note that our study reflects clinical trial practice rather than routine clinical practice, and as such all patients would have experienced minor delays associated with trial participation caused by review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, consent, and randomization to treatment. Therefore, in routine clinical practice, time to treatment with either plasma or 4F-PCC would likely be shorter than that found in this study. Though availability of thawed plasma in an emergency department reduces time to plasma infusion [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we suggest that the larger infusion volume/longer infusion time with plasma versus 4F-PCC and the shorter time to reverse INR with 4F-PCC versus plasma will nonetheless consistently lead to an overall longer time to procedure with plasma versus 4F-PCC treatment in routine clinical practice.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Reducing Time to Procedure Could Improve Patient Outcomes</title><p>While the frequency of serious AEs and fluid overload was too small for meaningful statistical testing, our results appear consistent with the overall results of both trials. Plasma use is associated with an increased risk of fluid overload [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This has been associated with increased hospital costs and increased length of hospital stay [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the setting of a study with a larger number of patients than the present analysis, this safety consideration could potentially contribute to reduced mean hospital stay in patients treated with 4F-PCC versus plasma. No relationship between frequency of fluid overload events and dose was noted for either plasma or 4F-PCC in the total study cohorts [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the low number of events (<italic>n</italic> = 5) in the population of patients with GI bleeds included here precludes any further specific analysis. Though there were no deaths in this cohort, mortality due to GI bleeding could potentially be reduced by expediting diagnosis and bleeding control with earlier diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy. This is supported by a prospective analysis of patients with GI bleeding, which identified the lone independent risk factor associated with all-cause mortality in high risk patients (Glasgow-Blatchford Score &#x02265; 12) to be the time lapse between presentation and endoscopy [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. Resource Use in Patients with GI Bleeds</title><p>GI bleeding may require hospitalization, laboratory tests, blood product use, diagnostic workup, and interventional procedures, potentially including surgery. A systematic review of patients with upper and lower GI bleeding demonstrated substantial healthcare costs associated with these conditions [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this analysis, fewer patients received PRBC transfusions in the plasma group than the 4F-PCC group; however, given our small sample size, conclusive evidence for this should come from larger, future investigations.</p><p>In patients with GI bleeding, cost benefits may be expected from reducing hospital length of stay and the need for additional treatments or procedures (such as blood transfusions and further endoscopic or surgical intervention). However, the available data regarding cost benefits associated with early intervention in GI bleeding are conflicting [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). In the present analysis, reduced time to procedure was not associated with shorter hospital stay. Potential explanations for this include small sample size, comorbidities, and social factors affecting discharge.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. 4F-PCC Impact on Procedural Efficacy in Patients with GI Bleeds</title><p>Given the improvement in time to procedure with 4F-PCC, analyses of association between time to surgical or invasive procedures and the efficacy of such procedures (assessed via incidence of rebleeding) would be of interest. Though this was beyond the scope of our investigation, it is something that should be addressed by future work.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>4.4. Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The key limitation of this study is, as mentioned, its small sample size, as only a subset of patients from two larger studies were included. As this was a post hoc analysis, results cannot be considered conclusive and should be viewed as hypothesis-generating. In this study we benefitted from being able to draw on data not just for 4F-PCC-treated patients but also for a plasma-treated control group, to provide a balanced analysis of the outcomes tested herein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Overall, in this post hoc analysis in patients experiencing GI bleeding while being treated with VKA anticoagulants, leading to a requirement for urgent surgical or invasive procedures, 4F-PCC was associated with smaller infusion volumes, shorter infusion times, and shorter times from admission to procedure, compared with plasma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>Table S1: Corrective procedures that patients underwent, by center and treatment group.</p><p>Table S2: Summary of safety data.</p></caption><media xlink:href="8024356.f1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" orientation="portrait" id="d35e635" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The studies were sponsored by CSL Behring.
