Previous genome-wide screens with <italic>Tomato bushy stunt</italic> tombusvirus (TBSV) in a yeast model host revealed the involvement of seven ESCRT (<underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplexes <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport) proteins in viral replication. In this paper, we show that the expression of dominant negative Vps23p, Vps24p, Snf7p, and Vps4p ESCRT factors inhibited virus replication in the plant host, suggesting that tombusviruses co-opt selected ESCRT proteins for the assembly of the viral replicase complex. We also show that TBSV p33 replication protein interacts with Vps23p ESCRT-I and Bro1p accessory ESCRT factors. The interaction with p33 leads to the recruitment of Vps23p to the peroxisomes, the sites of TBSV replication. The viral replicase showed reduced activity and the minus-stranded viral RNA in the replicase became more accessible to ribonuclease when derived from <italic>vps23&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>vps24&#x00394;</italic> yeast, suggesting that the protection of the viral RNA is compromised within the replicase complex assembled in the absence of ESCRT proteins. The recruitment of ESCRT proteins is needed for the precise assembly of the replicase complex, which might help the virus evade recognition by the host defense surveillance system and/or prevent viral RNA destruction by the gene silencing machinery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plus-stranded RNA viruses, which are important pathogens of humans, animals and plants, replicate in infected cells by assembling viral replicase complexes consisting of viral- and host-coded proteins.

The identification of ESCRT proteins supports the idea that tombusvirus replication could depend on hijacking of ESCRT proteins, thus promoting efforts to test their roles in TBSV replication in this paper.

Fusion of the limiting membrane of MVB with the lysosome/vacuole will release the lipid/protein content of MVB into the lysosome, or alternatively, by fusing to the plasma membrane (exocytosis), it releases its content outside the cell <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Hurley1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Katzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Bowers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we show that ESCRT proteins previously identified in a genome-wide screen in yeast for affecting TBSV replication are involved in tombusvirus replication in plants.

In this work, we have shown that a set of ESCRT proteins is critical for optimal tombusvirus replication and the assembly of the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase complex. We found that over-expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III and Vps4p in plants reduced the accumulation of tombusvirus RNA by 10&#x02013;20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), inhibited the tombusvirus replicase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and reduced the number of spherules formed in infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). This inhibition seems to be specific for tombusviruses, since the distantly related TRV RNA accumulation was not inhibited in these plants. The inhibitory effect on tombusvirus replication by the over-expressed dominant negative ESCRT mutants seems to be direct, since the activity of the tombusvirus replicase was also reduced when isolated from these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Similarly, the activity of the tombusvirus replicase assembled <italic>in vitro</italic> was inhibited when we used the cellular membrane fraction from yeast lacking ESCRT-III or Vps4p proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, the replicase from <italic>vps24&#x00394;</italic> yeast was more sensitive to RNase treatment than the replicase preparation obtained from wt yeast, suggesting that Vps24p ESCRT-III protein is important to assemble RNase-insensitive replicase complexes. Moreover, DI-miR repRNA carrying the miR171 target sequence in the (-)strand RNA replicated poorly in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves expressing dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data suggest that the (-)strand repRNA in the replication intermediate within the viral replicase complex became more accessible to ribonuclease cleavage when the replicase was assembled in the presence of dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants. Altogether, the presented data support a role for ESCRT-III and Vps4p proteins in the formation of active tombusvirus replicase in plants and in yeast as well. Intriguingly, the role of ESCRT proteins seems to control the quality of the replicase complex assembly, making the viral RNAs within replicase complex more protected from ribonucleases. Based on these observations, we propose that ESCRT proteins help tombusviruses hide from host defense recognition and/or avoid the attack by the host defense during viral replication.</p><p>We also show that the recruitment of the ESCRT factors for virus replication is likely driven by interaction between the auxiliary p33 replication cofactor and Vps23p ESCRT-I protein and Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein.

We have shown previously that p33 can bind to Rsp5p, the yeast homologue of Nedd4 <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Barajas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This indicates that different viruses seem to exploit the ESCRT proteins through co-opting Vps23p (Tsg101), Bro1p (Alix) and/or Rsp5p (Nedd4) via direct protein-protein interactions. In addition, the ESCRT machinery is also recruited for cell division to separate the daughter cells from the mother cells through the process of cytokinesis. It has ben shown that the midbody resident protein Cep55 interacts with Tsg101 and Alix to recruit additional ESCRT proteins <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Carlton1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, these cellular processes, such as MVB biogenesis, cytokinesis and HIV virion budding as well as the spherule formation during the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, are based on topologically similar membrane invaginations (membrane deformation occurring away from the cytosol). Co-opting ESCRT proteins for these processes could be critical, since Snf7p and other ESCRT-III proteins have been shown to be involved in membrane deformation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> as well <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, the interaction of HIV gag protein, Cep55 midbody protein and the tombusvirus p33 replication protein with members of the endosomal pathway shows close parallel and mechanistic similarities, albeit the ESCRT proteins would be used for different processes, such as either virus budding, cytokenesis or viral RNA replication.</p><p>Another novel feature is that Vps23p, in the presence of p33 replication co-factor, is shown to re-localize temporarily to the peroxisomal membrane, which represents the place of tombusvirus replicase assembly <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Jonczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Panavas3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-McCartney1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). After brief recruitment, Vps23p seems to be released from the replicase, because we did not find Vps23p in the highly-purified functional replicase complex <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and it was not co-localized with a peroxisomal marker at latter time points after induction of p33 expression (not shown). The relatively weak interaction between Vps23p and p33 as well as the low percentage of ubiquitinated p33 <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> could be useful during virus replication to optimize the number of Vps23p recruited into each replicase complex. Indeed, based on replicases of other plus-strand RNA viruses <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Kopek1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, it is predicted that 100-to-200 p33 molecules are likely needed for the formation of a single replicase complex, whereas only a few Vps23p molecules should be recruited temporarily for each replicase complex. In addition, it is likely that Vsp23p and Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p could play complementary roles in recruiting additional ESCRT factors as shown in case of HIV gag for virion budding <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Weak interactions between Vps23p - p33 and Bro1p - p33 could help recycling these host proteins that should not be present in the fully assembled replicase complex <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. On the contrary, host factors that are permanent residents in the replicase, such as heat shock protein 70 (the yeast Ssa1p protein) <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Serva1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, bind more efficiently to p33 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g005">Fig. 5</xref>.</p><p>We propose that p33 - Vps23p interaction is important for the optimal assembly of the tombusvirus replicase, because the membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase preparation obtained from <italic>vps23&#x00394;</italic> yeast supported low TBSV repRNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Further support on the role of p33 - Vps23p interaction in replicase assembly comes from data obtained using a membrane-enriched fraction containing the viral replicase prepared from <italic>vps23&#x00394;</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The protection of the (-)repRNA associated with the replicase complex is likely due to the repRNA becoming inaccessible as part of the assembled replicase complex <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Pogany2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We found that the viral (&#x02212;)repRNA within the replicase complex obtained from <italic>vps23&#x00394;</italic> yeast was more sensitive to RNase treatment than the replicase preparation obtained from wt yeast. Thus, similar to <italic>vps24&#x00394;</italic> yeast discussed above, the viral replicase, which is located inside the spherules, assembles less precisely in <italic>vps23&#x00394;</italic> than in wt yeast. Overall, these data are compatible with the model that p33 - Vps23p interaction could be important during the replicase assembly process and/or affect the structure of the replicase complexes, which could determine the accessibility of the repRNA to RNases during replication. However, the effect of <italic>VPS23</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) or over-expression of a dominant negative mutant of Vps23 homologue in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) was not as detrimental to virus replication as deletion of ESCRT-III or <italic>VPS4</italic> in yeast or over-expression of dominant negative mutants of ESCRT-III or Vps4p homologues in plants. This could be due to the redundant roles likely played by Vps23p, Bro1p and possibly Rsp5p in recruitment of ESCRT-III/Vps4p factors, based on the similar redundancy documented for subversion of ESCRT-III/Vps4p by HIV gag's interaction with Tsg101/Alix/Nedd4 <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Usami1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Also, we do not know if the dominant negative mutants were able to block completely the function of every <italic>VPS23</italic> gene, since the number of <italic>VPS23</italic> genes is yet not known in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p><p>It is likely that the most important aspect of recruitment of Vps23p and Bro1p for tombusvirus replication is the possibility to co-opt additional ESCRT proteins, including the ESCRT-III factors and Vps4p. Accordingly, the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the tombusvirus replicase is 3-5-fold lower when obtained from plants expressing dominant negative ESCRT-III/Vps4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) or from <italic>vps24&#x00394;, snf7&#x00394;</italic>, or <italic>vps4&#x00394;</italic> yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Since the ESCRT-III factors are involved in grouping the cargo proteins together in the membrane and they have been shown to deform the membrane <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Malerod1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Saksena1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we propose that these proteins could be useful to affect the formation/structures of the spherules for virus RNA replication. Indeed, TBSV replication induces the formation of spherules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000705.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1000705-McCartney1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, which are topologically related to multivesicular bodies (MVB), since both require membrane invagination into the lumen, away from the cytosol. This is opposite to the regular intracellular vesicle formation, which buds into the cytosol. Collectively, usurping a partial set of ESCRT factors by tombusvirus replication proteins might facilitate the optimal formation of active viral replicase complexes within the membranous spherules. Moreover, recruitment of Vps4p AAA ATPase <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Morita1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000705-Babst1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, could help re-cycling of the ESCRT factors from the replicase after the assembly. Thus, it is possible that the expression of dominant negative mutants of Vps24p and Snf7p ESCRT-III or Vps4p factors inhibit tombusvirus replication in plants by interfering with the proper assembly of the replicase complex. Accordingly, the (&#x02212;)repRNA located within the viral replicase complex became more accessible to targeted ribonuclease cleavage when the replicase was assembled in the presence of dominant negative ESCRT-III mutants in plant leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p>Based on the data presented here, we propose that the ESCRT machinery is recruited for tombusvirus replication in a unique way. The first step in recruitment of Vps23p is the ubiquitination of small percentage of p33 (Ub-p33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000705-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, step 1) <xref rid="ppat.1000705-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Then, the ubiquitinated p33 (Ub-p33) binds to the adaptor protein Vps23p (step 2) or to Bro1p accessory ESCRT protein, followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7p and Vps24p. The ESCRT-III proteins could then help the optimal assembly of the replicase complex, facilitate the grouping of p33 molecules together in the membrane and/or promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membrane (membrane invagination) (step 3). Then, Doa4p deubiquitination enzyme is predicted to remove ubiquitin from Ub-p33, whereas Vps4p AAA ATPase could recycle the ESCRT proteins (step 4). Altogether, we suggest that these events could promote the optimal and precise assembly of the TBSV replicase complex, resulting in TBSV RNA replication, including (&#x02212;) and (&#x0002b;)RNA syntheses, in a protected microenvironment and then the regulated release of the progeny (&#x0002b;)RNAs into the cytosol. Importantly, the precisely assembled replicase complex provides protection from recognition by the host defense surveillance system and/or viral RNA destruction by the gene silencing/RNAi machinery. Similar events might also take place in case of other (&#x0002b;)RNA viruses, which are also known to deform membranes and/or form spherules during replication.</p><fig id="ppat-1000705-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000705.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>A model for the role ESCRT proteins in tombusvirus replication.</title><p>Recruitment of Vps23p and/or Bro1p to the peroxisomal membrane by a small fraction of p33 is suggested to lead to the recruitment of additional ESCRT factors.
