Persistent impairment of the upper extremity (UE) occurs in up to two-thirds of patients after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. UE paresis can lead to deficits in motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], motor dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and participation in activities of daily living (ADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Developing and providing effective therapeutic techniques to improve UE motor control and recovery is crucial.</p><p>Robot-assisted therapy (RT) is an emerging intervention approach that provides high-intensity, high-repetition, and task-specific training to enhance motor learning and control in patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Systemic reviews have indicated that RT improves UE muscle strength and motor function of patients with moderate to severe motor impairment after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent review suggested that the assessment of movement kinematics should be included in RT studies to identify modulation in motor control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous studies found that RT can improve motor control strategies in patients with stroke, including greater movement efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], better movement smoothness of the affected UE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and more use of the preplanned control strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, no consistent findings on patients&#x02019; participation in ADL were observed after RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. How to optimize or transfer the treatment benefits of RT on motor function and motor control strategies into participation in ADL warrants further investigation. An approach using RT monotherapy may not optimally address this need.</p><p>Constraint-induced therapy (CIT), one most investigated approaches to rehabilitation, was developed to overcome the learned nonuse phenomenon and enhance functional use of the affected arm after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Treatment components of CIT include repetitive and intensive task practice, behavioral shaping techniques, restraint of the unaffected UE, and transfer package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Modified and distributed CIT, which are not as intensive as the original CIT, have been developed and validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The benefits of the original CIT and its modified versions have been well demonstrated to improve motor function, arm-hand activities, and daily performance of patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Therapies that combine RT with other rehabilitation approaches have been developed to optimize the treatment effects of RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The combination of RT and conventional therapy led to significant gains in arm function of patients, but different combination sequences showed benefits in different outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, RT combined with repetitive task practice was effective in enhancing hand function and stroke recovery of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has investigated the treatment effects of sequencing the combination of RT and a modified form of CIT (mCIT) in patients with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The results indicated that the sequential combination of RT and mCIT led to better motor and functional ability measured by clinical scales compared with RT alone or conventional rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, whether the changes in motor control strategies are responsible for the improvements in motor function after the sequential combination therapy remains unclear.</p><p>Kinematic analysis has been recommended as a sound measure to provide objective and sensitive evaluations on spatial and temporal characteristics of UE movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More importantly, kinematics can capture motor control strategies that cannot be detected by clinical scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, kinematic analysis enables us to understand whether the behavioral improvement is due to a true change in the end point control and joint motion or is a result of compensation. Kinematic measures, along with clinical assessments, can better clarify the motor control strategies underlying the motor improvements of stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>This study investigated the effects of the sequential combination of RT and mCIT (RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT), compared with RT alone, focusing on motor control strategies measured by kinematic analysis and on motor and ADL functions using clinical measures. We hypothesized that (1) RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT would lead to different benefits on the motor control strategies compared with and RT alone and that (2) RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT would contribute to better performances in ADL than RT alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The data of the current study were derived from part of a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial designed to comprehensively examine the effects of RT alone and the combination of RT and mCIT in patients with stroke.

There were three computer-controlled modes. In the passive&#x02013;passive mode, the device passively moves both arms. In the active&#x02013;passive mode, the unaffected arm actively drives the affected arm to move passively. In the active&#x02013;active mode, the affected arm has to overcome the initial resistance to allow the arm movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Before RT, participants had 5 to 10&#x000a0;min of mobilization as a warm-up. Then, the RT protocol included 600 to 800 repetitions of the passive&#x02013;passive and active&#x02013;passive modes for 15 to 20&#x000a0;min and 150 to 200 repetitions of the active-active mode for 3 to 5&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While the patient&#x02019;s affected arm can actively perform the movements or as the patient improved, the active-passive mode was adjusted to the affected arm actively driving the unaffected arm to encourage more active movements of the affected arm. After RT training protocol, participants practiced functional-based activities for 15 to 20&#x000a0;min, such as picking up coins, opening a jar, turning pages of newspaper, carrying objects, and twisting a towel, which were selected by the patient and the therapist.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group</title><p>For the first 2&#x000a0;weeks, participants in RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group received RT, using the same treatment principles as those in the RT group.

Patients who received RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT or RT alone demonstrated different benefits on motor control strategies after treatment. Compared with the RT group, the RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group used less shoulder abduction, more elbow extension, and less trunk compensation movement, representing restoration of better motor control strategies. In contrast, the RT group showed significantly improved force generation at movement initiation than the RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group. The RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group achieved greater improvements than the RT group on movement quality of the affected limb (measured by the WMFT-FAS) and independence of instrumental ADL (measured by the NEADL). Better UE motor control strategies may contribute to the improvement of UE movement quality and participation in ADLs after RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Benefits of RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT in kinematics relative to RT</title><p>RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT led to better motor control strategies by reducing shoulder abduction, increasing elbow extension, and decreasing trunk compensatory movement during the reaching task than RT. Excessive shoulder abduction and trunk movement during reaching are common compensatory movements after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Our findings suggest that RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT may promote normalized movement at the shoulder, elbow, and trunk, which may decrease compensatory movement during the reaching task. The kinematics improvement may be associated with the improvement in endpoint coordinate control after RT, and the improvement became a preparation for subsequent mCIT, which continuously strengthen the joint angle coordinate through massed practice of the affected arm with purposeful functional activities training.</p><p>RT provides distal movement training with a constant velocity and a high repetition of passive or active movement, which may also help prevent inappropriate compensatory strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT induced significant improvement on the maximal angle of elbow extension. Previous studies of RT and CIT monotherapy demonstrated beneficial effects on motor control strategy based on kinematic data. Ellis et al. also found that reaching range of motion (including elbow extension) was improved after the intervention with the ACT<sup>3D</sup> robotic device in stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. They indicated that increased reaching ability may be attributed to the improvements in shoulder-elbow coordination or joint control after RT. In addition, previous CIT studies found that CIT induced feedforward control strategy (more preprogrammed movement) and better spatiotemporal control of movement resulting in improvements in shorter reaction and movement time, smoother trajectories, and better joint coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, CIT did not significantly improve the angle of elbow extension during reaching movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Extending the affected elbow when reaching outward is difficult for patients with stroke due to the strong synergistic joint torque coupling of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Encouragingly, our results showed that RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT increased elbow extension and reduced shoulder abduction and trunk compensatory movement during the reaching task. An interaction between RT and mCIT likely led to synergistic effects on joint angle coordinate strategies and trunk compensatory movement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Benefits of RT in kinematics relative to RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT</title><p>Our results showed that RT led to gains on endpoint coordinate strategy, as reflected by the Index PV variable during the reaching task, suggesting that RT generated more force at movement initiation than RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT. The results agree with previous studies that showed distal upper-limb RT had significant benefits on increasing muscle strength of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. These findings suggest that RT is crucial for enhancing force generation, which may lead to the superior effect on endpoint coordinate strategy of RT group in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Benefits of RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT in motor function and ADL as measured by clinical scales relative to RT</title><p>The RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group improved more on motor function measured by the WMFT-FAS than the RT group. This finding was similar to the results of a previous study that found greater motor improvement after RT in sequential combination with mCIT than a control therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group had greater improvement than the RT group in instrumental ADL function. The mean change score of the NEADL was 6.29 points, which exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (6.1 points) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The possible explanation is that the 2-week mCIT program the patients received focused on the repeated practice of functional tasks, which facilitated transferring the gains in motor performance to instrumental ADL. Further, the improvement of instrumental ADL after RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT may also transfer to the functional use of the affected arm in executing daily activities that can be detected by the Motor Activity Log [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Further research to incorporate the use of the Motor Activity Log to more comprehensively measure daily function of patients is suggested.</p><p>No significant group differences were noted in basic ADL function, possibly because there may be an approaching ceiling effect on the total score of FIM in the current study, which did not leave much room for improvement. Our participants were also in the chronic phase of stroke, a phase in which basic ADL functions tend to be stable. In addition, some strategies of CIT transfer package, such as home skill assignment and home practice, were not applied in this study. Transfer package is a set of strategies to facilitate the transfer of CIT treatment gains to real-life activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Studies showed that larger improvements with long-term effects occurred in the CIT groups that received transfer package compared with groups that did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Further investigation that includes whole strategies of transfer package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] may demonstrate greater differences in daily performance between groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study limitations</title><p>One potential confounding factor was that the baseline NEADL score in the RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group was significantly lower than in the RT group. Although the improved score of the RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT group on the NEADL was significantly higher than the RT group, caution is needed in interpreting the results.</p><p>Secondly, the lack of a follow-up assessment might limit the understanding of potential long-term effects of combined rehabilitation therapy. Future research should examine the retention effects of therapeutic gains on motor control mechanisms in patients with stroke after combined interventions.</p><p>Third, further research with a larger sample size is suggested to apply principal component analysis to help identify the critical components that can represent various kinematic variables and to avoid multiple comparisons of kinematic variables. Use of the ISB standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] is suggested for defining joint coordinate systems when reporting kinematic data, which can enhance communication among clinicians and researchers.</p><p>In addition, the robot-assisted device used in this study provided training of wrist and forearm movements only. Further studies to investigate the effects of RT focus on the proximal versus distal portion of the UE on motor control strategies are suggested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that patients who received RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT and RT alone had different aspects of benefits on motor control strategies. RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT uniquely improved motor control strategies of the affected limb and enhanced independence in instrumental ADL. RT improved force generation at movement initiation. A combination of RT and mCIT contributes to improve motor control strategies, motor function, and functional independence of instrumental ADL for patients with stroke.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Dist</term><def><p>movement distance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p>functional ability score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIM</term><def><p>Functional Independence Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMA</term><def><p>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MaxElbExt</term><def><p>the maximal angle of elbow extension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MaxShAbd</term><def><p>the maximal shoulder abduction in the frontal plane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MaxShFlex</term><def><p>the maximal angle of shoulder flexion in the sagittal plane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mCIT</term><def><p>a modified form of constraint-induced therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MT</term><def><p>movement time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEADL</term><def><p>Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPV</term><def><p>percentage of movement time at which peak velocity occurs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PV</term><def><p>peak velocity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>robot-assisted therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;mCIT</term><def><p>sequential combination of robot-assisted therapy and a modified form of constraint-induced therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UE</term><def><p>upper extremity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WMFT</term><def><p>Wolf Motor Function Test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare no competing interests related to this study.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>YWH, CYW, and KCL contributed to the study design, coordination, and project management.
