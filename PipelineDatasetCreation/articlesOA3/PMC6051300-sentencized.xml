<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With the population growth and aging, the global burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is high [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>How to repair traumatic myocardium, reverse ventricle remodeling, and improve heart function after myocardial infarction (MI) are the main problems facing clinicians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>IHD causes cardiomyocyte necrosis and apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which is frequently seen in the border zone of ischemic tissue after MI, can lead to cardiomyocyte loss [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The regenerated cardiomyocytes are insufficient to replenish the lost myocytes, so in the border zone of ischemic tissue after MI, even relatively low levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis have profound effects on cardiac remodeling and function [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and its family member bax are two upstream regulators of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 is known to be an antiapoptotic factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Overexpressed bcl-2 protects cardiomyocyte viability and left ventricle function in IHD, whereas bax counteracts the antiapoptotic functions of bcl-2 [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A number of signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that governs cell fate specification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Activation of the Notch signaling pathway exhibits an improved hemodynamic function and reduced myocardial fibrosis after MI [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>And there are many articles pointing that the Notch signaling pathway, especially activation Notch 1 receptor, protects cardiomyocyte apoptosis in several pathophysiological conditions, including hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion, high glucose, burn, or lipopolysaccharide induced myocardial injury [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Notch signaling includes a RBP-J-dependent pathway called canonical Notch signaling and a RBP-J-independent pathway called noncanonical Notch signaling [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Most studies elucidated the cardioprotective effects of the Notch signaling pathway by activating or silencing individual Notch receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the role of RBP-J-mediated canonical Notch signaling pathway in cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recombination signal-binding protein-J (RBP-J) is a DNA-binding protein and a key transcription factor downstream of receptor activation in the canonical Notch signaling pathway, but no Notch-independent functions of RBP-J have been described in the mammalian system [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, knockout of RBP-J essentially generates a specific blockade of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in other tissues, RBP-J knockout inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited a reduction in the levels of bcl-2 and an upregulation of the expression of bax [16–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our study supposes that, in adults, the RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling may reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI by regulating bcl-2/bax. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This study produced that genetic blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway receded the protective effect brought by activation of Notch 1 receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>And this result was related to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the RBP-J deficient mice after MI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanism is involved in the modulation of an increased expression of bax and a decreased expression of bcl-2 after blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that endogenous RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling is critical for ischemia-induced myocardial injury, and this signaling pathway may serve as a therapeutic target. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Notch signaling is highly related to cardioprotective effects after myocardial injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Previous studies found that Notch 1 was activated in myocardial injury [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>And this result is similar to our study in which Notch 1 receptor was activated after MI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>A recent study indicated that activation of Notch 1 limits the extent of ischemic damage, reduces myocardial fibrosis, and improves heart function [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In systemic Notch 1 deficient mice, myocardial infarction leads to the development of a larger myocardial infarct area and worsening of heart function than wild-type controls [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These results all manifested activation Notch 1 receptor has a protective effect after ischemia-induced myocardial injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>RBP-J is a key transcription factor downstream of receptor activation in the canonical Notch signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In the present study, blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch pathway led to deterioration of heart function, increased collagen deposition, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>These results indicated blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway receded the protective effect brought by activation of Notch 1 receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Apoptosis is uncommon in a normal heart but is a frequent process in cardiac remodeling, particularly in IHD [26–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>And studies have shown that, in other tissues, the deletion of RBP-J is related to cell apoptosis [17, 29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In our study, we observed that blocking the canonical Notch signaling pathway by RBP-J knockout could increase cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the border zone of ischemic heart tissue following MI, which suggested that one cardioprotective effect brought by activation RBP-J-mediated Notch pathway is involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>With increasing incidence in recent years, the mitochondria are vulnerable to damage in response to ischemia/hypoxia, leading to excessive oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes [10, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 and bax are two crucial mediators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 protein is a membrane protein and is mainly localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of Bcl-2 inhibition of apoptosis may include (1) direct antioxidation; (2) inhibition of mitochondria release of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome C; (3) inhibition of cytotoxicity of bax; (4) inhibition of caspase activation [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, bax initiates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by triggering the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity, which releases cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm, activating caspase-9 and in turn, its downstream caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated that activation of Notch signaling pathway may have a role in protecting cardiomyocyte from apoptosis, and the potential mechanism may be related to the regulation of bcl-2 and bax [36], reduction of oxidative stress [11], and activation of other protective signaling pathway [29, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that the cardiomyocyte-specific blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway after MI may involve the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, specifically bcl-2 and bax. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>And our research indicated that increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by blockade of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway after MI may be related to the imbalance of bcl-2 and bax expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we thought RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling is capable of inhibiting the apoptosis-inducing effects of myocardial infarction, possibly through the regulation of bcl-2 family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>This effect was further reinforced by studies demonstrating that constitutively active Notch receptor or RBP-J modulates the expression of bcl-2 [16, 18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we used genetic knockout of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling pathway to demonstrate the roles of RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling in ischemia-induced myocardial injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling also protects against ischemia-induced myocardial injury through the modulation of the expression of bax and bcl-2, which activates caspase 3 expression and leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest new therapeutic targets to limit ischemia-induced myocardial injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed underlying mechanism of the regulation of bcl-2 family members by the canonical Notch signaling requires further investigation in future studies. </plain></SENT>
