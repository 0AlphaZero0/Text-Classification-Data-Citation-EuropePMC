Cerebral malaria (CM) is a catastrophic sequel of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria, with a mortality rate of approximately 20% [<xref rid="OFV111C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], causing long-term neurological defects in 10% to 24% of survivors [<xref rid="OFV111C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most effective antiparasitic therapy is intravenous (IV) artesunate, which reduced mortality from 21% to 18% in African children with CM [<xref rid="OFV111C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several adjunctive therapies have been tested, but none have proven to be effective [<xref rid="OFV111C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intercellular messenger molecule synthesized by various cell types, including vascular endothelial cells. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation, among numerous other effects [<xref rid="OFV111C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Malaria severity was correlated with reduced levels of biochemical markers of NO production [<xref rid="OFV111C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Physiological markers of reduced NO bioavailability&#x02014;reduced brachial artery postischemic vasodilation [<xref rid="OFV111C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and increased pulmonary arterial pressures [<xref rid="OFV111C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]&#x02014;were correlated with increased cell-free hemoglobin levels in patients with severe malaria, reflecting the NO-scavenging property of cell-free hemoglobin.</p><p>Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and its antagonist Ang-2 regulate endothelial activation, and serum, plasma, or whole blood levels have been studied as biomarkers of CM severity and disease progression. Angiopoietin-1 levels were reduced and Ang-2 levels were elevated in pediatric CM patients compared with healthy children [<xref rid="OFV111C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and uncomplicated malaria patients [<xref rid="OFV111C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Significantly elevated levels of Ang-2 were found in fatal cases of CM and severe malaria [<xref rid="OFV111C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Breathing low concentrations of NO gas reduces pulmonary arterial pressures without producing systemic hypotension in animal models and children [<xref rid="OFV111C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and inhaled NO has been safely used to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension and other pulmonary disorders [<xref rid="OFV111C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in neonates and infants for over 20 years [<xref rid="OFV111C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA)-infected mice (a murine CM model), breathing 40 or 80 parts per million (ppm) of inhaled NO [<xref rid="OFV111C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] improved survival rates, reduced plasma inflammatory markers, and increased plasma Ang-1 levels. In other studies, inhaled NO reduced cerebral injury in murine models of stroke [<xref rid="OFV111C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="OFV111C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Based on the well established clinical safety profile of inhaled NO and its efficacy in experimental models of CM, we conducted an open-label randomized trial of breathing 80 ppm NO versus nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as an adjunctive therapy to IV artesunate in pediatric CM patients in Uganda. The primary endpoint was to compare the increase of plasma Ang-1 levels over the first 48 hours of treatment in patients breathing either NO or N<sub>2</sub>. Nitric oxide delivery and safety were monitored and assessed by measuring methemoglobin% (metHb%) and NO metabolites. Although the study was too small to detect significant changes, in-hospital mortality, time to recovery from coma, and neurologic sequelae for up to 6 months after discharge were also determined.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>We screened children aged 2 months to 12 years, weighing 5&#x02013;20 kg, at the tertiary care Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) Pediatric Ward and the Holy Innocents Children's Hospital.

After consent was obtained, we randomized patients to either study arm using off-site computer-generated random allocation. Sealed envelopes contained the patient treatment designation and were opened after consent and enrollment.</p><p>Survival was defined as alive at the time of hospital discharge. Patients were examined for neurological sequelae at the time of discharge and at follow-up neurological assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Oversight</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association, and was approved by the institutional review boards of the following institutions: Massachusetts General Hospital, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, the Ugandan National Council for Science and Technology, the Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes France, and M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res International. The US Food and Drug Administration was notified, but an Investigational New Drug approval was not required. The Ugandan National Drug Authority approved the study. A data and safety monitoring board was convened biannually, for a total of 3 meetings, to review the unblinded safety data based on serious adverse events and mortality. The trial was registered under the ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01388842.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>The patient's vital signs and coma score were assessed and logged every 2 hours. Transcutaneous pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), methemoglobin (SpMET), hemoglobin levels, and pulse rate were continuously monitored noninvasively with a Radical 7 co-oximeter (Masimo, Irvine, CA). When elevated transcutaneous SpMET levels were detected, blood metHb% was measured with an Avox 4000 spectrophotometer (ITC, Cambridge, MA) for confirmation. Whole-blood hemoglobin (g/dL) levels were measured with a Hemo Control Hemoglobin Analyzer (EKF Diagnostics, Cardiff, UK). If the metHb% level was 8.5% or greater, the inhaled gas dose was reduced by 50% and then reduced by an additional 25% of the original dose if the metHb% did not decrease below 8.5% within 1&#x02013;2 hours.</p><p>Blood was sampled by venipuncture at enrollment (15 minutes before initiating study gas treatment, time 0) and at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after commencing treatment with study gas. Blood-based measurements included the following: hemoglobin, complete blood count, parasite smears, and plasma levels of creatinine, lactate, Ang-1 and Ang-2, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-&#x003b1;, interferon [IFN]-&#x003b3;, interleukin [IL]-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1), S100b, and NO metabolites (nitrate, nitrite, <italic>N</italic>-nitrosamines [RNNO], <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols [RSNO]). A total of 10 mL of blood was sampled for research analyses from each patient over the 5-day study period. See the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofv111/-/DC1">Supplement</ext-link> for a description of specific laboratory procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Gas Administration</title><p>Study gas was delivered to the patient via a nasal cannula with a metered dosing apparatus specifically developed for investigational use (INOPulse<sup>TM</sup>, Ikaria, Inc., NJ) [<xref rid="OFV111C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The gas volume, and thus the gas dose to be delivered, was determined with a nomogram, incorporating the child's weight (to estimate tidal volume) and respiratory rate (see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofv111/-/DC1">Supplement</ext-link> for further description). Because the INOPulse was limited to 10 mL of gas injection per breath, to avoid under-dosing NO gas we were restricted to enrolling children weighing less than 20 kg. Enrolled patients received study gas for a targeted minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 120 hours. All patients with a SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264; 94% were given supplemental oxygen by facemask.</p><p>If, during the course of treatment, a patient's respiratory rate (and therefore alveolar minute ventilation) changed, his/her INOPulse gas dose was adjusted using the nomogram. If the patient regained full consciousness (BCS 5/5 or GCS 15/15) and had received treatment gas for greater than 48 hours, or if the patient completed 120 hours of gas treatment regardless of clinical status, the treatment gas was reduced by 50% each hour until turned off.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Concomitant Treatment</title><p>Enrolled patients received IV artesunate per protocol for at least 48 hours and up to 5 days. Patients able to take oral medications were transitioned to a 3-day course of artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem; Novartis Pharma, Switzerland) after 48 hours of IV artesunate treatment (see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofv111/-/DC1">Supplement</ext-link> for additional treatments and interventions).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>The primary study endpoint was the increase of plasma Ang-1 levels at 48 hours. The secondary laboratory endpoints included reduction in plasma Ang-2, the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio, selected plasma cytokine levels and creatinine, and blood lactate. The Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio was calculated for each patient, and the mean of these ratios is reported. Additional secondary endpoints included mortality during hospitalization, time taken to recover from coma, and neurological sequelae occurring up to 6 months after discharge. We evaluated the safety of NO delivery, and we monitored metHb% and NO metabolites to confirm inhalation and uptake of NO.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We compared proportions with a &#x003c7;&#x000b2; or Fisher's exact test with 2-sided <italic>P</italic> values. We assessed data within groups using a 2-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, and we assessed data between groups using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Data between the N<sub>2</sub> and NO treatment cohorts, and within treatment cohorts at hours 0 and 48, were compared from patients who received gas for at least 48 hours and those for whom we had paired data. We compared survival and time to coma recovery curves using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves and log-rank test (or Wilcoxon Breslow when appropriate). Statistics and graphs were generated with Stata software (Release 13, StataCorp.) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.

The overall incidence rate of neurological sequelae in our study was 12%, which is similar to the 10%&#x02013;25% rate reported in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="OFV111C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We believe NO treatment to be safe because the mortality rate in our study was low, breathing NO did not increase the incidence of neurological sequelae, mean methemoglobin levels remained low (4.1% &#x000b1; 0.4%), and the number of patients affected by SAEs and AEs were similar in both groups.</p><p>Plasma S100b, a biomarker of injury to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and other neural cell types, is increased in patients after traumatic brain injury and cardiac arrest [<xref rid="OFV111C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV111C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Elevated S100b levels have been measured in adult and pediatric CM patients with seizures, but this was only investigated using cerebrospinal fluid [<xref rid="OFV111C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We measured plasma S100b levels in our CM patients, and, although we found no significant difference in the reduction of the levels between the treatment groups over 48 hours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="OFV111TB2">2</xref>), plasma S100b may be useful as a tool for assessing the level of central nervous system injury in future studies involving CM patients.</p><p>We delivered NO or N<sub>2</sub> with the INOPulse, a gas injector that was triggered on inspiration. Even though it was not possible to measure the precise NO concentration in the trachea of children receiving NO gas with the INOPulse, we confirmed that NO was inhaled by detecting elevated levels of blood metHb% and plasma NO metabolites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV111F2">2</xref>B and C). Similar observations were reported by Gladwin et al [<xref rid="OFV111C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], among adult sickle cell patients breathing 40 or 80 ppm NO using the INOPulse.</p><p>We measured plasma NO metabolites in an effort to better understand their changes in CM patients breathing NO, and we observed increased plasma nitrate levels in the NO arm and a reduction of nitrate levels in the N<sub>2</sub> arm after 48 hours of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV111F2">2</xref>C). After inhalation, NO has an extremely short half-life with 97% rapidly converted to nitrate and the remainder to stable adducts (<italic>S</italic>-nitrosylated proteins [eg, <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols or <italic>N</italic>-nitrosamines], nitrosyl-hemeproteins, and nitrite), which can release NO in systemic vascular beds by various mechanisms [<xref rid="OFV111C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Studies have shown beneficial extrapulmonary effects of inhaled NO in humans, including reduced platelet aggregation [<xref rid="OFV111C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], reduced myocardial injury after cardiopulmonary bypass [<xref rid="OFV111C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], increased renal blood flow [<xref rid="OFV111C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], enhanced liver allograft function in liver transplant recipients [<xref rid="OFV111C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and reduced inflammation in lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion from tourniquet use [<xref rid="OFV111C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Despite the possible vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory benefits of inhaled NO described above, including the positive outcomes of NO trials in murine models of CM [<xref rid="OFV111C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we did not find a significant difference in the change of plasma Ang-1 or Ang-2 levels after 48 hours of inhaled NO treatment. Plasma angiopoietin levels have been correlated to the severity of illness in severe malaria and CM patients [<xref rid="OFV111C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="OFV111C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the future, it may be valuable to focus the administration of inhaled NO upon CM patients with laboratory evidence of NO scavenging and pulmonary or systemic vasoconstriction. We would suggest studying the subset of CM patients with elevated levels of plasma cell-free hemoglobin and therefore increased NO scavenging and consumption [<xref rid="OFV111C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This subset has shown evidence of increased right heart/pulmonary pressures on echocardiogram [<xref rid="OFV111C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is also possible that this subset of patients suffer from increased cerebrovascular resistance with reduced cerebral blood flow. Breathing NO oxidizes cell-free hemoglobin to metHb, thereby reducing its ability to scavenge intrinsic NO [<xref rid="OFV111C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Inhaling NO may have greater clinical efficacy in this subgroup of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Treatment with NO did not significantly increase plasma Ang-1 levels at 48 hours compared with patients treated with N<sub>2</sub>. This small trial could not demonstrate a reduction of mortality or neurological impairment in children treated with NO. Seven patients in the N<sub>2</sub> group and 4 patients in the NO group died. A larger trial, utilizing measurements of cell-free hemoglobin and right heart pressures to assess pulmonary vasoconstriction, would be required to learn whether breathing NO could lead to improved survival rates in this subgroup of malaria patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ofid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofv111/-/DC1">Supplementary material</ext-link> is available online at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> (<uri xlink:href="http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/">http://OpenForumInfectiousDiseases.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).</p>
