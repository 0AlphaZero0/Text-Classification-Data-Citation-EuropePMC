</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Rose (Rosa spp.) is one of the most important and widely grown ornamental plants in the world [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that rose can be efficiently regenerated through organogenesis from various explants, such as leaves, roots, internodes, petioles and immature seeds, which is a prerequisite for plant reproduction and genetic engineering [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence has demonstrated that a precise balance of exogenous hormones is required for the organogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We previously established that a certain concentration of auxin is essential for the formation of the root-like organs named rhizoids from leaf explants in Rosa canina [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, the role of cytokinin in this process has not been characterized. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that were first identified by their role, in concert with auxin, in the control of cell division in cultured plant cells [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>While besides their ability to stimulate cell division, cytokinin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development, including embryo and seed development [10], [11], shoot initiation [12], leaf senescence [13], vascular differentiation [14] and response to biotic and abiotic stresses [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Because of the biological and agricultural importance of cytokinin [17], [18], it is important to understand the basic mechanism by which they regulate such diverse processes in plant cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in characterizing the cytokinin signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis, including the identification of the genes encoding the proteins controlling the key steps in cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Cytokinin signal transduction is based on the two-component phosphorelay signal transduction pathway which mainly includes Histidine Kinases (HKs), Histidine Phosphotransfer Proteins (HPs) and Response Regulators (RRs) [22], [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, response regulators (ARRs) fall into four main groups on the basis of their sequence similarities, domain structure and transcriptional response to cytokinin, including type-A ARRs, type-B ARRs, type-C ARRs and Arabidopsis pseudo-response regulators (APRRs) [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Type-A ARRs have a short C-terminal sequence, but lack the DNA-binding domain named GARP [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In contrast to type-A ARRs, type-B ARRs contain a receiver domain and a long C-terminal extension carrying a DNA-binding domain that is responsible for the regulation of transcription of cytokinin-related genes [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Type-C ARRs share less sequence similarity to type-A and type-B ARRs; they do not contain DNA-binding domains and are not transcriptionally regulated by cytokinin [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The APRRs lack the conserved residues for phosphorylation and are involved in modulating circadian rhythms [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the response regulators have not been characterized in ornamental plants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that cytokinin treatment significantly reduced callus activity and rhizoid formation in Rosa canina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified a type-A response regulator homologous gene, RcRR1, and found that its expression was rapidly induced by cytokinin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Importantly, RcRR1 overexpression Arabidopsis plants showed reduced sensitivity to cytokinin and altered auxin distribution and PIN genes expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of cytokinin signaling in regulation of organogenesis in Rosa canina. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure S1, leaf explants of Rosa canina were cultivated in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing cytokinin and auxin in various concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The rhizoids could be induced with appropriate auxin concentration even without exogenous cytokinin, while at high levels of auxin, the ability of rhizoid formation decreased (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>However, we observed a decreased ability of leaf explants to form rhizoids even at low cytokinin levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>With the increasing of cytokinin concentration in the medium, the callus became yellow and gradually disorganized with rare distinguishable root-like structures (Figure 1A and 1B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Rapid and efficient regeneration of rose in vitro is very important for rose reproduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>We have reported a new way of plant regeneration via protocorm-like bodies (PLBs), which were induced from rhizoids developed from leaf explants of Rosa canina [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>It is well known that in vitro plant regeneration via embryogenesis or organogenesis is dependent on the hormone composition of the culture medium [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Although it has been proved that auxin is essential for rhizoid initiation, the role of cytokinin in this process remained unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the phytohormone cytokinin modulates multiple plant developmental processes, including cell division and differentiation [35], [36], apical dominance [37], [38] and light responses [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that cytokinin treatment alone was unable to trigger any organogenic response but reduced callus activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cytokinin significantly inhibited the auxin-induced rhizoid formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Yet, we can’t explain the precise mechanism of the link between callus activity and rhizoid output. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The most probable explanation is that cytokinin treatment changed hormone balance in callus cells, reduced callus activity and ultimately inhibited rhizoid formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cytokinin is a key regulator of rhizoid development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Type-A ARRs have been shown to participate in various cytokinin-related plant growth and development processes [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, ARR4 overexpression confers hypersensitivity to red light, indicating a role in light-regulated development [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of a rice type-A ARR gene also results in hyposensitivity to cytokinin in callus formation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we isolated a putative response regulator gene named RcRR1 and found that the deduced amino acid sequence of RcRR1 showed high similarity to the type-A ARRs in plants and contained the conserved DDK domain indicating that RcRR1 belonged to the type-A ARRs subfamily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis further showed that the response regulator genes were distributed in a wide range of plants including dicots, monocots and gymnosperms, indicating their important function in various species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, transcription of most of the type-A ARRs has been detected in all adult organs, and the highest levels are found in the root [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that RcRR1 was also mainly expressed in the root, followed by the stem and leaves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>This high expression of RcRR1 in the root indicates that it may have a function during root-organ formation; moreover, there was a high expression level of RcRR1 at an early stage of callus formation, which was closely correlated with the rhizoid formation process, suggesting that RcRR1 is involved in rhizoid organogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The expression of some type-A ARRs genes is regulated by various environmental stresses, nitrogen levels and phosphate starvation [45], [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that cytokinin substantially increased the transcript level of RcRR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The up-regulating effect of cytokinin on RcRR1 expression was observed after short-term treatment, suggesting that RcRR1 expression can be rapidly regulated by cytokinin, which is consistent with the results in Arabidopsis, M. truncatula, and P. trichocarpa. Additionally, the development of primary and lateral roots of RcRR1 overexpression transgenic Arabidopsis showed reduced sensitivity to cytokinin, further demonstrating that RcRR1 is a functional negative response regulator of cytokinin signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The interaction between auxin and cytokinin in plant organogenesis has been well-established [48], [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism of their interaction in controlling plant organogenesis remains uncharacterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Pernisová et al. found that cytokinin modulates auxin-induced root-like organs in Arabidopsis via regulation of the auxin efflux [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>PIN1, PIN3 and PIN7 have been identified as the principal root-specific auxin efﬂux carriers controlling the auxin distribution during root development [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>We found that the expression pattern of DR5 was dramatically changed in the primary root tip and lateral roots of the RcRR1-OX plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the expression of PIN1, PIN3 and PIN7 genes was down-regulated in RcRR1-OX Arabidopsis as compared with the wild type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of the putative auxin efflux carrier gene in Rosa canina was decreased under cytokinin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that cytokinin might be associated with the auxin signaling in controlling rhizoid organogenesis via RcRR1 in Rosa canina. </plain></SENT>
