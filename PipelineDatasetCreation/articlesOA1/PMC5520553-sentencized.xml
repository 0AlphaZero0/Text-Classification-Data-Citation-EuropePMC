</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks fifth among all the malignancies and third among cancer deaths worldwide.[1] Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) increases survival in HCC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, immune suppressants are required in appropriate amounts to prevent transplant rejection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus, which is the first-line immunosuppressant after organ transplantation, reduces the incidence of rejection and improves graft and recipient survival.[2] Merely, tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic interval, with varying pharmacokinetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Standard doses of tacrolimus administered postoperatively are not effective in all patients equally.[3] Therefore, tacrolimus treatment requires monitoring for efficacy and safety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is a challenge to tailor individualized interventions during early postoperative period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that some gene polymorphisms are associated with drug metabolism.[456] Pharmacogenomics focuses on the relationship between host genetics and drug metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies focused on pharmacogenomics regardless of pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Patients with HCC were treated with different therapeutic regimens, which are associated with complications and poor prognosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the identification of markers to facilitate individualized tacrolimus therapy, especially in patients with HCC undergoing transplantation, is imperative. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoenzymes.[7] A cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) gene variation involving an A-to-G transition at position rs776746 within intron 3 was significantly associated with CYP3A5 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus is poorly metabolized in CYP3A5 rs776746 GG carriers.[8] However, the effects of CYP3A5 rs776746 do not explain the total individual differences in tacrolimus metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional markers can play a role in individual variation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The complement system affects liver function and process of liver cirrhosis and eliminates virus-infected and cancer cells as well.[910] The sixth component of the complement system (C6) is involved in the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) with other components (C5–C9) following activation of the complement cascade.[11] The MAC was reported to mediate transplant rejection, C6 is an acute phase protein, which was studied in a rat heart transplantation model.[12] Interestingly, we demonstrated that patients with C6 rs9200 GA presented with HCC recurrence following OLT.[13] However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has yet found the association between C6 gene polymorphisms and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we initially hypothesized that C6 gene polymorphisms might regulate MAC function and mediate tacrolimus metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This study was to investigate the association between tacrolimus metabolism and C6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large cohort of patients undergoing OLT for HCC and to evaluate the possible role of tacrolimus as an immunotherapeutic intervention tailored to individual patients during early postoperative period. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Drug resistance is a potentially fatal challenge post-OLT for HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenomics provides effective methods to investigate the mechanisms underlying interactive gene networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>An understanding of these interactions may contribute to the development of individualized drug therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>The risk of early organ rejection is the highest immediately posttransplantation.[15] Tacrolimus concentrations during the 1st week after transplantation determine the extent of rejection.[16] Therefore, the identification of key predictors of tacrolimus concentrations in the early stage after liver transplantation is clinically valuable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenetic dose algorithms for tacrolimus based on genotypes and clinical variables may facilitate the development of stable therapeutic doses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>In the current study, researchers investigated the associations of CYP3A5, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-18 genetic polymorphisms with tacrolimus metabolism.[456] Based on our findings, we propose the existence of a gene interaction network that affects tacrolimus pharmacogenomics in patients with HCC after OLT. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the CYP system. CYP3A5 rs776746 allele A noncarriers produce a truncated, nonfunctional CYP3A5 enzyme due to a splicing defect; therefore, these noncarrier patients metabolize tacrolimus more slowly than carriers.[8] In the current study, the CYP3A5 rs776746 genotype in donors altered tacrolimus C/D ratios during the 4-week posttransplantation, which was consistent with earlier studies.[17] In contrast, in this study, the recipient CYP3A5 rs776746 genotype was found to influence tacrolimus levels only at weeks 1, which was consistent with a recent meta-analysis and systematic review.[18] In the final combination analysis, an additional Kruskal-Wallis test including CYP3A5 polymorphisms alone revealed significantly lower tacrolimus C/D ratios in patients with rapid-metabolizing genotypes at 4-week posttransplantation (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.004, P = 0.007, and P = 0.001, respectively, data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that CYP3A5 rs776746 polymorphisms play a key role in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics although donor CYP3A5 polymorphisms have a more significant influence.[19] A limited number of clinical markers have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.[20] However, these markers or genetic polymorphisms do not account for all the observed variations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in this study, variations in tacrolimus C/D ratios among individual patients were partially correlated with C6 polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Recipients of liver grafts are known to be at increased risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), immunological injury, and drug toxicity during the posttransplantation period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>The complement system includes a series of complex biochemical and immunological pathways that eliminate foreign components from an individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Complement mediates inflammation and injury after ischemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Complement inhibition, therefore, is a potential therapeutic strategy to reducing IRI.[21] MAC inhibition facilitates early complement activation triggering cytokine production and hepatocyte proliferation.[22] Wu et al.[12] reported that C6-deficiency inhibits a late step in complement activation resulting in delayed xenograft rejection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, C6-deficiency in rats ameliorates IRI.[23] Activation of the complement system triggers apoptosis and opsonization.[24] However, complement activation also mediates liver regeneration.[25] Thus, the MAC can induce transplant rejection and also accelerates the restoration of liver function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>The complement system is involved in several cytolytic activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Surface expression of complement regulatory proteins (CRP) prevents cytolysis of cancer cells.[26] As well, cancers such as HCC overexpress CRPs including CD46 and CD59.[27] Increased CD46 expression in HCC represents an early step in disease progression.[28] Interestingly, upregulation of CD46, which is the cellular receptor for adenovirus type 35, may enhance the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses in HCC cells.[29] Tumor cells resist complement-mediated death through different mechanisms,[3031] specifically, reduction of C6 and C7 expression levels in tumor tissues have been reported to enhance the capacity of tumors to escape complement-dependent cytotoxicity.[32] Otherwise, the MAC assembly by C6 and other complement components[33] induces cell lysis by generating pores in the cell membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Several human neoplasias are associated with genes located on chromosome 5,[343536] and genes for C6 and C7 are closely linked on 5pl3.[11] In this study, the recipient C6 rs9200 allele G and donor C6 rs10052999 homozygote were linked with rapid tacrolimus metabolism after OLT in patients with HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Hence, C6 may play a decisive role in hepatocyte function in patients with HCC undergoing OLT. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Complement mediates hepatic injury and regeneration, as well as cancer immune surveillance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Antibody and complement play a key role in allograft rejection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, complement activation products, including C6, play a critical role in inflammatory reactions, allograft rejection, and IRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicated that both donor and recipient C6 might be closely related to tacrolimus metabolism after OLT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Liver is the primary site of C6 synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>In rats, extrahepatic synthesis of C6 has been reported during transplantation of livers from C6-deficient donors to normal recipients.[373839] Therefore, according to the results of this study, we speculated that extrahepatic sites of C6 biosynthesis play a key role in tacrolimus metabolism immediately after OLT, and C6 biosynthesis in hepatocytes is restored after liver function recovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggested that reduced complement activity resulted from genetic variations in C6.[40] Further, a CAAT/enhancer binding protein site in the C6 promoter has been found to be essential for normal C6 expression.[41] Thus, C6 SNPs can regulate C6 synthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>In this study, C6 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms were further analyzed in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>As shown in Table 4, the determination coefficients were 0.385, 0.057, 0.126, and 0.223 for the C/D ratios, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>It indicated that those regression models were bringing a discontent explanatory power, which just showed that amounts of genetic polymorphisms account for the C/D ratios were not in the models, and the individual differences of tacrolimus metabolism could be related to others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>As such, studies in larger cohorts of patients with some more related genetic polymorphisms are required in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The limitations of this study were as follows: First, the relatively small sample size comprising Chinese Han population precluded generalization of the results to different ethnic populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Second, the complement system is a complex network, and the relationships between C6 gene polymorphisms, C6 expression, and MAC activity require validation in further studies involving larger liver transplant cohorts of patients with HCC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with OLT for HCC require different therapeutic regimens compared with patients with etiologically distinct liver disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Specifically, this study found that recipient C6 rs9200 allele G was associated with rapid tacrolimus metabolism during the first 3 weeks after transplantation, and donor C6 rs10052999 homozygote represented a marker for rapid tacrolimus metabolism at weeks 2, 3, and 4 after OLT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Further, this study confirmed the association of CYP3A5 rs776746 SNPs with tacrolimus C/D ratios. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>The combination of C6 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms exerted a greater effect on tacrolimus metabolism than individual SNPs and developed better equations that described the association between genotype and tacrolimus metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>The findings facilitated the design of appropriate and safe therapeutic regimens for the management of patients with OLT for HCC. </plain></SENT>
