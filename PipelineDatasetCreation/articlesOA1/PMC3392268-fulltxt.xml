We used a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to evaluate global effects of simvastatin on intermediary metabolism. Analyses were conducted in 148 participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics study who were profiled pre and six weeks post treatment with 40 mg/day simvastatin: 100 randomly selected from the full range of the LDL-C response distribution and 24 each from the top and bottom 10&#x00025; of this distribution (&#x0201c;good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; responders, respectively). The metabolic signature of drug exposure in the full range of responders included essential amino acids, lauric acid (p&#x0003c;0.0055, q&#x0003c;0.055), and alpha-tocopherol (p&#x0003c;0.0003, q&#x0003c;0.017). Using the HumanCyc database and pathway enrichment analysis, we observed that the metabolites of drug exposure were enriched for the pathway class amino acid degradation (p&#x0003c;0.0032). Metabolites whose change correlated with LDL-C lowering response to simvastatin in the full range responders included cystine, urea cycle intermediates, and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, citrulline and lysine. These dibasic amino acids share plasma membrane transporters with arginine, the rate-limiting substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a critical mediator of cardiovascular health. Baseline metabolic profiles of the good and poor responders were analyzed by orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis so as to determine the metabolites that best separated the two response groups and could be predictive of LDL-C response. Among these were xanthine, 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, succinic acid, stearic acid, and fructose. Together, the findings from this study indicate that clusters of metabolites involved in multiple pathways not directly connected with cholesterol metabolism may play a role in modulating the response to simvastatin treatment.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00451828?term=Cholesterol&#x0002b;and&#x0002b;Pharmacogenetics&#x0002b;study&#x0002b;%28CAP%29&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00451828</ext-link>

However, this class of drugs exhibits a broad spectrum of biological effects that may impact on CVD risk, including improvement of endothelial function by upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), decrease in proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, reduction of platelet activity, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects <xref rid="pone.0038386-Jasinska1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition several clinically significant side effects have been documented, including myopathy and increased risk for developing Type II diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0038386-Ridker1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Multiple intervention trials with statin drugs have demonstrated a reduction in relative risk for both CVD and stroke. Nevertheless, residual CVD risk remains high and LDL-C response varies greatly. Variation in response to statins can be affected by genetic and environmental influences. Several genetic polymorphisms that contribute to variability in the LDL-C response to statins have been identified <xref rid="pone.0038386-Mangravite1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but only a small proportion of the variance has been explained by these factors. Additional variables affecting response to statins include diet <xref rid="pone.0038386-Vaquero1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, level of immune response <xref rid="pone.0038386-Ridker2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, environmental conditions, and drug interactions <xref rid="pone.0038386-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Simvastatin is administered as an inactive precursor drug that is activated by endogenous biotransformation pathways. There is increasing interest in the role of gut bacteria in the metabolism of drugs <xref rid="pone.0038386-Clayton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and recent data suggest that secondary bile acids produced by gut microbiome contribute to variation of LDL lowering response to simvastatin <xref rid="pone.0038386-KaddurahDaouk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Inter-individual variation in response to statins, and the fact that LDL cholesterol and other biomarkers are not sufficient to predict clinical benefit or side effects, suggest that more reliable biomarkers are needed for identifying the sub-populations that may achieve the most benefit from statin use and those that might be at risk for developing side effects. Metabolomics provides powerful tools for mapping pathways implicated in disease and in response to drug treatment <xref rid="pone.0038386-KaddurahDaouk2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-KaddurahDaouk3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Changes in levels of these three metabolites were significantly correlated with each other in samples from individuals across the full range of simvastatin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Changes in cholesterol and lauric acid levels were positively correlated with changes in levels of 2-hydroxyvaleric acid (p&#x0003c;0.0039, q&#x0003c;0.055) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Specifically, increases in cystine (p&#x0003c;0.0012, q&#x0003c;0.10), ornithine (p&#x0003c;0.0068, q&#x0003c;0.26), lysine (p&#x0003c;0.0100, q&#x0003c;0.26), and citrulline (p&#x0003c;0.0160, q&#x0003c;0.26) were all observed to correlate with the LDL-C lowering effects of simvastatin with significant p-values (&#x0003c;0.05), but high q-values. Individually, these metabolites are not considered statistically significant, but considering the close structural and functional similarities between the first six metabolites correlated to response to simvastatin&#x02013;we consider this finding compelling from a discovery perspective. Cystine, ornithine, and lysine, the three most significantly correlated metabolites, are all substrates for the cystinuria-related transporter rBAT/B (0, &#x0002b;) AT (SLC3A1/SLC7A9), which mediates uptake of dibasic amino acids at the intestinal and renal membranes. Citrulline and ornithine are also both intermediates in the catabolism of amino acids by the urea cycle and their strong correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggests an increased flux through the urea cycle and amino acid catabolism.</p><fig id="pone-0038386-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038386.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Correlation matrix illustrating two clusters of compounds correlated with simvastatin response in full range participants.</title><p>The two clusters were identified in a clustering analysis for the change of all metabolites (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> not shown) according to their pairwise correlations using the MMC algorithm <xref rid="pone.0038386-Yao2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>).

An untargeted metabolomics approach can yield many unrelated findings; but the dataset reported here has some striking patterns. In broadly sampled full range responders, we have detected an increase in amino acids, specifically essential amino acids and their degradation products. An increase in dibasic amino acids was correlated with response to simvastatin, again not a random set of amino acids, but specifically those transported by the cystinuria and arginine transporters. In poor responders we detected a decrease in plasma fructose, glucose and sugar acids that was not seen in good responders. This combination of findings may suggest a distinct pattern of energy usage between poor responders and the broader spectrum of response phenotypes. Poor responders could also be separated from good responders using an OPLS-DA model of baseline metabolites. Together these findings suggest that metabolomics analysis might be developed for defining a population unlikely to benefit from statin use sufficient to warrant risk of the spectrum of side-effects.</p><p>A more detailed analysis of the GC-TOF data reveals changes in a diverse set of compounds, some anticipated and some unexpected. The expected changes included decreased free cholesterol in individuals selected from both the full range of LDL-C response (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t001">Table 1</xref>) and those selected from the 10&#x00025; tail of good responders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038386.s002">Table S2</xref>), but not from the poor response tail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t003">Table 3</xref>). The very strong correlation of cholesterol with alpha and gamma tocopherol (vitamin E) may reflect the close relationship between tocopherols and cholesterol metabolism. In addition to their antioxidant effects, alpha tocopherol modulates LDL receptor concentrations, and reduces CD36 receptor and ABC1 transporter expression <xref rid="pone.0038386-Pal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Rode1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Devaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Ricciarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Simvastatin has been shown previously to reduce alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma following both short-term <xref rid="pone.0038386-Human1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and long-term exposure <xref rid="pone.0038386-Vasankari1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In studies where simvastatin treatment was augmented with alpha-tocopherol, increased lowering of total and LDL cholesterol was observed <xref rid="pone.0038386-Neunteufl1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, indicating that lower alpha-tocopherol levels are not mediating the LDL-C reductions. It has been reported that simvastatin treatment increases the capacity of LDL particles to transport lipid soluble antioxidants <xref rid="pone.0038386-Vasankari1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and oxygenated and hydrocarbon carotenoids <xref rid="pone.0038386-Ryden1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, suggesting that the statin-induced reductions in total plasma levels of tocopherol which we observed are accompanied by increased tocopherol content of LDL particles, and hence the net result may contribute to greater resistance of these particles to oxidative stress, and hence to reduced atherogenic potential. Additional pleiotropic effects of simvastatin might include an up regulation of triacylglycerol lipase activity (EC# 3.1.1.3, LIPC) <xref rid="pone.0038386-PiorunskaStolzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This might explain the increase in plasma levels of glycerol that we detect in our analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The increase in creatinine and modulation of several amino acids with simvastatin treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t001">Table 1</xref>) was associated with strong correlations among those metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggesting that a common metabolic pathway was affected. We have also observed that levels of shikimic acid, an enterobacteria-derived precursor of aromatic- and indole-containing amino acids, are also altered by statin treatment in the good responders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038386.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Pseudouridine, the C-glycoside isomer of the RNA nucleotide uridine, is present in essentially all ribosomal RNAs and seems to be affected by simvastatin. In humans pseudouridine synthase converts uridine to pseudouridine, which is a dead-end metabolite and generally excreted in urine. An increased level of pseudouridine suggests a decrease in the rate of excretion, but together with a reduced level of uridine, a more likely scenario is an increase in the activity of pseudouridine synthase.</p><p>The inter-correlated changes in several amino acids and their degradation products and the correlation between changes in these amino acids and LDL-C change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g002">Figure 2</xref>) point to possibly important functions of amino acids in simvastatin mechanism of action. Our data indicate a statin-induced change in amino acid degradation or transport. Our pathway analysis indicates that metabolites that changed in the full range participants in response to simvastatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t001">Table 1</xref>) were enriched for the pathway class amino acid degradation. In the full range participants, metabolites that correlate with LDL-C response to simvastatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t002">Table 2</xref>) included dibasic amino acids that are substrates for the cystinuria-related transporter, potentially indicating changes in transport. In addition, the changes in citrulline and ornithine suggest an increased flux through the urea cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038386-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t002">Table 2</xref>) again pointing to a change in amino acid degradation. Since simvastatin treatment either has no effect or can improve kidney function <xref rid="pone.0038386-Baigent1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Huskey1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Namli1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> it is unlikely that the changes in amino acids were due to renal dysfunction.</p><p>The previously published identification of amino acid metabolism as a marker of changes in cholesterol metabolism is consistent with the development of peptide biomarkers of cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0038386-Keshishian1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, amino acids have been identified as predictors of the risk of developing diabetes and possibly contributing to changes in insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0038386-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Laferrere1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The metabolite most significantly different between good and poor responders at baseline was the purine metabolite xanthine, which is implicated in oxidative stress cascades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t004">Table 4</xref>). Xanthine is the final breakdown product of purine nucleotides and the immediate precursor of uric acid. Xanthine is the substrate of xanthine oxidase, which produces hydrogen peroxide and hence is implicated in mechanisms of oxidative stress. Since free radicals are known to decouple NOS enzymatic activity, a lower basal level of xanthine and purine degradation may yield an environment for more robust NOS signaling. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are an emerging treatment for cardiac ischemia <xref rid="pone.0038386-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038386-Pacher1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and xanthine oxidase has been considered as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0038386-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Together, these results suggest that we have identified a metabolite related to oxidative stress that is robustly correlated to LDL response to simvastatin. Furthermore, recent results indicate that hyperuricemia resulting from increased purine degradation attenuates NO production by inhibiting arginine transport at the NOS associated CAT-1 transporter <xref rid="pone.0038386-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It has not escaped our attention that statin effects on arginine transport function may contribute to therapeutic effects on endothelial function by increasing NOS activity.</p><p>Recent studies employing <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of intestinal bacteria to metabolize simvastatin have revealed a degradation of drug, producing a series of metabolites including and similar to 2-hydroxyvaleric acid (2-hydroxypentanoic acid) <xref rid="pone.0038386-Aura1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We detected 2-hydroxyvaleric acid as a significantly decreased metabolite following <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with simvastatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since this metabolite is present in simvastatin na&#x000ef;ve samples and is decreased by simvastatin treatment, it is possible that simvastatin, or a metabolite of simvastatin, inhibits an enzyme that produces 2-hydroxyvaleric acid. Conversely, low basal levels of 2-hydroxyvaleric acid exhibit a highly significant correlation to LDL-C reduction in good and poor responders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0038386-t004">Table 4</xref>). This suggests lower activity of a promiscuous enzyme that produces 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, and perhaps metabolizes simvastatin, might also result in lower rates of simvastatin degradation and differential pharmacokinetics. This observation, as well as those described for shikimic acid above, suggests that variation in gut microbiome activity can contribute to mechanism of variation in response to simvastatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038386.s002">Table S2</xref>). An influence of gut micoflora on simvastatin response was also suggested by our recent finding that several secondary bile acids derived from microbial metabolism are predictive of LDL-C response to simvastatin in the CAP study <xref rid="pone.0038386-KaddurahDaouk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This suggests that genetic, gut microbiome and environmental interactions might all contribute to mechanism of variation of response to simvastatin.</p><p>While we consider this study a discovery project to validate the experimental paradigm and elucidate pleiotropic features, the sample size is commensurate with other metabolomics studies. However, larger studies will be necessary to validate clinical utility&#x02013;which will ideally define pre-treatment metabolic signatures that are predictive of efficacy of simvastatin as well as other statins in reducing clinical cardiovascular events, as well as those that can identify individuals most likely to experience adverse effects of treatment. Further, by assessing such markers, the design of future clinical trials can be improved by excluding individuals who are least likely to derive clinical benefit. The observation that people selected from the ends (best and worst responders) are biochemically distinct suggests that metabolomics might be a powerful tool for sub classification of individuals as an important step in streamlining clinical trials and personalizing treatment. Finally, the application of both mass spectrometry and lipidomics platforms in the CAP study has demonstrated the value of this approach in mapping global metabolic effects of simvastatin and in highlighting the pathways that may modulate variation in its clinical efficacy and in its multiple biological effects. We have undertaken this systems biology approach to define pharmacometabolomic changes to generate hypotheses of pleiotropic mechanisms mediating simvastatin effects. These results suggest that functional studies are warranted into the interaction of simvastatin with endogenous and enterobiome metabolites at bile and amino acid transporters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Clinical Samples</title><p>Plasma samples were analyzed from participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study, a trial in which 944 Caucasian and African-American men and women with total cholesterol levels of 160&#x02013;400 mg/dL were treated with simvastatin at 40 mg per day for six weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038386.s001">Table S1</xref>). Information about the participants selected for this study has been published previously. Briefly, this study was designed to examine genetic and non-genetic factors affecting the response to simvastatin therapy in healthy, drug-na&#x000ef;ve patients <xref rid="pone.0038386-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Participants were followed for a total of 6 weeks on simvastatin therapy (40 mg at bedtime) and were seen at clinic visits conducted at two-week intervals. Blood specimens from each participant were obtained after an overnight fast at the screening visit, after a 2-week placebo run-in (enrollment visit), and following 4 and 6 weeks of simvastatin administration. Samples used in this study were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks of therapy. Medication compliance was assessed by pill count every two weeks and averaged over 95&#x00025;. Overall, treatment with simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 54 mg/dl and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dl. The magnitude of the lipid and lipoprotein responses, however, differed among participants according to a number of phenotypic and demographic characteristics <xref rid="pone.0038386-Rode1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Data on dietary intake was not collected, but subjects were instructed not to change their diet. No minors took part in this study. Approval for this study of the analyses of determinants of simvastatin response in the CAP study was granted by the Children's Hospital and Research Center Institutional Review Board, University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research, and University of California Los Angeles Office of the Human Research Protection Program and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Two subgroups of participants were selected: the first from the extreme range of response, &#x02018;good and poor responders&#x02019;, consisted of 24 individuals selected from the top 10&#x00025; of the LDL-C response distribution who were matched for body mass index, race, and gender to 24 individuals in the lowest 10&#x00025; of responders, with response to therapy defined as the percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline. The second set &#x02018;full range&#x02019; was 100 individuals randomly selected from the entire CAP study, excluding participants who had been selected for the extreme range group. These full range participants are representative of the population for age, race, gender, and BMI. On the other hand, the extreme range subset provides a means to explore the differences in metabolite profiles and predictors of the highest and lowest responses to drug therapy.

A clean-up step with acetonitrile/water (1&#x02236;1) removed membrane lipids and triglycerides and the supernatant was dried down again. Internal standards C8&#x02013;C30 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were added and the sample was derivatized by methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine and subsequently by N-methyl-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) (1 ml bottles, Sigma-Aldrich) for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons.</p><p>A Gerstel MPS2 automatic liner exchange system was used to inject 1 &#x000b5;l of sample at 50&#x000b0;C (ramped to 250&#x000b0;C) in splitless mode with 25 s splitless time. An Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Santa Clara CA) was used with a 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx5Sil-MS column with 0.25 &#x000b5;m 5&#x00025; diphenyl film and additional 10 m integrated guard column was used (Restek, Bellefonte PA). Chromatography was performed at constant flow of 1 ml/min ramping the oven temperature from 50&#x000b0;C for to 330&#x000b0;C with 22 min total run time. Mass spectrometry was done by a Leco Pegasus IV time of flight mass spectrometer with 280&#x000b0;C transfer line temperature, electron ionization at &#x02212;70 V and an ion source temperature of 250&#x000b0;C. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 85&#x02013;500 at 20 spectra s<sup>-1</sup> and 1750 V detector voltage.

For relationships between changes in metabolite and statin response of LDL-C, metabolite changes were defined as post-treatment level minus pre-treatment level. For the 100 randomly selected full range participants, metabolite changes were correlated with statin response of LDL-C by calculating their Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients with post-treatment level LDL-C, adjusting for pre-treatment level of LDL-C. The adjusted Spearman&#x02019;s correlation is equivalent to the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation between the residuals of the linear regression of the ranks of post-treatment level of LDL-C and the metabolite change on the ranks of pre-treatment level of LDL-C. To associate metabolite changes with statin response of LDL-C using good and poor responder data, the difference of metabolite changes between good responders and poor responders using the Wilcoxon rank sum test was tested. Those significant metabolites are the compounds whose change is associated with statin response of LDL-C.</p><p>For predicting response of LDL-C to simvastatin, baseline metabolite levels were correlated with statin response of LDL-C by calculating their Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients with post-treatment level of LDL-C, adjusting for pre-treatment level of LDL-C using the same aforementioned method. In order to associate metabolites at baseline to statin response in LDL-C using extreme subjects&#x02019; data, the difference in metabolites at baseline between good responders and poor responders was tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

The OPLSDA model was built on log-transformed and then normalized baseline concentration of metabolites. Normalization was performed by subtracting each metabolite by its sample mean and dividing that by its standard error. The software SIMCA-P&#x0002b; version 12.0 was used to perform the analysis. Two orthogonal components were included in the model. A variable importance (VIP) score is used to rank metabolites&#x02019; contribution in separating the two response groups. Prediction diagnostics were derived from 7-fold cross validation. Each fold contains balanced numbers of good and poor responders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0038386.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
