</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Medicinal mushrooms are viewed as a rich source of therapeutically useful biologically active agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There are approximately 700 species of higher basidiomycetes that have been found to possess significant pharmacological activities [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For several thousand years, Ganoderma lucidum (Ling-Zhi in Chinese and Reishi in Japanese) has been widely used in Asia as a home remedy to treat minor disorders and promote vitality and longevity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have revealed that the primary active ingredients of G. lucidum are polysaccharides and the secondary metabolites ganoderic acids (GAs) [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Most GAs have important medicinal value, such as the regulation of osteoclast genesis [5], the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis [3] and tumor growth [6], and protection of the liver [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, despite the important pharmacological potential of GAs, low GA yield from both field cultivation and fermentation limits its wide-spread use. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Many attempts have been made to increase GA biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Those works can be divided into two branches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most reports focus on the environmental conditions during fermentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The optimal medium (carbon source, nitrogen source, mineral source, and initial pH) was elucidated by an orthogonal design study that tested one factor at a time [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>By studying the effect of the fed-batch fermentation process (pH-shift and dissolved oxygen tension-shift) on the GA content, strategies were identified that resulted in a significant synergistic enhancement of GA accumulation [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, the use of an inducer to enhance the activity components in fungi fermentation has drawn great interest [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For GA production, methyl jasmonate, phenobarbital and H2O2 were added to culture medium to increase the GA content [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, due to the unclear mechanism of ganoderic acid biosynthesis, determining the optimal fermentation conditions and screening an effective inducer to produce maximum quantities of GA are still a trial-and-error process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Isotopic tracer experiments have demonstrated that GA, a type of terpenoid, is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The genes that encode the proteins involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway have been cloned and characterized, and the regulation of the expression levels of these genes has been investigated under different environmental conditions to determine the relationship between GA biosynthesis and the expression of these genes [17]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that the over-expression of these biosynthetic genes results in an enhanced accumulation of GA in G. lucidum [21]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although these reports indicated that increased GA biosynthesis may result from the up-regulation of GA biosynthesis genes, how specific environmental conditions induce GA biosynthesis through the GA biosynthetic pathway remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, research on the GA biosynthesis mechanism has concentrated on the mevalonate pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>MeJA is a ubiquitous small signaling molecule in the plant kingdom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Environmental stresses, such as wounding or pathogen attack, can trigger MeJA production [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In plants, MeJA induces stomatal closure, monoterpenoid indole alkaloids and isoprenoid biosynthesis, and defense response pathogens by activating reactive oxygen species, the MAPK signal pathway, or the calcium-dependent protein kinase signal pathway [25]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In fungi, MeJA is involved in the modulation of Cryptococcus laurentii and Penicillium expansum growth [29] and the regulation of Aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis by Aspergillus parasiticus [30], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The same phenomenon is observed in G. lucidum; when different concentrations of MeJA were added to the culture, the GA contents were improved [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the transcript levels of the genes hmgr, fps, and sqs in the GA biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated in response to MeJA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, the signaling pathways initiated by MeJA to regulate GA biosynthesis and gene expression remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In this study, differentially expressed transcripts were screened in the MeJA-treated mycelium using cDNA-AFLP to gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of GA biosynthesis in response to MeJA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The differentially expressed transcripts were sequenced and classified, and their expression patterns were analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>For some of the regulated genes, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression patterns observed with cDNA-AFLP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In addition, the transcript levels of some of the candidate genes were investigated at various developmental stages of G. lucidum. </plain></SENT>
