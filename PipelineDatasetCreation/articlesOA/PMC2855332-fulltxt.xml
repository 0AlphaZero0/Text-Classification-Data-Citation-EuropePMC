They cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in both animals and humans. The disease phenotype is not uniform within species, and stable, self-propagating variations in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation could encode this &#x02018;strain&#x02019; diversity. However, much remains to be learned about the physical relationship between the infectious agent and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregation state, and how this varies according to the strain. We applied a sedimentation velocity technique to a panel of natural, biologically cloned strains obtained by propagation of classical and atypical sheep scrapie and BSE infectious sources in transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP. Detergent-solubilized, infected brain homogenates were used as starting material. Solubilization conditions were optimized to separate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates from PrP<sup>C</sup>. The distribution of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and infectivity in the gradient was determined by immunoblotting and mouse bioassay, respectively. As a general feature, a major proteinase K-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> peak was observed in the middle part of the gradient. This population approximately corresponds to multimers of 12&#x02013;30 PrP molecules, if constituted of PrP only. For two strains, infectivity peaked in a markedly different region of the gradient. This most infectious component sedimented very slowly, suggesting small size oligomers and/or low density PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates. Extending this study to hamster prions passaged in hamster PrP transgenic mice revealed that the highly infectious, slowly sedimenting particles could be a feature of strains able to induce a rapidly lethal disease. Our findings suggest that prion infectious particles are subjected to marked strain-dependent variations, which in turn could influence the strain biological phenotype, in particular the replication dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Prions are unconventional transmissible agents causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases in human and animals. They are thought to be formed from polymers of abnormal conformations of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP), but little is known about the physical organization of the infectious particles and any relationship between packing order and infectivity. As an additional layer of complexity, different PrP conformational variants associated with distinct biological phenotypes, or &#x02018;strains&#x02019;, can propagate in the same host. We subjected PrP polymers from eight different ovine and hamster prion strains to sedimentation velocity centrifugation, which allows separation of macromolecular complexes according to their size, density or shape. We showed that, whereas the PrP sedimentation profiles share common features, the infectivity profiles exhibit striking differences amongst the strains. For four of them, the infectious component was predominantly associated with slowly sedimenting particles, suggestive of small size oligomers and/or low density PrP aggregates. Such particles appeared to be a feature of strains able to induce a rapidly lethal disease in the recipient host. Our findings suggest that prion infectious particles are subjected to marked strain-dependent variations, which in turn could influence the strain biological phenotype, in particular the replication dynamics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), such as human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, sheep scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and chronic wasting disease of cervidae, are infectious, fatal, neurodegenerative disorders caused by prions <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Collinge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Prions are unconventional pathogens primarily composed of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, a rearranged conformer of the ubiquitously expressed prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>), whose precise physiological function is largely unknown. Upon infection, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> dictates the self-perpetuating conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into nascent PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. This conversion involves &#x02013; without any apparent post-translational modification &#x02013; the refolding of soluble, alpha-helix-rich PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules into beta-sheet enriched PrP<sup>Sc</sup> polymers that form deposits in TSE-infected brains <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Prusiner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Weissmann1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and are assumed to be responsible for the observed neurodegenerative disorders <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Mallucci1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The conversion reaction may proceed through a nucleated polymerization mechanism in which PrP<sup>Sc</sup> multimers recruit PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules and trigger their conformational conversion into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (for review <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Caughey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). The refolding/multimerisation process confers distinct physico-chemical properties to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, such as insolubility in non-denaturing detergents and partial resistance to proteolysis <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Bolton1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Distinct prion entities, referred to as strains, are known to self-propagate in the same host and exhibit distinguishable phenotypic traits that are heritable, such as incubation time, neuropathological and biochemical properties (for reviews: <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Beringue1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Bruce1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000859-Collinge2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>).

Of note, almost all of these studies used substantially purified PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as a starting material.</p><p>In this study, we developed a specific protocol to fractionate PrP particles according to their sedimentation velocity properties in a viscous medium, characterized their relative levels of infectivity and looked for strain-specific variations. In contrast to previous reports, experiments were performed on crude brain homogenates, which <italic>a priori</italic> contain all TSE infectivity. We worked with a panel of strains that were biologically cloned on homogeneous genetic backgrounds, obtained after transmission of either classical and atypical (Nor98) sheep scrapie and BSE, or hamster scrapie infectious sources in transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP (VRQ allele; <italic>tg338</italic> mice) and hamster PrP (<italic>tg7</italic> line), respectively. We demonstrate that the sedimentation profile of the infectious component dramatically varies with the strain. We further show that the predominance of slowly sedimenting infectious particles that segregate from the bulk of proteinase K-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> particles may be a distinctive feature of strains able to induce a rapidly lethal disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Optimizing the conditions to analyze non-denatured PrP<sup>Sc</sup> polymers by sedimentation velocity</title><p>PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates present in detergent-solubilised brain tissue homogenates were fractionated by sedimentation velocity centrifugation in an iodixanol gradient (Optiprep).

<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref> for information on the strains used in this study). As a first step, we tested a variety of detergents for solubilization, which showed variable efficacy in terms of partition of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> species. For example, the use of standard solubilization buffers containing Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate or sarkosyl led to sedimentation of both isoforms throughout the gradient (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000859.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), indicating an incomplete release of total PrP from cellular constituents. In contrast, the sequential use of dodecyl maltoside and sarkosyl resulted in more efficient separation of the two PrP isoforms. Thus, in the conditions eventually employed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000859-g001">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>

</xref>, black line) were mainly detected in fractions 6&#x02013;20 of the gradient. Importantly, no pelleted PrP material was observed in the selected conditions. Increasing the ultracentrifugation time caused the majority of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to sediment toward the heaviest fractions of the gradient, indicating that this material had not reached its density equilibrium (data not shown).

Altogether, these findings lend support to the view that the predominance of slow sedimenting particles may be a common feature of prion strains with short incubation time.</p><p>Such a decoupling between infectivity and PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with respect to the size of the particles is to our knowledge unprecedented in the literature.

This would imply that the tightness of such an interaction specifically differs between strains.
