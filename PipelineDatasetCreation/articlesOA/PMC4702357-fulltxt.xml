By autocrine and paracrine means, EAT can generate various kinds of cytokines, inflammatory mediators and free fatty acids. These biological indicators can affect the state of coronary endothelial function and promote inflammation and oxidative stress, which finally aggravate the progression of coronary atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A significant amount of clinical research has been conducted to investigate the link between EAT and coronary atherosclerosis. It was claimed that calcified plaque progression in patients without coronary artery disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were associated with a larger EAT volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Epicardial adipose tissue is also an independent predictor of significant coronary stenosis and is independently associated with high-risk coronary plaque features, such as low CT attenuation plaque, thin-cap fibroatheroma and positive remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Not only is EAT, as a special visceral fat, correlated with the increased development of coronary artery atherosclerosis, but it is also associated with adverse coronary events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Treatment of epicardial adipose tissue and coronary atherosclerosis</title><p>There are ample studies exploring the progression of coronary atherosclerosis following pharmacological manipulation. At the time of writing, the use of statins is recognized as an effective treatment; statins can result in decreases in plaque and necrotic core volume, and can also significantly reduce the progression of low attenuation plaque (&#x0003c;30 Hounsfield units) and non-calcified plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other drugs, such as dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], a PPAR&#x003b3; agonist (pioglitazone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], atorvastatin plus ezetimibe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], olmesartan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], have also been reported to have antiatherosclerotic effects, although the effects have not been verified by large-scale studies. As studies show that EAT volume is associated with plaque progression and cardiovascular adverse events, treatments aimed at reducing EAT volume may finally achieve an antiatherosclerotic, preventive effect. However, at the time of writing, limited studies have aimed at reducing both EAT and plaque volume to achieve an antiatherosclerotic effect. A serial coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) study recently indicated that intensive statin therapy can reduce the EAT volume of Europeans, but the study failed to demonstrate a relationship among EAT volume reduction, coronary atherosclerosis progression and clinical prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; moreover, intensive statin therapy might not be appropriate for Asians. The epidemiological studies and clinical researches show that Asians may have poorer tolerability and safety to intensive statins than white people, owing to genetic differences (variants in structure or polymorphisms) in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has been claimed that polymorphic variants in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) families that were associated with statin metabolism might result in varying rates of metabolic clearance. CYP450 2C19 slow metabolizer phenotype was reported to be present in approximately 16&#x000a0;% of Asians compared with only about 3&#x000a0;% of white people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Polymorphic variants in the predominant CYP450 isoform, CYP450 3A4, were reported to be associated with a functional decrease in the enzyme&#x02019;s activity in dyslipidemic Chinese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The HPS2-THRIVE study recently also indicated that, using same-dose statin treatment, an excess of increased alanine aminotransferase was seen mainly among Chinese patients (more than three consecutive values above the upper limit of normal of 0.24&#x000a0;%/year compared with 0.02&#x000a0;%/year in Europe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, the morbidity of chronic hepatitis B was high in china with nearly 90 million infections. For these reasons, intensive statin therapy may result in higher hepatotoxicity in Asian populations than in white populations, so low- to moderate- dose statin therapy might be more appropriate for Asian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Subjects who undergo weight loss exercise, bariatric surgery, or low-dose aspirin therapy can also reduce EAT volume or inflammation, but the effects are weak and these treatments cannot achieve good results in patients with coronary atherosclerosis progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our aim is to find a drug that reduces EAT volume while inhibiting the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.</p><p>In recent years, studies have confirmed that olmesartan medoxomil can improve endothelial function, resist thrombosis, improve tissue reconstruction, and resist oxidative stress to achieve atherosclerosis resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The latest research shows that olmesartan medoxomil can better inhibit rat epididymal adipose cell hypertrophy and inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that olmesartan medoxomil may also reduce EAT volume, finally achieving an anti-atherosclerosis effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>EAT and coronary atherosclerosis imaging with computed tomography</title><p>Compared with such invasive methods as intravascular ultrasound, virtual histology intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and fractional flow reserve, CCTA has emerged as a noninvasive imaging method that analyzes both coronary atherosclerosis and EAT volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

All enrolled patients will be instructed in the breath-holding technique before CCTA to minimize breathing artifacts. Three minutes before CCTA, all patients will be given 0.5&#x000a0;mg nitroglycerin sublingually to dilate the coronary artery. The scan range is from the carina or the pulmonary artery segment down to 1&#x000a0;cm below the diaphragm. Electrocardiography is continuously performed throughout the entire examination for each patient. A dual-head power injector (SCT 210, Medrad, USA) and a nonionic contrast medium (Ultravist&#x000ae;, 370&#x000a0;mg I /ml, Schering AG, Guangzhou, China) will be used. The collimation is 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;128&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;mm, the gantry rotation time is 0.28&#x000a0;ms, the slice thickness is 0.6&#x000a0;mm, the tube voltage is 80 to 120&#x000a0;kV (modified using a care kV, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany), and the tube current is 290 to 560 mAs/rotation (scout-based automatic reference tube current selection &#x02013; CareDose 4D, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany). For double flash acquisition, the pitch is 3.4, and for retrospectively ECG-triggered spiral acquisition, the pitch will vary depending on the patient&#x02019;s heart rate. Total estimated radiation dose for the patient will be recorded.</p><p>Patients with a heart rate &#x02264;70 beats/min will be evaluated using double prospective ECG-gated high-pitch CT angiography (double flash mode). For the double flash protocol, the contrast-enhanced CCTA protocol is as follows: a test bolus scan will be performed at the level of the aortic root with administration of 15&#x000a0;ml of contrast medium into the right antecubital vein at a rate of 5.0&#x000a0;ml/s, followed by an injection of 20&#x000a0;ml of saline flush at the same flow rate to obtain a peak enhancement time curve. The double flash acquisition triggered scan time is 4&#x000a0;s after the peak enhancement time. After calculating the triggered scan time, double flash acquisition will be performed by injecting 60 to 90&#x000a0;ml contrast medium at a rate of 5.0&#x000a0;ml/s, immediately followed by 35&#x000a0;ml of 70/30 contrast/saline material mixture and 50&#x000a0;ml saline bolus at the same flow rate. The first scan will begin at 60&#x000a0;% of the R-R interval from the craniocaudal direction. The second scan will be acquired at 30&#x000a0;% of the R-R interval 3&#x000a0;s after the first scan during the same contrast injection time.</p><p>Patients with a heart rate &#x0003e;70 beats/min will be evaluated using retrospectively ECG-triggered spiral acquisition. The retrospective protocol is as follows: 60 to 90&#x000a0;ml contrast medium is injected into the antecubital vein at a rate of 5.0&#x000a0;ml/s, immediately followed by 50&#x000a0;ml saline solution at the same flow rate. Bolus tracking is used, and the region of interest is set at the root of the ascending aorta. We will perform the scan with a delay of 5&#x000a0;s after the root of the ascending aorta reaches a threshold of 100 Hounsfield units. For this scan mode, the acquisition is from 30&#x000a0;% to 80&#x000a0;% of the R-R interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>CCTA image post-processing</title><p>All CCTA data will be sent to the Syngo Multi-Modality Workplace for post-processing. Two independent experienced observers who are unaware of the patients&#x02019; clinical information will evaluate the CCTA data in different modes, including maximum intensity projection, volume rendering, curved-planar reconstructions, and the original transaxial images.

The region of interest in measuring the EAT volume includes the heart and the surrounding EAT. By manually tracing the epicardium contours in the axial slices from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the diaphragm, the EAT volume is analyzed. The pericardium contour is traced every 10&#x000a0;mm, from the lower visible level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation until the top level of the pulmonary valve, for every 20&#x000a0;mm until the first slice where the diaphragm becomes visible, and for every 10&#x000a0;mm from this point until the last slice where the pericardium is still visible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The pericardium contour is manually outlined by the radiologists, and then the software (Syngo Volume, Siemens Medical Solutions) automatically calculates the total EAT volume. Computed tomography attenuation ranging from &#x02212;195 to 45 Hounsfield units is applied to isolate the EAT from other tissues. Mediastinal adipose tissue and pericardial adipose fat (fat deposit outside the visceral pericardium and on the external surface of the parietal pericardium) are excluded from the analysis. For the assessment of interobserver agreement, we will randomly select 50 patients, and all EAT measures will be assessed by two experienced radiologists blinded to the other radiologist&#x02019;s measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Definition of coronary atherosclerosis plaque progression</title><p>We will use QAngio CT post-processing software (QAngioCT Research Edition version 2.1.0, Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, the Netherlands) to evaluate all CCTA data.

These markers will be measured at baseline and 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Clinical follow-up will take place at 1&#x000a0;month (&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;week), 3&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;weeks), 6&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;weeks), 9&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;30&#x000a0;days), and 1&#x000a0;year (&#x000b1;30&#x000a0;days) by clinical visit or phone interview.</p><p>At baseline and 6-month (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;weeks) and 1&#x000a0;year (&#x000b1;30&#x000a0;days) follow-ups, all patients will provide venous blood for detection of blood lipids, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, NO, ET-1, MMP-9, adiponectin, and leptin.</p><p>At 1&#x000a0;year (&#x000b1;30&#x000a0;days) follow-up, all patients will undergo CCTA (with QAngio CT post-processing software).We anticipated a patient drop-out rate of 10&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>This trial is an open-label randomized clinical trial, so patients will randomly be assigned to olmesartan medoxomil or conventional antihypertensive medication groups (1:1 ratio). The purpose of this study is to verify that olmesartan medoxomil is effective in the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis progression and EAT volume reduction in patients with coronary atherosclerosis detected by CCTA. We also want to elucidate the relationship between coronary atherosclerosis and EAT. The mechanism by which olmesartan medoxomil inhibits coronary atherosclerosis progression will be studied by detecting the serum levels of blood lipids, glucose, circulating surrogate markers of atherosclerosis inflammation including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, and MMP-9, circulating surrogate markers of endothelial function, including NO and ET-1, and circulating surrogate markers of adipose tissue inflammation and metabolism, including adiponectin and leptin.</p><p>Studies on coronary atherosclerosis progression rate have had differing results. The combined results of multiple studies indicate that the conventional mean coronary atherosclerosis progression rate is about 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We hypothesize that additional olmesartan medoxomil use will reduce the coronary atherosclerosis progression rate to 13&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Using double-side inspection, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2, we calculate a total sample size of 176 cases; considering the expected loss to follow-up to be 10&#x000a0;%, the number of cases to be included should be at least 176&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x000a0;%)&#x02009;=&#x02009;194. Therefore, we aim for 97 cases of each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables will be described using means and standard deviations or median and range in case of asymmetric distribution of data. Categorical variables will be presented using frequency distribution. Univariate analyses will be conducted using chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests for independent samples.

As studies show that EAT volume is associated with plaque progression and cardiovascular adverse events, treatments aimed at reducing EAT volume may finally achieve an antiatherosclerotic, preventive effect. However, at the time of writing, only a limited number of studies have aimed to reduce both EAT and plaque volume to achieve a preventive effect against atherosclerosis. The novelty of this study is that we intend to explore the effect of olmesartan medoxomil on both plaque volume and epicardial fat. This study will accomplish two goals: (1) it will explain the relationship between EAT volume and coronary atherosclerosis progression and (2) it will verify the effect of olmesartan medoxomil on EAT volume reduction and coronary atherosclerosis progression.</p><p>If these hypotheses are supported, the study findings will have significant implications related to clinical practice. Evidence that olmesartan medoxomil is effective on EAT volume reduction and coronary atherosclerosis progression would be very attractive to clinicians and patients. This may further contribute to the care of patients with coronary heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment for the study is currently ongoing.
