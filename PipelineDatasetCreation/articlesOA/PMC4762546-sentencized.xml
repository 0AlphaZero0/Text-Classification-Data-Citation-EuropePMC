</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Arsenophonus nasoniae is a rod-like Gammaproteobacterium with a large genome and a substantial metabolic capability [1;2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In laboratory conditions it is cultivable in supplemented cell-free media [3]. Arsenophonus nasoniae harbours unusual combination of pathogenic and symbiotic features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It was originally described as an endosymbiont of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis, yet induces the so-called male killing phenotype—production of female biased secondary sex ratio associated with the death of 80% of male offspring [4;5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Unlike other intracellular bacteria, A. nasoniae was found only within the somatic tissue and interstitial fluid surrounding the germ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These bacteria are ingested by feeding wasp larvae and invade its body through the gut, thus capable to re-infect the reproductive and other tissues of the parasitoid [6]. Arsenophonus nasoniae was described in several parasitoid wasp species which belong to the Chalcidoidea superfamily, e.g.: Nasonia longicornis, Spalangia endius, Spalangia cameronii, Eupelmus vesiculari, Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae and Muscidifurax raptor [7;8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The chalcid wasp, I. hookeri, was reported in Central Europe for the first time by Bouček and Černý [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, it is distributed worldwide and parasitizes a broad range of hard tick species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This parasitic wasp oviposits to feeding and unfed larval and nymphal tick hosts, but the development of the eggs only occurs in fully engorged nymphs [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Once hatched, larvae of the wasp begin to feed on the tick tissue, eventually causing its death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Unlike other parasitic Chalcidoidea, larvae of I. hookeri consume also the vertebrate blood ingested by the nymphs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This diet is unique among the parasitic species of Hymenoptera families [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Wasps emerge from their hosts through a single hole gnawed at the posterior end of the abdomen, where the cuticle is the thinnest [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Rickettsiae are well-known tick-associated, obligate intracellular Alfaproteobacteria [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Ecological characteristics of the tick vectors of rickettsiae influence the epidemiology and clinical aspects of tick-borne diseases [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Ticks may acquire rickettsiae through transovarial transmission (the transfer of bacteria from the adult female ticks to the subsequent generation of ticks via the eggs) and/or transstadial transmission, i.e. the transfer of bacteria from stage to stage [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this study we developed a specific Real-Time PCR tailored for the detection of the I. hookeri DNA and aimed to find (1) an association between the presence of A. nasoniae and I. hookeri in ticks and (2) an influence of the parasitoids on rickettsial infection in ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Finally, we hypothesized how the bacteria and parasitoids could act in the developmental cycle of ticks to which the ontogenesis of wasps is connected. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Among arthropod vectors, ticks harbour the largest diversity of microorganisms, ranging from viruses (tick-borne encephalitis), to bacteria (Rickettsia sp., Borrelia spp., species from Anaplasmataceae family, etc.) and/or eukaryotes (Babesia sp., Theileria sp.) [20;21]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>We proposed that the presence of A. nasoniae in ticks depends on their developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
