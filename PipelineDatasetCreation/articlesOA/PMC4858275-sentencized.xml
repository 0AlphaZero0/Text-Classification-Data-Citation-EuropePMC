</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Protein domains are structural, functional and evolutionary building blocks that can form various architectures consisting of one or several domains [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Protein domain repeats are strings of the same class of domain repeated one after another—tandem repeats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These domains are often short and their sequences are highly diverse, where typically only a motif is retained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Proteins evolve through mutations involving one or a few residues and by domain rearrangements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The latter are comparatively well tolerated since, in many cases, protein domains perform modular functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Repeat proteins have high variability with regard to the number of repeats in the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>They differ from other proteins in the sense that they tend to expand through internal duplications rather than domain shuffling [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A likely scenario is that repeat proteins expand rapidly until a physical/structural limit has been reached and subsequently diverge rapidly since repeat domains tend to only have weak sequence similarity [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for their propensity is that their structures allow expansion and, additionally, may provide novel ligand binding [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Large expansions of protein repeats are quite common [5] and even commonplace in higher eukaryotes while they are rare in prokaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, one medically important example of large repeat expansions in prokaryotes are the events that have taken place within the pentapeptide-2 (PP2) proteins in Mycobacteria [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The PP2 repeat consists of five amino acids that are repeated one after the other in the proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The structure of the pentapeptide-2 repeat remains unknown, but its sister protein families [7] form four-sided parallell beta-helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In Mycobacteria, there are predominantly two classes of proteins that contain PP2 repeats, namely the PE family (Proline-Glutamic Acid) and the PPE (Proline-Proline-Glutamic Acid) family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The number of repeats varies significantly between groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>M. tuberculosis is a pathogen that has limited genetic diversity and has likely emerged from more diverse strains by gaining virulence mechanisms [8] and the PPE_MPTR proteins are likely candidates for these emerging phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Along with its sister group, the PE_PGRS proteins, the PPE_MPTR proteins have been shown to be secreted through the ESX-5 (one of the secretion VII systems), probably affecting macrophage response [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the PGRS and MPTR families have expanded along with duplications of the ESX-5 gene clusters, further supporting their importance for host response [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we elucidate the evolutionary path that has created the plethora of PP2 repeats that can be found in the PPE_MPTR proteins of Mycobacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>By understanding the evolution of these proteins we can continue to elucidate the role of PP2 repeats for mycobacterial pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The HMM covers eight repeat units but we were able to identify shorter and longer units by manual inspection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To identify regions of repeats we used the HMM profile for all four known pentapeptides using a sliding window along the entire sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A residue is classified as belonging to the HMM with the highest positive score. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>In the prokaryotes, long repeat proteins are comparatively rare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there are considerable repeat expansions in certain prokaryotic lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>Mutation rates in bacteria are non-randomly distributed across the genomes [38] and it has been suggested that such lineage-specific gene families may be of adaptive significance [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>We have found that the pentapeptide-2 repeats in the PE/PPE genes of Mycobacteria expand through single duplication events that encompass several domains (cassette duplications), possibly facilitated through homologous recombination which, although thought to be rare in Mycobacteria [40], is enriched in PE/PPE regions [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>The PE/PPE regions are also known to exhibit relaxed selective constraints [42] and rapid evolutionary rates [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>We have extracted a motif that is strongly linked to the proteins where large duplications have occurred. </plain></SENT>
