Introduction</title><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP), a common cause of abdominal pain, is usually a mild, self-limited disease. However 25% of the patients suffer from severe AP (SAP) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and 20% of SAP patients die, [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], mostly due to the development of multiple organ dysfunction [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Systemic inflammation, typical of AP, is considered to contribute to the development of organ dysfunction. It is characterized by (i) an increase in circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], anti-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a marker of activation of the vascular endothelium, (ii) occurrence of activated phagocytes in the circulation [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and (iii) a decrease in HLA-DR expression on blood monocytes [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], denoting the development of immune suppression.</p><p>Activated protein C (APC) is a plasma serine protease with effects on coagulation, apoptosis, and inflammation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. APC acts as an endogenous anticoagulant that promotes fibrinolysis and inhibits thrombosis. Protein C, an inactive precursor, is converted to activate protein C by thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelium [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This process is accelerated in the presence of endothelial PC receptor (EPCR) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. APC inactivates the procoagulation factor Va and VIIIa shutting down the coagulation pathway. APC also inactivates plasminogen activator inhibitor, which results in increased fibrinolysis [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>APC also has cytoprotective effects such as anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and endothelial barrier protection effects [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Proinflammatory cytokines upregulate thrombin formation and downregulate the host's antithrombotic mechanisms, in particular the protein C (PC) pathway reviewed in [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Deficiency of PC and decreased generation of activated PC (APC), the major endogenous anticoagulant in man, associate with the development of organ dysfunction in AP [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In patients with sepsis human recombinant APC shortened the duration of respiratory dysfunction and accelerated the reversal of shock [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We studied in a randomized trial patients with severe AP and found no differences in the evolution of multiorgan dysfunction between APC and placebo groups [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the effects of APC on inflammatory markers in patients with SAP have not been studied in a randomized controlled trial previously.</p><p>Accordingly, we aimed to determine the effects of the APC intervention on plasma levels of proinflammatory (IL-8), pro-/anti-inflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] cytokines and sE-selectin, on activation markers of blood monocytes (CD14, CD11b, CD62L) and neutrophils (CD11b, CD62L), on levels of monocyte cell-surface expression of HLA-DR, a marker of immune suppression, and on serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a marker of systemic inflammation used in clinical decision making.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Subjects and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients and Healthy Subjects</title><p>We previously conducted a randomized study of APC in SAP patients [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In brief, this prospective randomized double-blind study included analysis of 32 patients with SAP in the tertiary care unit at the Helsinki University Central Hospital between June 2003 and August 2007. The inclusion criteria were (1) admitted to hospital &#x0003c;96&#x02009;h from the onset of pain, (2) a 3-fold increase in serum amylase (IU/L) over normal upper range or/and verification of SAP in computer tomography, (3) at least one organ dysfunction (OD) defined as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) of at least 3 of 4, and (4) &#x0003c;48 hours from the first OD. Patients were randomized to receive either APC (drotrecogin alfa activated) (<italic>N</italic> = 16) or 0.9% physiologic saline as placebo (<italic>N</italic> = 16). APC was administrated for 96 hours with a dose of 24&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/hour.</p><p>We obtained reference blood samples for the analyses of cell surface markers by flow cytometry from 65 healthy volunteers (137 samples) from the hospital and laboratory staff without medication and with no signs of infection. To monitor the level of fluorescence intensity, a blood sample from a healthy volunteer was studied according to the study protocol once a week. There were 58 women and 7 men in the reference group. In case of repeated sampling, mean of the data was used.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Helsinki University Central Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their next of kin. The study protocol was registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01017107).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Blood Samples</title><p>When a patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria we collected peripheral blood samples for determination of cell markers of inflammation by venipuncture for the first time. Then the patients were randomized. After that follow-up samples were collected in the morning of the third, fifth, seventh, and 14th day. Blood samples for flow cytometry and for plasma measurements were anticoagulated with pyrogen-free acid-citrate dextrose (ACD). Blood samples were immediately cooled in an ice-cold water bath and kept at 0&#x000b0;C until stained for flow cytometry. The plasma was separated by centrifugation at +4&#x000b0;C and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until concentrations of cytokines and sE-selectin were determined. Blood samples for determination of serum PCT were collected concurrently.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Analysis of Soluble Markers</title><p>The concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1Ra, and E-selectin in plasma samples were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) by using commercial reagents (IL-6 and IL-10: PeliPair ELISA, Sanquin, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; IL-8: Opt EIA, BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium; IL-1Ra: Duo Set ELISA, R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd, Abindgon, UK; E-Selectin: ELISA, HyCult Biotechnology, Uden, The Netherlands). The detection limits and intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation (CV%) were as follows: IL-6: 0.3&#x02009;pg/mL, 3.6% and 5.4%; IL-8: 1.6&#x02009;pg/mL, 3.5%, 3.4%; IL-10: 0.3&#x02009;pg/mL, 3.7%, 5.9%; IL-1Ra: 10&#x02009;pg/mL, 4.2%, 5.2%; E-selectin 20.5&#x02009;pg/mL, 3.5%, 6.9%.</p><p>Procalcitonin (PCT) was measured using ADVIA Centaur XP immunoassay system with ADVIA Centaur BRAHMS PCT assay. Assay is a sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay using monoclonal antibody to fluorescein covalently linked to paramagnetic particles and two antibodies to procalcitonin labelled with fluorescein. According to the manufacturer, the within-run precision of the method is 4.3%, 1.5%, and 1.5% for PCT at 0.2, 0.97, and 65.9&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L, respectively. The between-run precision is 8.5%, 2.1%, and 7.2% for the respective concentrations.

<statement id="head1"><title>Monoclonal Antibodies and Flow Cytometry</title><p>Monocyte expression of CD14, CD11b, CD62L and HLA-DR and neutrophil expression of CD62L and CD11b were determined using whole blood flow cytometry, as described previously [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were as follows: phycoerythrin (PE) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugates of anti-CD14 mAb (IgG2b, clone MFP9), PE conjugates of anti-HLA-DR mAb (IgG2a, clone L243), anti CD11b mAb (IgG2a, clone D12) and control mouse IgG2a, mAb, and FITC conjugate of anti-CD62L mAb (IgG2a, clone SK11). All reagents were purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA, USA). Staining of aliquots of the whole blood sample at 0&#x000b0;C for flow cytometry was carried out as described previously [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Data acquisition and analyses were done by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (BD Sciences, San Jose, CA). Neutrophils were identified by the light scattering properties and monocytes by the clonal marker CD14. Monocyte HLA-DR expression was determined as the proportion of HLA-DR positive monocytes, as described earlier [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>The results show that recombinant APC (drotrecogin alfa activated) treatment of patients with SAP did not alter the course of systemic inflammation, as determined using soluble and cellular markers of systemic inflammatory response. This is in accordance with the clinical findings of these patients, which indicated that SOFA score changes, organ-failure-free days, ICU or hospital stay time, ventilator-free days, renal replacement therapy-free days, vasopressor-free days, or days alive outside hospital (in 60 days) were comparable between APC and placebo groups [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The overall decreasing tendency of cytokines during the followup resembles earlier results, which show that both pro- and anti-inflammatory bursts are an early phenomenon in severe AP [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Several in vitro and animal studies show that APC has an anti-inflammatory activity. Administration of APC has been shown to downregulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. APC blocks cytokine production from Th2 lymphocytes [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. APC has been shown to reduce production of endotoxemia-induced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF alfa) [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In vitro the production of IL-8 from monocytes is inhibited by APC (LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In vitro APC has been shown to inhibit chemotaxis and IL-6 release by human neutrophils [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. APC inhibits TNF-alpha production by blocking nuclear factor (NF) kB transcription factor in monocytes [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. APC has been shown to upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators, like IL-10 in blood monocytes in patients with severe sepsis [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. APC can also block leukocyte trafficking by decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1) on the endothelium [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Several clinical trials have been established to evaluate the APC treatment in sepsis patients. In the PROWESS trial they found that recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa) reduced mortality in patients with severe sepsis [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this randomized multicentre trial they found decreases in D-dimer levels and IL-6 levels in patients' plasma that has been taken as evidence of anti-inflammatory action of APC [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HLA-DR expression, as marker of immunosuppression, has been shown to correlate with PC and APC levels in SAP [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Preliminary, still unpublished results from the PROWESS-SHOCK trial indicated that APC did not have a beneficial effect on 28-day survival in patients with septic shock.</p><p>No previous randomized trial has scrutinized the effect of APC in SAP patients, nor is there such evidence of APC's effect on inflammation in SAP. The present study of phlogistic markers supports the view that APC treatment does not affect either the course of systemic inflammation in agreement with no detected effect on organ dysfunction [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Limitations of the study.</italic> The sample size for the study (16 + 16) was determined according to the primary end point and not for comparing systemic inflammatory response between the groups. In addition the number of follow-up samples/patients was decreased at day five (12 + 14) and at day 14 (11 + 10); therefore it is not possible to exclude a type II error.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
