The intervention uses the behavior-change techniques (1) instruction on how, where and when to perform the behavior, (2) prompt goal setting for physical activity, (3) prompt self-monitoring of behavior, and (4) feedback on behavior. The primary outcome of physical activity will be measured using a physical activity monitor (Actigraph wGT3X-BT) for a period of 7&#x000a0;days, firstly 2&#x000a0;weeks before rehabilitation begins (t0) as well as 6&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after rehabilitation (t3, t4). Additionally, to predict physical activity progression after rehabilitation, a complex personal diagnostics battery, including questionnaires as well as functional assessments, is to be carried out at the start and end of rehabilitation (t1, t2). This battery is based on the foundational ideas of the Physical Activity-Related health Competence model.</p><p id="Par3">Five hundred and two patients with COPD, aged 18&#x000a0;years or older and admitted for an approved pulmonary rehabilitation, will be enrolled in the STAR study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">The STAR study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to gain a better understanding of the personal determinants of physical activity in patients with COPD and to evaluate a pedometer-based physical activity-change intervention in the context of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.

The reasons for successful PA behavior changes in patients with COPD are not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The role of psychological factors especially, and their interplay with physical functioning needs further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, following Spruit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], two aspects are needed for optimized patient treatment during PR: (1) a better understanding of the determinants of PA in patients with COPD and (2) effective strategies to improve important determinants and, accordingly, PA.</p><p id="Par15">In covering the first point, the concept of Physical Activity-related health Competence (the PARC model) provides a new model to describe personal determinants of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The PARC model focuses on personal competencies that favor the integration of PA in everyday life. The model&#x02019;s three components are movement competence, control competence, and self-regulation competence. These subcompetencies are directly linked to the requirements for initiating and maintaining PA with positive effects on health and wellbeing. In comparison to other health psychology models of health behavior, the competence-based perspective of the PARC model is considered to add value because it contains movement-related, task-specific as well as sport-typical elements. Notably, the PARC model incorporates important individual physical and psychological characteristics. This is especially important for the explanation of PA behavior of older adults and clinical populations. The first validated, generic questionnaire for the subcompetencies of the PARC model is now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For clinical populations, this questionnaire could profit from an extension with indication-specific characteristics (e.g., obstructive lung function for patients with COPD), allowing for a complex and adequate assessment of individual determinants of PA in clinical populations.</p><p id="Par16">With regard to the second point, the use of pedometers ranks as one of the most effective intervention elements for PA promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Pedometers offer various possibilities to design behavior-change strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In particular, pedometers are of use for persons to monitor and record their daily PA. Self-monitoring of behavior has been proven to be one of the most effective behavior-change techniques (BCT) in clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, pedometers are suitable in support of other BCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], e.g., individual goal setting in the unit steps per day or giving feedback on behavior. In nonclinical populations, pedometer-based interventions achieve an average increased PA level of approximately 2000 steps per day (effect size <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68) in comparison to control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinical populations provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of pedometers as part of rehabilitation for people with musculoskeletal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], type-2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] as well as COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, these results come from studies with small sample sizes in outpatient rehabilitation programs. Moreover, these studies often relate to short-term behavior changes during the rehabilitation period. The validity of most studies is further restricted by the usage of PA questionnaires instead of objective PA measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] summarized that pedometer studies&#x02019; sample sizes in PR were not, up to this point, suitable for the detection of meaningful differences in PA levels. In the context of inpatient PR the potential of pedometers to first initiate and afterward maintain a physically active lifestyle in the long term has not yet been investigated.</p><p id="Par17">The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to (1) evaluate the effect of a short, pedometer-based behavior-change intervention (BCI) for inpatient PR in COPD patients with regard to the initiation (6-week follow-up) and maintenance (6-month follow-up) of a physically active lifestyle after PR and (2) to predict the expected intervention treatment effect and PA progression after PR discharge utilizing an innovative diagnostic battery that is based on the PARC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The STAR study (Stay Active after Rehabilitation) aims to answer two central questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19"> does the integration of a pedometer-based intervention during inpatient PR for people with COPD, in comparison to standard PR, lead to a sustained improvement of PR results with regards to PA 6&#x000a0;weeks and 6&#x000a0;months after the PR?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20"> how does PA-related health competence of individuals with COPD develop during inpatient PR; and which individual PA-related health competence characteristics, in combination with which disease-specific prognostic assessments, enable the prediction of the expected intervention treatment effect as well as of the initiation and long-term maintenance of a physically active lifestyle after PR?</p></list-item></list>

The STAR study fills two gaps in the academic literature (1) it investigates the ability of PR to promote PA to patients with COPD in the long term and (2) it investigates COPD individuals&#x02019; personal determinants of (un-)successful PA changes.</p><p id="Par54">The RCT design allows the evaluation of a short, pedometer-based BCI for inpatient PR in COPD patients with regard to the initiation (6-week follow-up) and maintenance (6-month follow-up) of a physically active lifestyle after PR. The design is suitable to overcome restrictions in previous empirical findings due to several reasons: it contains an adequately powered sample size, objectively measures PA with a validated measurement tool, and collects baseline PA data before PR in study phase I as well as at the 6-month follow-up after PR (study phase II). The reason for the two-phased study design is not to overburden eligible participants during initial recruitment and thereby ensure higher participation rates. Adding an additional 12-month follow-up would detect enduring effects on PA thereby further strengthening the study design. Nevertheless, the academic literature indicates that PA status of COPD patients a few months and 1&#x000a0;year after PR is unlikely to differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. If the inexpensive, pedometer-based intervention proves its effectiveness it may be easily applied to similar inpatient rehabilitation programs. These findings may then also apply to other clinical populations.</p><p id="Par55">Furthermore, the study generates a better understanding as to why patients with COPD manage or fail to initiate and maintain PA after PR. Based on the concepts from the model of PA-related health competence (PARC model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] an adequate setup of individual physical and psychological determinants of PA will be assessed. The diagnostic battery will enrich our understanding of why the pedometer-based intervention works. In particular, the PA-related regulation competence is expected to contribute to this explanation of the intervention treatment effect. Furthermore, the results of a cluster-based analysis enable, regardless of the randomly controlled pedometer intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness, the future identification of patients with COPD who will find it difficult to engage in long-term, health-promoting PA after PR. Acquiring a valid model for the prediction of PA behavior is the basis for optimizing intervention strategies to promote PA in the context of PR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par56">The STAR study started in June 2016 and completion of recruitment is estimated for September.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
