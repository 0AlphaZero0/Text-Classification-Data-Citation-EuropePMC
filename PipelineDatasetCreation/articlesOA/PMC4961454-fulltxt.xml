No cure is yet available for this disease and infected trees generally decline after several months. Disease management depends on early detection of symptoms and chemical control of insect vectors. In this work, different combinations of organic compounds were tested for the ability to modulate citrus molecular responses to HLB disease beneficially. Three small-molecule regulating compounds were tested: 1) L-arginine, 2) 6-benzyl-adenine combined with gibberellins, and 3) sucrose combined with atrazine. Each treatment contained K-phite mineral solution and was tested at two different concentrations. Two trials were conducted: one in the greenhouse and the other in the orchard. In the greenhouse study, responses of 42 key genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism, hormone-related pathways, biotic stress responses, and secondary metabolism in treated and untreated mature leaves were analyzed. <italic>TGA5</italic> was significantly induced by arginine. Benzyladenine and gibberellins enhanced two important genes involved in biotic stress responses: <italic>WRKY54</italic> and <italic>WRKY59</italic>. Sucrose combined with atrazine mainly upregulated key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism such as sucrose-phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, starch synthase, and &#x003b1;-amylase. Atrazine also affected expression of some key genes involved in systemic acquired resistance such as <italic>EDS1</italic>, <italic>TGA6</italic>, <italic>WRKY33</italic>, and <italic>MYC2</italic>. Several treatments upregulated <italic>HSP82</italic>, which might help protect protein folding and integrity. A subset of key genes was chosen as biomarkers for molecular responses to treatments under field conditions. <italic>GPT2</italic> was downregulated by all small-molecule treatments. Arginine-induced genes involved in systemic acquired resistance included PR1, <italic>WRKY70</italic>, and <italic>EDS1</italic>. These molecular data encourage long-term application of treatments that combine these regulating molecules in field trials.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007565</institution-id><institution>Citrus Research and Development Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CATP09-305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dandekar</surname><given-names>Abhaya M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research reported in this publication was supported by grant# CATAP09-305 received from the Citrus Research and Development Foundation and supported the work conducted by all of the authors except Veronica Fileccia who was supported by the University of Palermo.

Huanglongbing (HLB) disease endangers the citrus industry and citrus cultivation worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Neither genetic resistance nor short- or long-term therapeutic strategies to mitigate HLB has been found. Huanglongbing disease is associated with three <italic>Candidatus liberibacter</italic> (C. Las) species: <italic>asiaticus</italic>, <italic>americanus</italic>, and <italic>africanus</italic>. C. Las is a member of the alpha subdivision of the proteobacteria based on ribosomal region sequence data [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Symptoms have been extensively described and all citrus species are susceptible to HLB to varying degrees [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Microarray analysis identified key genes and pathways affected by HLB at the transcriptomic level in mature, symptomatic leaves [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RNA-seq was applied to describe molecular responses in fruit with different degrees of HLB symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This allowed a comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory networks on source and sink tissues at different developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Effects of C. Las infection on key genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism, disrupting source-sink relationships, was a key cause of the metabolic dysfunction. Fruits of infected plants remained immature and photosynthesizing while mature leaves became yellow and accumulated starch [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Protein expression has been linked to the nutritional condition of grapefruit plants before and after symptom appearance. C. Las-upregulated proteins were involved in redox reactions, cell wall modification, and biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) identified which pathways are affected post-transcriptionally by pathogen infections [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A predictive proteome analysis of C. Las has been conducted [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Because no toxins or other pathogenic substances were clearly identified in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the pathogenetic mechanisms of HLB disease are still unclear, nor is it clear whether the HLB-associated changes in sugar and starch metabolism are a cause or an effect of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Current management procedures consist mainly of visual scouting for symptoms, PCR-based detection of the pathogen, and insecticides for vector control [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although application of insecticides can reduce disease spread, the disease can spread with only a few infected psyllids in the orchard. Early disease detection and psyllid control are critical practices in areas where neither disease nor vector has yet been discovered [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At present, no chemical compounds have been tested to beneficially modulate Citrus host responses and eventually extend the life and production of HLB-infected trees, reducing high economic costs due to lost production. Research has focused only on testing compounds targeting the pathogen. A combination of two antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) applied by either root soaking or foliar spray decreased C. Las titer in infected plants [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Antimicrobial compounds have been delivered through graft-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nanoemulsion formulations were evaluated for their ability to increase permeability of antimicrobial molecules with success dependent on the citrus cultivar and degree of HLB symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Small-molecule inhibitors designed by molecular docking were significantly effective in inhibiting SecA ATPase in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Extensive use of antibiotics in open fields is not desirable due to environmental and human health concerns. Host-based treatments that modulate key genes involved in metabolic HLB syndrome are highly desirable. Data on citrus molecular responses to HLB can now be exploited to design small-molecule combinations to ameliorate the devastating symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine if small molecules are effective in modulating expression of key HLB-regulated or innate response genes after three to six days of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Greenhouse trial</title><p>In 2011, Valencia orange scions on Kuharske Carrizo rootstocks were grown in one-gallon plastic nursery containers and kept in the greenhouse under natural light at 17 to 25&#x000b0;C. Graft inoculations were performed using a standard inverted &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; budding technique with C. Las-infected budwood tested as described [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Starting three months after budding, each plant was tested monthly using quantitative RT-PCR for C. Las species as described [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each control or treatment was represented by nine to 10 trees. The control consisted of trees sprayed with distilled water. The first treatment consisted of a Silwet (0.12%), DKP3XTRA (32.5 mL/20 L) and LK-phite spray (2 mL/20 L). The other six spray treatments were composed of three different small-molecule combinations at two different concentrations each: 1) L-arginine at 1 mM or 0.5 mM, 2) 120 &#x003bc;M 6-benzyl adenine in combination with 15 or 30 &#x003bc;M gibberellin, and 3) 80 mM sucrose combined with the herbicide atrazine (2 &#x003bc;M or 1 &#x003bc;M). All seven treatments contained the surfactant Silwet and LK-phite at the same concentration used for the first treatment. Phenotypes were evaluated to determine any phytotoxic effects of these sprays. All treatments were sprayed on the citrus foliage; the volume sprayed per tree was enough to wet both upper and lower leaf surfaces just to the point of runoff. Gene expression analyses were conducted on RNA extracted three days following treatment. Three biological replicates of nine mature leaves harvested from three trees (three leaves per tree) were analyzed for each treatment. Collected leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA was extracted. Forty-two host genes were analyzed in mature symptomatic leaves of treated and untreated trees.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Field trial</title><p>The same treatments were applied during the field experiments, which were conducted in a commercial citrus orchard in Indian Ricer County, FL, composed of Valencia orange scions on Swingle rootstocks. The study was conducted on private land and the owner of the land gave permission to conduct the study on the site of our experiments. We also confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Twenty-four trees of medium height, 12 trees per row, were selected. These trees were mildly HLB-symptomatic and confirmed infected by C. Las through the same qPCR assay used for the greenhouse trial. The experimental design was a completely randomized blocks. There were eight treatments with three single-tree replicates. Samples were collected at three and six days following treatment. Each replicate was a pool of 10 mature symptomatic leaves per tree.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from mature, fully-expanded leaves of plants grown in the greenhouse or orchard using the Rneasy Plant RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen Inc., Germany). The RNA concentration and purity were assessed by Nanodrop (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., MA, USA). RNA was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analyzed. For each target gene, PCR primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159610.s001">S1 Table</xref>). DNase treatment and cDNA synthesis were completed following a combined protocol based on the Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen Inc., Germany). A standard curve determined the linearity of amplicon quantity vs. initial cDNA quantity for each gene. Five &#x003bc;L cDNA at five ng/&#x003bc;L was diluted to a 12-&#x003bc;L final volume using Sybr Green Master Mix (Bio Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Amplifications were performed using standard conditions: 2 min at 50&#x000b0;C, 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95&#x000b0;C, and 60 s at 60&#x000b0;C. Fluorescent signals were collected during the annealing temperature and &#x00394;CT was calculated. Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1a, accession AY498567) was used as reference gene. &#x00394;&#x00394;CT was determined by subtracting the average EF-1a CT from the average CT of the studied gene [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Phenotypic measurements</title><p>Four phenotypic parameters for all treated and untreated trees were measured in the field: trunk diameter (mm), trunk height (m), width drill (m), and width row (m).

Gene expression and phenotypic data were analyzed using ANOVA and a post-hoc test to identify significant differences among treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data. Data analysis was performed to alleviate possible bias caused by the collected material for each class or by other confounding factors. Principal component analysis was applied to the ratio matrix of gene expression data to examine the contribution of each target parameter to the separation of the sample classes. A biplot was constructed based on the first two principal components.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><p>Gene expression analyses were conducted in the greenhouse and orchard. First, in greenhouse-grown plants, we quantified transcript abundance of 42 genes selected for their link with for being strongly up- or down-regulated by HLB syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or for having a well-known role in plant responses to pathogen attacks [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Second, we selected a subset of five particularly representative genes to be analyzed in field-grown trees, to which we added an additional two genes previously linked with HLB syndrome in published data [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The presence of leaf drop or discoloration and other morphological features of trees were measured to check whether these treatments had deleterious effects on important vegetative parameters.</p><p>At advanced stages, HLB blocks sugar transport out of leaves, leading to starch accumulation in leaves, reduced photosynthesis and disrupted source-sink relationships [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Anatomical analysis showed that HLB caused phloem disruption, increased sucrose, and plugged sieve pores [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The disease also negatively modifies JA-SA crosstalk, leading to an ineffective innate immune response [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The three small-molecule treatments were selected for the potential to beneficially modulate these negative HLB-regulated responses. The combination of atrazine and sucrose upregulates genes associated with reactive-oxygen-species (ROS) defense mechanisms and sucrose metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We postulated that this treatment might upregulate genes that reduce sucrose and starch accumulation. Because L-arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide, which is involved in the SAR response and upregulates genes involved in secondary metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we designed a second treatment consisting of two concentrations of L-arginine to induce upregulation of genes for secondary metabolic pathways such as phenols and terpenoids. Gibberellins boost systemic acquired resistance [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], favoring the resistance response against biotrophs such as C. Las [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Benzyladenine downregulates hexose transport in leaves, based on data deposited in the Genevestigator database. Indeed, we postulated that the combination of gybberellins and L-benzyladenine should have two synergistic effecs: 1) it should beneficially induce genes involved in the innate response against C.

We did not pretend to reduce pathogen titers or cure the plants with only one treatment. Before performing a long-term study, we wanted to evaluate the ability of the treatments to modulate expression of a subset of key genes that are altered during HLB syndrome. As we expected pathogen titers did not significantly differ among treated and control trees. A long-term study will reveal if repetitive and continuous applications will reduce pathogen concentrations and symptom severity.</p><p>Treatments were designed based on previously proposed hypotheses. Sucrose-induced protection against atrazine effects was linked to upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) defence and repair mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by l-arginine. Treatment with arginine provoked resistance against <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in tomato at three to six days after treatment. Endogenous NO concentrations correlated positively with induction of key enzymes involved in biotic stress responses such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chitinase, &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase and polyphenoloxidase [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Gibberellins regulate plant growth by modulating degradation of growth-repressing DELLA proteins that promote susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens and resistance to necrotrophic pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is accomplished by modulating the relative strength of the SA and JA signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Through regulation of DELLA stability, gibberellins affect the SA-JA-ET network and plant immune response. Genevestigator showed that benzyl-adenine downregulated the glucose-phosphate transporter in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Since this gene is induced by HLB metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], benzyl-adenine treatments might help mitigate the negative effects of HLB on leaf metabolism. In combination, the two hormones may beneficially modulate key HLB-regulated genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>K-phite mineral solution was also tested, alone or in combination with the three small molecule compounds. This treatment was considered because of contrasting published reports on the effects of nutrient solutions such as K-phite [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mineral solutions increased the concentrations of important N, Mn, Zn and B ions in leaves and long-term application reduced pathogen titer, leaf size, and leaf weight [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although enhanced nutritional solutions composed of essential micronutrients did not improve fruit production and quality of C. Las-infected trees [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], others results support the hypothesis that the pathogen severely affects nutrient patterns [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, foliar nutrition and soil conditioners helped reduce economic and production losses due to HLB [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>To determine how the treatments affected the metabolism of infected trees, 42 genes were selected from previously published Citrus transcriptome data [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These genes fell into three subsets involved in: 1) carbohydrate metabolism and signaling, 2) innate immune responses, including key players in JA-SA signaling, crosstalk and induced responses, or 3) other genes involved in biotic stress responses such as those involved in hormone-related pathways, secondary metabolism and stress-preventing factors. From these biomarkers, we chose seven representative biomarkers to be followed under field conditions in response to the same treatments. Treated plants were tested for the presence of C. Las using qPCR and showed clear HLB symptoms.</p><p>QRT-PCR analyses were conducted at three to six days after treatment. As expected, we observed no significant changes in pathogen titer. Repeated applications of treatments (at least weekly) should eventually affect the titer. Since we only treated infected trees once, an analysis of pathogen titer after treaments was outside the scope of this study. Long-term studies on the effects of repeated applications of these treatments should test pathogen titer using qPCR.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Atrazine combined with sucrose</title><p>The first small-molecule treatment tested was the combination of sucrose and the herbicide atrazine. Atrazine is a well-known photosystem II inhibitor that affects plant gene expression, seedling physiology, and potentiality impairs protein translation and the ROS defense mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, in combination with sucrose, atrazine induces xenobiotic and ROS signaling. In addition, this treatment upregulated important classes of antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These findings were consistent with our unpublished findings that <italic>glutathione-S-transferases</italic> are upregulated in more tolerant Citrus genotypes.</p><p>Here we observed that atrazine combined with sucrose drastically affected some key genes responsible for HLB-induced carbohydrate changes. Increased sucrose concentrations have been found in in C.

Atrazine upregulated <italic>alpha-amylase</italic>, which was repressed in mature HLB-infected Citrus leaves [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but upregulated in infected Citrus stems [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Taken together, these findings lead us to speculate that atrazine + sucrose might help sucrose degradation by activating <italic>sucrose synthase</italic>. In addition, upregulation of <italic>alpha-amylase</italic> may increase starch degradation in HLB-infected plants where its accumulation is advanced.</p><p>Atrazine (1 &#x003bc;M) combined with sucrose upregulated <italic>WRKY33</italic>. <italic>Brassica napus</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>BnWRKY33</italic> had increased resistance to <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This effect was mediated by SA [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>WRKY33</italic> upregulation allowed resistance to the necrotroph <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Loss of <italic>WRKY33</italic> function induces salicylic acid (SA)-mediated responses, increases salicylic acid and represses jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated responses [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Overall, our results support the hypothesis that this treatment could beneficially modulate key HLB-regulated genes associated with the well-known HLB carbohydrate metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The changes to expression of some key genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism could beneficially modulate the metabolic responses of HLB disease in photosynthesizing Citrus leaves, restoring a more normal source-sink relationship and potentially inhibiting the characteristic and deleterious syndrome in the fruit.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Gibberelllins combined with benzyl adenine treatments</title><p>A mixture of gibberellin (GA3) and 6-benzyladenine (BA) was tested to modulate jasmonic acid-salicylic acid (JA-SA) crosstalk in favor of responses to biotrophs such as C.

Our hypothesis was that gibberellin treatments may activate SAR responses through positive regulation of hormone-mediated crosstalk regulating biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some key genes in hormone-related pathways and JA-SA crosstalk were chosen as indicators of treatment effects.</p><p><italic>MYC2</italic> was significantly induced by both 15 and 30 &#x003bc;M gibberellin treatments. <italic>MYC2</italic> is a transcription factor composed of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that activates and represses specific JA-responsive gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. <italic>MYC2</italic> also induced responses to abiotic stress mediated by abscissic acid in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and suppressed salicylic acid-mediated responses in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Upregulation of <italic>WRKY54</italic> in gibberellin-treated field trees is also interesting because this gene is a positive regulator of resistance against <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, the agent of fire blight in the Rosaceae family.</p><p>The plant immune regulator <italic>EDS1</italic> (Enhanced Disease Susceptibility1) plays a fundamental role in resistance mechanisms to biotrophs and hemi-biotrophs [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The 15 &#x003bc;M GA + BA treatment enhanced EDS1 at six days after treatment in the field. The increase in <italic>EDS1</italic> transcripts after application of these small molecules could help activate SAR response against pathogen infections.

L-arginine positively regulates key genes involved in innate immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0159610.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. L-arginine may act on nitric oxide and directly upregulate key genes in salicylic acid signaling.

As expected, there were no phenotypic changes in response to treatments at one to two months after treatment. Treatment sprays did not cause negative effects such as leaf drop or discoloration. As expected, tree measurements showed almost no differences between treated and untreated trees in field conditions. We believe that beneficial effects are likely to be seen only if treatments are applied frequently before or at the onset of visible HLB symptoms. Here, our aim was to analyze the molecular effects of these treatments on gene expression several days after treatment.
