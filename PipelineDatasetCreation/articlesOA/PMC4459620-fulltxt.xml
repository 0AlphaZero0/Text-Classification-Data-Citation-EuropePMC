Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed across all 16 trials to identify predictors of change in pain score in patients. Trials with a &#x0003e;2-point mean reduction in pain score at endpoint with placebo were designated high placebo response and were compared with low placebo-response trials (those with a &#x02264;2-point mean reduction) with respect to patient and study characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three high placebo-response studies were identified, with all in DPN patients and all conducted postapproval of pregabalin.

Patients with DPN were required to discontinue all analgesic medications.

Separately, trials in which there was a &#x0003e;1.5-point mean change in pain score were compared with those with a &#x02264;1.5-point change. As the placebo response in PHN trials was typically lower than in DPN trials, with no PHN trials having a 2-point mean change, the 1.5-point mean change analysis was conducted in order to compare those PHN trials with a higher response to those with a lower response. A univariate analysis of patient-level data was performed to identify predictors of change in pain score in the placebo group. Categorical variables were analyzed using a chi-square-based method and continuous variables were analyzed using analysis of variance. The relationship between pain scores and secondary efficacy endpoints, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and sleep interference (by 11-point NRS) in the placebo group were also assessed using an initial test of independence (which strongly rejected the hypothesis that being a placebo pain responder was independent of being a PGIC or sleep responder) followed by calculating the probability that a placebo pain responder would also be a PGIC responder and that a placebo pain responder would also be a sleep responder. A multivariate classification and regression-tree analysis of factors potentially contributing to the placebo response in individual patients was also conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Primary efficacy outcomes</title><p>This analysis included 16 studies in which a total of 4,513 patients received &#x02265;1 dose of treatment (2,999 pregabalin and 1,514 placebo).

The other negative study (1008-030) had a low placebo response (change in pain score of &#x02212;0.97) but the pregabalin doses in the actively treated group were low (75 and 150 mg/day).</p><p>Study design and baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients receiving placebo in high placebo-response and low placebo-response studies are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-8-257">Table 3</xref>. High placebo-response compared with low placebo-response studies tended to be of longer duration, to have been conducted postapproval of pregabalin, to have higher ratios of active treatment to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-257">Figure 1A&#x02013;D</xref>), and to include flexible dosing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-257">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>No PHN studies were designated high placebo-response studies; however, there were three PHN studies with a &#x0003e;1.5-point mean reduction in pain score in the placebo arm (1008-155 [PHN patients], A0081004, and A0081081 [PHN patients]). Compared with PHN studies with a lower placebo response, these studies also tended to include patients with a younger mean age (65.8 versus 71.5 years) and shorter mean duration of PHN (24.9 versus 37.4 months). In addition, two of these three studies were conducted postapproval of pregabalin, and all three had an active treatment to placebo ratio &#x02265;2:1 and included a flexible-dosing arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-257">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-257">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The impact of patient age and sex on the change in mean pain score for high and low placebo-response studies is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-8-257">Table 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Predictors of placebo response</title><p>An analysis of univariate predictors of change in pain in pooled placebo arms (across high and low placebo-response studies) is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-jpr-8-257">Table 5</xref> for categorical variables and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-jpr-8-257">Table 6</xref> for continuous variables.

DPN studies with a higher ratio of active treatment to control (&#x02265;2:1) had a higher placebo response than those with lower ratios (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

In contrast, over the same time period, the response to pregabalin (at doses of 300 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and flexible dosing) has not meaningfully changed. Although the placebo response in studies in patients with PHN was typically less than that in patients with DPN, both sets of patients have shown a similar increase in mean placebo response in clinical trials over time.</p><p>A multivariate analysis of factors contributing to placebo response is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jpr-8-257">Figure 3</xref>. The highest placebo response was in patients who did not discontinue from the study due to lack of efficacy, were in a study conducted postapproval, in patients with DPN, with &#x02265;36 sites, and who remained in the study for &#x02265;83.97% of its duration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To elucidate the factors involved in the placebo response, we analyzed the results of 16 trials of pregabalin in which 1,514 patients received placebo (1,038 with DPN and 476 with PHN). The major findings of the study are as follows: high placebo-response compared with low placebo-response studies tended to 1) be conducted postapproval of pregabalin; 2) have higher ratios of active treatment to control; 3) be of longer duration; 4) increase over time; and 5) be associated with changes in other patient-reported outcomes. There was no relationship to site recruitment numbers or time of enrollment in the study, and, contrary to previous reports,<xref rid="b25-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the placebo response was higher in flexible-dose studies.</p><p>The present data strongly support the importance of expectancy on the placebo effect. Awareness that a drug is an approved therapy is likely to enhance patient expectations and all high placebo-response studies in DPN occurred postapproval, whereas two of the three highest placebo-response studies in PHN occurred postapproval. Knowledge of the likelihood of receiving active drug versus placebo also may influence patients&#x02019; expectations. In the trials in this analysis, patients were typically aware of their probability of receiving active treatment versus placebo. Pooled analyses in depression,<xref rid="b26-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> migraine,<xref rid="b27-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and irritable bowel syndrome<xref rid="b28-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> all support an inverse relationship between probability of receiving placebo and placebo response.</p><p>The present data, with drug to placebo ratios varying from 1:1 to 4:1, lend some support to these earlier studies. In univariate analyses of DPN and PHN, a higher treatment allocation ratio was significantly associated with a higher placebo response. In DPN, the lowest pre- and postapproval placebo responses occurred in studies with a 1:1 allocation, whereas the highest preapproval placebo response in PHN occurred in a trial with a 4:1 ratio. The regression-tree analysis demonstrated that approval status, but not treatment allocation ratio, was a predictor of placebo response. It is possible that expectations regarding treatment efficacy carry greater salience for research patients than expectations of treatment allocation, but this analysis is limited by the availability of only two postapproval PHN studies.</p><p>The major determinants of the effect of expectancy on outcome include susceptibility to suggestion, prior experience, learning, cultural perspectives on medical care, investigator&#x02013;patient relationship, and other psychosocial factors.<xref rid="b29-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The present data suggest that to increase assay sensitivity and reduce likelihood of false-negative trials, more attention should be devoted to minimizing expectations in clinical trials. Increased awareness of the role played by verbal suggestions and conscious and unconscious signals conveyed during the course of the trial is necessary. Advocacy for the drug should be avoided, and, particularly in the postapproval environment, recruitment strategies and subject&#x02013;investigator interactions should have an objective, dispassionate quality.</p><p>Consistent with other studies,<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b31-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> our data show that the placebo response is greater in DPN than PHN studies. Earlier reports suggest that anatomical differences may underlie this observation.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These authors theorized that PHN pathology is more likely to involve central sites implicated in the placebo response, such as the descending pain modulatory network.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, other possibilities exist. Greater fluctuations in pain levels in patients with DPN than PHN, in part related to metabolic factors, specifically changes in ambient blood glucose, may act as a conditioning stimulus for the placebo response. Amelioration of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may also underlie spontaneous improvement in the DPN group. Also, opioids were a permitted concomitant medication in the PHN but not DPN trials. Exogenous opioids could antagonize those mechanisms of the placebo response mediated by endogenous opioids.</p><p>Finally, patient characteristics and trial-related factors may be responsible. Substantially more of the DPN studies were conducted postapproval; patients on placebo in DPN studies had a younger mean age (~59 years) than those in PHN studies (~70 years), and DPN studies had a longer mean duration (11.5 and 9.1 weeks for high and low placebo-response studies, respectively) than PHN studies (7.0 weeks). Combined DPN/PHN studies, which in part control for these trial-related factors, yield equivocal results. In one (A0081081), patients with DPN had a higher placebo response than patients with PHN (&#x02212;2.32 versus &#x02212;1.65) over 9 weeks, whereas in the other (1008-155) there was little difference between DPN and PHN (&#x02212;1.78 versus &#x02212;1.86) over 12 weeks.</p><p>Remission may underlie a response in the placebo group, particularly in PHN, a disorder that remits spontaneously, particularly in the first 6 months of the disease. The present data, in which a shorter duration of PHN was associated with a greater placebo response, lend some support to this notion. In these studies, patients with pain present for at least 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash were allowed to enter the trial. These data suggest that extending the duration of pain after the healing of the rash as an entry criterion may help attenuate the placebo response.</p><p>This analysis shows that, over time, there has been a trend towards an increased placebo response in pregabalin trials in DPN and PHN, whereas there has been no corresponding change in the response to pregabalin. Pooled analyses of trials in other patient populations have also noted an increase in placebo response over time.<xref rid="b5-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b26-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b33-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> A meta-analysis of 75 trials in major depressive disorder noted a significant positive association between the proportion of patients responding to placebo and the year of publication (increase in the proportion of patients responding to placebo of approximately 7% per decade between 1981 and 2000).<xref rid="b33-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, a more recent analysis of 96 trials between 1980 and 2005 confirmed the relationship between study year and placebo response with clinician rating but not with patient self-rating scales.<xref rid="b36-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It is not clear why there has been this increase in placebo response over time, but more recent trials tend to be of longer duration and, with clinical trials now being more common, more likely to include younger patients with shorter disease duration. These factors were associated with a greater placebo response in this analysis.</p><p>In the present analysis, a higher baseline pain score was associated with a higher placebo response. This has been observed in other analyses of studies in DPN, fibromyalgia, and depression in which, as with this analysis, both negative and positive studies were included.<xref rid="b5-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b36-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Some recent studies have excluded patients with the highest baseline pain scores (to increase the drug&#x02013;placebo difference).<xref rid="b37-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, inherent to this and other approaches to increase assay sensitivity by excluding placebo is the unresolved question of whether placebo and drug responses are independent, additive, or interactive, and whether excluding those most likely to respond to placebo also excludes those most likely to respond to active treatment.</p><p>There are limitations to this analysis. Only trials of pregabalin were included; therefore, the findings may not be applicable to other interventions. In addition, given the variability in design of the trials included, direct comparisons may not always be appropriate, particularly as only a limited number of the studies analyzed were high placebo-response studies.</p><p>A higher placebo response can limit the ability of a trial to discern a significant treatment effect, resulting in a false-negative, failed trial.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Determination of factors that influence patients&#x02019; responses to placebo may assist in the design of trials that are able to more accurately and sensitively measure a treatment effect. By increasing assay sensitivity, efficacious treatments may be identified more quickly, reducing the number of trials and limiting the exposure of patients to placebo and unproven medications.<xref rid="b7-jpr-8-257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.
