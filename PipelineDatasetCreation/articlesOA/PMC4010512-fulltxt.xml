The prevention requires a high level of lasting actions from the patients, which may be burdensome. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course for general practice nurses in motivation support at 18 months follow-up in the affiliated type 2 diabetes population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Forty general practices with nurse-led diabetes consultations from the area of Aarhus, Denmark were randomised 1&#x02236;1 to either intervention or usual practice. Intervention practices were offered a 16-hour Self-determination theory - based course including communication training for general practice nurses delivered over 10 months. The affiliated diabetes populations (aged 40&#x02013;74 years) were identified from registers (intervention n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2,005; usual n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2,029). Primary outcomes were register-based glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) -, total cholesterol levels, and well-being measured by the Problem Areas In Diabetes scale (PAID) and the mental component summary score, SF12 (SF12, mcs).

Evidence on the prevention of these complications suggest both poly-pharmacological treatment including glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering and blood pressure lowering treatment and health behaviour including non-smoking, healthy diet and physical activity <xref rid="pone.0096683-Ryden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The prevention of the complications requires a high level of lasting actions from the patients, which may be perceived as demanding by the patients, and lead to emotional distress. How health care providers support the patients living with the chronic disease is therefore essential.</p><p>In Danish healthcare, as in many other countries, type 2 diabetes care is provided by general practice in the framework of one annual 30 minute &#x02013; and three quarterly 15 minutes consultations. In 2009, a growing share of the diabetes care was delegated from general practitioners to nurses employed in the practices (GP nurses) <xref rid="pone.0096683-Juul1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We therefore established a training course aiming to improve the contents in the nurse-led diabetes consultations within the framework of current type 2 diabetes care and for the benefits of the patients with type 2 diabetes. In the development of the training course, we addressed the huge challenge it is for health care providers to adhere to the treatment guidelines and also support the patients&#x02019; motivation for the recommendations, and support their well-being. Self-determination Theory (SDT) was chosen as the underlying theory for our intervention <xref rid="pone.0096683-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. SDT proposes both a patient-centred approach with the main focus on the underlying reasons for motivation for actions, and a high emphasis on the importance of adequate information from the health care providers. SDT was well supported by observational studies where core elements of the theory; autonomy support and autonomous motivation were found associated with higher quality of life and better clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0096683-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096683-Williams3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, an explanatory trial in a Danish diabetes outpatient clinic supported the theory <xref rid="pone.0096683-Zoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; but, documentation of the effect of applying SDT in current type 2 diabetes care in general practice was lacking. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course for GP nurses in applying SDT in current type 2 diabetes care on glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>)-, total cholesterol levels and well-being in the diabetes population at an 18-month follow-up. We expected that the intervention would enhance autonomous motivation in the patients with type 2 diabetes; which would improve their well-being and maintain their motivation for health behaviour changes; which again would reduce their risk profile regarding complications indicated by HbA<sub>1c</sub>- and total cholesterol levels. We expected that the patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of education level, gender or age would benefit from the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design, Setting and Study Population</title><p>A cluster-randomised pragmatic trial including 40 general practices with nurse-led type 2 diabetes consultations was conducted in the area of Aarhus, Denmark.

Two reminders were sent three weeks apart, and the questionnaires were completed 16&#x02013;18 months after the core intervention. The register-based blood test data and the questionnaires were pooled by using the unique civil registry number assigned to all Danish citizens. Furthermore, the data were linked to social data (education, ethnicity, cohabitation) from Statistics Denmark. The following categorisation of data was used; educational level: &#x02264;10 years of education or &#x0003e;10 years of education, ethnicity: Danish background or immigrant, cohabitation: living together with spouse/partner or living alone, and age: &#x0003c;60 years or &#x02265;60 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Process Data</title><p>Eleven months after the core intervention, an evaluation questionnaire was sent to all the nurses who partly or fully completed the course.

HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol baseline values were the average of the values measured within the last 12 months before course start. The follow-up values were the average of the values measured during the &#x0201c;observational window&#x0201d; 15&#x02013;21 months after the core intervention. Thus, the average follow-up time was 18 months. The effectiveness of the intervention on HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol levels were estimated by the differences between the diabetes populations in the intervention practices and the usual practices with regard to 1) mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol, and 2) proportions with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8%, and proportions with total cholesterol &#x02265;5 mmol/l at follow-up. The differences in mean at follow-up were estimated based on a mixed additive model where adjustments were made for baseline values and random differences between general practices (STATA 12 xtmixed), e.g. analyses were adjusting for clustering within general practices. Furthermore, the differences were adjusted for age (as continuous variable), gender, ethnicity, educational level, cohabitation, and redeemed diabetes medication in the baseline period. The differences in the proportions of patients with a follow-up HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% and the proportions with a follow-up total cholesterol &#x02265;5 mmol/l were estimated based on mixed additive models that adjusted for baseline status (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8% and total cholesterol &#x02265;5 mmol/l respectively) and random differences between general practices (SAS 9.3 nlmixed).</p><p>The sum scores for the questionnaire scales were calculated where no item-response was missing. Due to a non-normal distributed data, even after log transformation, the sum scores were presented as medians with quartiles. The hypothesis of no difference between medians was tested by a permutations test using general practices as permutation units, 1,000 simulations and the absolute difference in medians as criteria (STATA 12). Confidence intervals for the difference of two medians were found using two-level bootstrapping by resampling general practices and patients within general practice using 1,000 bootstrap samples (STATA 12). Hence, the differences of the medians were also adjusted for clustering.</p><p>Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to age, gender and educational level.</p><p>Results were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values. P values of &#x0003c;0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.</p><p>Non-responder analyses were performed for age, gender, educational level, cohabitation and ethnicity by chi<sub>2</sub>-test and by multiple regression analyses.</p><p>Regarding the nurse questionnaire data, for each autonomy supportive competence, the number of nurses was counted for the scores from 1&#x02013;10 (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;rarely, 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;always), before and 11 months after the training course.

The difference in mean total cholesterol between the randomisation groups was 0.08 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.15) at follow-up, which favoured usual practice. However, the mean total cholesterol values were below the recommended threshold (4.5 mmol/l) in both groups at follow-up. Furthermore, a higher proportion of the diabetes population had a follow-up total cholesterol measurement in the intervention practices compared with the usual practices, and the patients without a follow-up measurement had higher levels of baseline total cholesterol than those with a follow-up measurement.</p><p>The predefined subgroup analyses showed small, but statistically significant differences in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> and self-reported mental health in favour of the intervention among the women. Power calculation was not performed regarding the subgroup analyses. However, the precision of the results are shown by 95% CIs. Regarding the difference in the median scores of mcs, SF12, the 95% CI indicated that the difference could be &#x0003c;0.The discrepancy between the significance testing and the confidence interval for the observed difference can appear when using different methods with different assumptions.</p><p>The evaluation of the educational process showed that 70% of the nurses who completed the questionnaire perceived that their autonomy supportive skills had improved, especially their communication skills. The process evaluation also showed that implementation of the patient work- sheets was incomplete.</p><p>The method Motivational interviewing (MI) has been assumed to be largely in accordance with SDT <xref rid="pone.0096683-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and comparisons with MI interventions in diabetes care are performed in the following. Heinrich E et al. conducted a highly pragmatic trial similar to ours aiming to embed improved communication skills into daily general practice through a MI-based training course for GP nurses <xref rid="pone.0096683-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This intervention showed improved effects on locus of control and knowledge in volunteers with type 2 diabetes, but it also showed adverse effects on fat intake and HDL-cholesterol. No effects were found on multiple outcome measures including HbA<sub>1c</sub>, total cholesterol and quality of life. Henrich et al. found that their results could partly be explained by a too low training intensity of the nurses and limited time for interaction with patients within the framework of existing diabetes care.</p><p>Explanatory trials evaluating SDT-based interventions in diabetes care have shown varying results. Recently, a one-year MI programme was evaluated in a Danish diabetes clinic setting including volunteers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0096683-RosenbekMinet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although the study did accomplish a rise in health care providers&#x02019; MI competences and a high degree of intervention delivery, the study showed no 12- or 24-month effect on PAID or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. A high level of usual care including a patient education programme based on Guided Self-Determination may explain the absence of differences between the randomisation groups. The approach in Guided Self-Determination is consistent with SDT and has as previously mentioned, shown an effect in diabetes care <xref rid="pone.0096683-Zoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>None of the above-mentioned studies have investigated the gender differential effect of the interventions. West, et al. investigated the effect of adding five individual MI sessions to a group-based behavioural obesity treatment programme for overweight women with type 2 diabetes and reported an effect on weight loss and a decline in HbA<sub>1c</sub>

A quality of the present trial is that the basis of the intervention components and all activities are well-described <xref rid="pone.0096683-Juul2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The near-complete coverage of Danish registers allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness in a comprehensive diabetes population. A limitation of the registers is the inability to distinguish between types of diabetes. However, the number of patients with type 2 diabetes far exceeds the number of patients with type 1 diabetes (85%&#x02236;15%), and there should be no reason to assume an unequal distribution between the intervention and the usual practice group. The inclusion of the type 1 diabetes population may however, have contributed to a dilution of a potential effect of the intervention because type 1 diabetes care is primarily delivered by out-patient clinics. For example, the found differences of &#x02212;0.12%-points in HbA1c and of 2.6 score-points on the 0-100-SF12, mcs scale in our female population could be biased towards the null-hypothesis due to dilution because of the inclusion of the very comprehensive diabetes population.</p><p>Our recruitment strategy of the general practices was a realistic scenario for future training courses. A previous study showed that the eligible practices for the present trial were associated with a higher quality of diabetes management when compared with practices with no nurse(s) employed and also when compared with practices that did not respond to that survey <xref rid="pone.0096683-Juul1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This indicates less room for improvement and a higher level of engagement in diabetes management in the included practices. The lack of knowledge about the activities performed in usual practice is a limitation of our study. The allocation to the usual practice group may have tempted the nurses in the usual practices to join courses similar to the one offered in the intervention practices. On the other hand, each contact to the usual practices could have enhanced focus on communication and provoked that they stopped being &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0096683-Smelt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>We used different types of patient outcomes to measure different stages in the expected process from motivation support to improved well-being and changed clinical outcomes. This could speak for multiplicity correction, but because different models and methods were required for the analyses of the outcome measures, a test of no effect based on correlated outcomes was infeasible.</p><p>Well-being is directly relevant for the patients, but the questionnaire scales&#x02019; sensitivity to detect differences caused by interventions is not clear. The ceiling effects in the motivational outcome measures; the SDT scores and the low levels of the PAID-scores showed very little room for improvement.</p><p>Avoiding complications is highly relevant for the patients and the HbA<sub>1c</sub> - and cholesterol levels are valid surrogates for the development of complications <xref rid="pone.0096683-Ryden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is also evident that health behavioural treatment such as physical activity, diet and medication adherence impacts HbA<sub>1c</sub> and cholesterol values <xref rid="pone.0096683-Ryden1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but we had no valid information on these aspects for this study. Hence, we decided to use HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol measurements as indicators of some occurrence of the guideline recommendations. However, the duration of the follow-up may have been too short to detect a difference in these outcomes. This in particular, because we evaluated the effect under real-life conditions and therefore e.g. made no attempt to ensure the patients&#x02019; participation in a diabetes consultation provided by the nurse at certain times during the follow-up time <xref rid="pone.0096683-Thorpe1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096683-Patsopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A total of 69% of the questionnaire responders reported they had attended a nurse-led diabetes consultation during the follow-up time.</p><p>Whether the current framework of approximately 15 minutes quarterly consultations is adequate for the nurses to sufficiently stimulate the patients&#x02019; process of being autonomously motivated could be debatable. A Swedish intervention included besides 1) training of primary care nurses to put more emphasis on the patients&#x02019; understanding of their disease in the current framework of diabetes care, also 2) a comprehensive nine months programme with 20 hours of reflective group-discussions on living with diabetes. This explanatory trial showed an intervention effect in terms of statistically significant lower HbA1c-levels in the intervention group compared with the control group after one year (&#x02212;0.94%-points) and after five years (&#x02212;1.34%-points) <xref rid="pone.0096683-Hornsten1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096683-Hornsten2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The present trial was not designed to evaluate whether the training course would work under ideal circumstances. As expected under normal, real-life conditions, not all the intervention practices participated in all or even in parts of the course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096683-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This kind of &#x0201c;non-compliance&#x0201d; is included in the real-life effect <xref rid="pone.0096683-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Obtaining data on implementation issues could be an intervention component that induces an effect in itself and will not be included in the future intervention <xref rid="pone.0096683-Zwarenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we did not e.g. observe whether the training course succeeded in improving the nurses&#x02019; autonomy supportive competences in the diabetes consultations. However, the participating nurses completed an evaluation questionnaire, which we assumed would be realistic for the future. A total of 70% of the nurses who completed the evaluation questionnaire, reported perceived improvement in at least three of the autonomy supportive competences. This kind of information is potentially biased, but it does however give a picture of the nurses&#x02019; perceived benefits.</p><p>The underlying assumptions behind sample size calculation of a cluster randomised pragmatic trial like ours can be discussed, e.g. the ICC and the effect size in use <xref rid="pone.0096683-Donner1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Likewise, other methods could have been used for the sample size calculation <xref rid="pone.0096683-Heo1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It should be noticed, that we enrolled more general practices and patients than suggested by our power calculation; there was a lot of interest among the practices for participating in the study and it turned out that there was much more patients with diabetes associated with the practices than expected. We report all estimated effect with confidence intervals adjusted for the clustering of the data. The confidence intervals on the primary outcome HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol are narrow and they all show that if effectiveness of the intervention exists, then it is small. However, it could be argued that even small effect sizes found at the diabetes population level in this pragmatic trial design could be worthwhile because of the low intervention costs. The costs of this intervention solely comprised the costs of the education of the nurses because the intervention was delivered to the patients in the framework of existing diabetes care and thereby without additional expenditure. The magnitude of relevant effect sizes seen in relation to intervention costs deserves more attention in the planning of future interventions evaluated in pragmatic trial designs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Offering a training course for GP nurses in applying SDT in current type 2 diabetes care had no effect compared with usual practice measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub> and total cholesterol levels and well-being at an 18 month follow-up in a comprehensive register-based diabetes population.
