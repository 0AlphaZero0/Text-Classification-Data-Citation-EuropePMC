<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thrombosis persists as a leading cause of death and incapacity worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The formation of thrombosis is a very complex pathological process involving the platelets and blood coagulation components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thrombin plays a vital role in blood coagulation by promoting platelet aggregation and by converting fibrinogen to form the fibrin clot in the final step of the coagulation cascade [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thrombin is composed of two polypeptide chains of 36 (A chain) and 259 (B chain) residues that are covalently linked through a disulfide bond, and the B chain carries the functional epitopes of the enzyme [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As same as all chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, thrombin has a conserved active centre located inside the molecule and contains amino acid residues of HIS57, ASP102, and SER195, which are called the catalytic triad [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Except for its active centre, thrombin possesses two exosites (1 and 2), positively charged domains located at opposite poles of the enzyme, among them, exosite 1 is utilized to dock on the substrates such as fibrinogen, and exosite 2 serves as the heparin-binding domain [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The current antithrombotic therapies include heparin (unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins), fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonists, factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), such as argatroban, dabigatran, lepirudin, desirudin, and bivalirudin, which bind to thrombin and block its enzymatic activity, are widely and effectively used in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases; however, dabigatran is not orally available due to its high polarity [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, dabigatran etexilate as prodrug was developed to facilitate gastrointestinal absorption by adding an ethyl group at the carboxylic acid group and a hexyloxycarbonyl side chain at the amidine group [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Compared with heparins, DTIs do not require antithrombin as a cofactor and do not bind to plasma proteins; therefore, they produce a more predictable anticoagulant effect, and variability of patient response is low relative to other drug classes [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In reality, they still present limitations such as a narrow therapeutic window, and bleeding and anaphylaxis as side effects [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, alternative antithrombotic therapies are under extensive investigation, and many entities from natural products are being isolated and studied to counteract these side effects [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Liu et al. [12] evaluated a series of natural flavonoids as potential thrombin inhibitors by optimized method of thrombin time and found that myricetin and quercetin were the best thrombin inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Bijak et al. [4] showed that cyanidin, quercetin, and silybin changed thrombin proteolytic activity, while cyanidin and quercetin caused a strong response in the interaction with immobilized thrombin by BIAcore analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Thus, their results suggested that polyphenolic compounds might be potential structural bases and source to find and project nature-based, safe, orally bioavailable direct thrombin inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the receptor concept, drugs produce their therapeutic effects via interactions with the targets [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, evaluation of the interaction between thrombin and phenolic compounds is important for studying of drug action mechanism and drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) is one of the predominant methods for interaction studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Comparing with traditional methods such as equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, liquid chromatography, spectroscopic methods (UV-visible, fluorescence, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, optical rotatory dispersion, and circular dichroism), and isothermal titration calorimetry [14], ACE has lots of advantages including high separation efficiency, short analysis duration, low sample and reagent volumes, low purity requirement, ease of automation, and the ability to work under near-physiological conditions [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>At present, ACE had usually been applied in evaluating the noncovalent interaction between protein and ligands [15–17] or cell and ligands [13, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, in silico molecular docking had recently been presented as an assistant technology to obtain information about the interactions between thrombin and small molecules [19–21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between thrombin and phenolic compounds including p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, dihydroquercetin, naringenin, apigenin, and baicalein (the chemical structures of the investigated compounds are presented in Figure 1) by ACE and in silico molecular docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Firstly, ACE was used to calculate the binding constants (K b) of the interactions between thrombin and phenolic compounds in experimental environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Then, in silico molecular docking as assistant technology was also utilized to further explore the interactions between phenolic compounds and thrombin, including the binding sites and positioning of the ligand into the binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Finally, the interaction of compounds with enzyme activity centre, which might be potential thrombin inhibitors, could be obtained by the results of ACE and molecular docking. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>A schematic diagram of calculating K b is shown in Figure 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In ACE, K b can be determined from the variation of mobility shifts of the sample at running buffer containing different concentrations of thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The binding constant K b could be calculated by the Scatchard equation [22] as follows:(1)  μi−μfL=−Kbμi−μf+Kbμc−μf,where K b is the binding constant, [L] is the equilibrium concentration of uncomplexed ligand, μ f and μ c are the electrophoretic mobility of free and complexed solute, and μ i is the solute mobility measured at ligand concentration [L]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In this work, the mobility ratio M was inducted to eliminate the effects of the variation of running buffer, as defined in the following equation:(2)M=μnetμeo=μμeo+1=lcld/Vtlcld/Vteo+1=teot+1,where l c is the total length of the capillary, l d is the effective length of the capillary, μ net is the net mobility measured for the solute, μ eo is the mobility due to EOF, μ is the inherent mobility of the solute, t is the measured analyte migration time, t eo is the migration time of the neutral marker, and V is the operating voltage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Analysis that can be performed using M is thus independent of the capillary length and voltage; the expression depends solely on the migration time of the phenolic compound relative to acetone. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The molecular dockings were conducted by using the crystal structure of the thrombin-argatroban complex (PDB ID = 1DWC) at 1.53 Å resolution [24], where the ligand argatroban was deleted using UCSF Chimera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Besides, polar hydrogen atoms were added, and the crystal water was remained. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>ACE Analysis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Through preliminary investigation of thrombin concentration in running buffer, the six suitable concentrations were arranged as 0 U/mL, 0.4 U/mL, 0.8 U/mL, 1.2 U/mL, 1.6 U/mL, and 2.0 U/mL for ACE analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Considering about some flavonoid compounds were sparingly soluble in buffer at pH 7.4, and the activity of thrombin presents a maximum around pH 9.5 [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pH 9.0 of running buffer was used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>It was attempted to calculate the K b value of argatroban and thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>However, the migration time of argatroban was same as argatroban-thrombin complex which did not meet the basic requirement of the ACE method [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>So the K b value of interaction between argatroban and thrombin could not be obtained in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Baicalein as sample containing 5% (v/v) acetone was analyzed in running buffer at six concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 3, the migration of acetone delayed due to the effect of the variation of running buffer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>But the introduced mobility ratio eliminated the error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Then, the binding constant was calculated by the variation of mobility shifts of baicalein at running buffer containing different concentrations of thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The K b values of other compounds were calculated by the same procedure (electrophoregrams of other compounds were provided in Supplementary Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The migration time of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid delayed, and mobility ratio became smaller with increasing the thrombin concentration in running buffer which indicated that thrombin had interaction with them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, there was no nonlinear correlation between (M f − M i)/[L] and (M f − M i). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>According to the previous study [26], the binding modes of small molecules and biomacromolecules include site-specific and nonspecific binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the K b value could only be calculated by the Scatchard equation when the site-specific binding mode was dominant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the reason of K b value of interaction of thrombin and p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid could not be obtained in this study might be that the site-specific binding force was weak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The other phenolic compounds had relative stronger affinity with thrombin, and the K b values are shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In general, the affinities of thrombin binding with flavonoids were stronger than phenolic acids according to the K b values obtained by ACE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Gallic acid possessed more OH group than other three phenolic acid compounds (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid), which may relate to its stronger affinity with thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Compared with the K b values of other flavonoid compounds, baicalein had the strongest affinity with thrombin, which is possibly contributed to the existence of three OH groups (5th, 6th, and 7th positions) at A-ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Liu et al. [12] demonstrated that more OH groups in the A-ring will increase thrombin inhibition activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Previous reported results also indicated that hydroxyl groups at C-3′ and C-4′ positions in the B-ring and hydroxyl group at C-3 position in the C-ring played key roles in the thrombin inhibitory activity [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>And the present results of ACE showed that naringenin had the lowest affinity with thrombin due to lack of OH groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>According to the calculated K b values of naringenin and apigenin, the presence of C2=C3 was also important for the affinity with thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Additionally, spatial structure difference could result in different binding strength to thrombin such as catechin and epicatechin. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The essence of molecular docking was a recognition process of two or more molecules, involving the space and energy matching between them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The major tasks of the docking procedure were characterization of the binding site, positioning of the ligand into the binding site, and evaluating the strength of interaction for a specific ligand-receptor complex [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The semiflexible docking was applied in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In the docking, the thrombin conformation kept constant, but the compound conformation could change slightly to get the most stable phenolic compound-thrombin complex also called optimal conformation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Clustering the docking conformations of thrombin-phenolic acid complexes, the result showed that their optimal conformation was not present in the activity centre, meaning that the four phenolic acid compounds could bind with other place of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study only discussed the docking results of thrombin and flavonoid compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The 2D interaction diagram of baicalein with residues of thrombin can be observed in Figure 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Three OH groups (5th, 6th, and 7th positions) at A-ring of baicalein have interaction with ASP189 and SER214 of thrombin by hydrogen bonds which are marked by deep green dotted lines on the 2D interaction diagram. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The 2D interaction diagrams of other compounds with residues of thrombin are shown in Supplementary Figure S2, and the docking results and residue interactions are demonstrated in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>It was recognized that the region with binding energy below −5.0 kcal/mol could be regarded as the “Potential Targets” [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The docking results showed that the binding energies of six flavonoid compounds were similar and below −7.0 kcal/mol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation is that their highly similar structures lead to the approximate docking results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Therefore, all of six compounds had relative strong affinity with thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In addition, the binding positions of six flavonoid compounds were alike with argatroban as shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>It is worth mentioning that all of them located in the activity centre and had interaction with the residue HIS57 or SER195, which indicated that these compounds likely had thrombin inhibitory activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In this work, quick and simple methods (ACE and in silico molecular docking) were developed to investigate the interactions between thrombin and ten phenolic compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>As compared with conventional methods for interaction study, combination of ACE and molecular docking could greatly decrease the analyses time and sample consumption, and the mechanisms of drug effect could be explained by specific interaction with residues of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results of interaction study in actual (experimental) and simulation environment are mutually complementary or verified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The results of present study indicated that the interactions between thrombin and phenolic acids were weak except for gallic acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in docking results, phenolic acids could only interact with residues other than activity centre due to lack of space matching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>So these phenolic acids (except gallic acid) possibly have not thrombin inhibition effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The calculated K b values by ACE in actual environment indicated that gallic acid and six flavonoid compounds had relative strong affinity with thrombin, and the affinity was positively correlated with the number of OH groups in A-ring specially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OH groups at C-3′ and C-4′ position in the B-ring and OH group at C-3 position in the C-ring, and the presence of C2=C3 also played key roles for the interaction with thrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The docking results showed that all of optimal conformations of the investigated flavonoid compounds were positioned into the thrombin activity centre and had interactions with HIS57 or SER195, which indicated that these flavonoids possibly had the thrombin inhibition activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In a word, combination of ACE and molecular docking is an effective approach for studying the interaction between thrombin and small molecules, and characterizing of the binding site, which is an important process for drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
