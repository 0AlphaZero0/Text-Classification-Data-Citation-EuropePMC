<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) (also known as the Ashwell receptor) mediates the capture and endocytosis of galactose- (Gal) and N-acetylgalactosamine- (GalNAc) terminating glycoproteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The relevance of this function has been the subject of much debate; the primary role may be the removal of potentially hazardous glycoconjugates arising from normal tissue turnover, tissue injury, disease, and other causes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Studies using knock-out mice have provided evidence for direct involvement of the ASGPR in removal of abnormally sialylated plasma glycoproteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking the sialyltransferase ST3Gal4 showed prolonged bleeding which was attributed to ASGPR-mediated clearance of at least one plasma hemostatic component, von Willebrand factor (VWF), that showed decreased sialylation [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Findings in mice lacking the ASGPR demonstrated that, during sepsis, the receptor removed components of hemostasis (VWF and platelets) that had been desialylated by bacterial neuraminidase and thereby allowed hemostatic adaptation that moderated disseminated intravascular coagulation and improved host survival [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The ASGPR may therefore be poised for rapid clearance of plasma glycoproteins that, for whatever reason, show decreased or abnormal sialylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The highest level of expression of the ASGPR is in the liver, in which it is located on the sinusoidal face of hepatocytes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Low-level expression has been shown in various other cell types, such as, peritoneal macrophages in rat [5], human intestinal epithelial cells [6], mouse testis [7], and the rat thyroid gland [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The role of the receptor at these extrahepatic sites is uncertain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The galactosyl homeostasis theory proposes that the balance of both Gal and GalNAc glycoconjugates is important for normal tissue physiology [1, 9]; whether or not expression of the ASGPR at these other sites represents a need for localized constitutive control of such glycoconjugates is not known. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A major area of interest focussing on the ASGPR is the targeted gene transfer/delivery of drugs to the liver [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, using GalNAc as a ligand on a siRNA-containing complex, the latter was successfully targeted to hepatocytes after simple intravenous injection into the tail vein in mice [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, siRNA-mediated knock-down of targeted genes was demonstrated within the hepatocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Besides its potential importance in allowing liver-specific drug targeting [12], the ASGPR is a key factor in the design and administration of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals more generally: the activity of the receptor can impact upon drug half life and thereby the window of therapeutic efficacy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Human ASGPR is composed of two types of subunit: a major subunit (asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, ASGR1) and minor subunit (asialoglycoprotein receptor 2, ASGR2) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Both subunits are type II, single pass proteins that broadly comprise a cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The subunits may exist as ASGR1-ASGR2 heterooligomers, ASGR1homotrimers and homotetramers, and ASGR2 homodimers and homotetramers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These different quaternary forms may allow for functional differences, such as, substrate specificity or rate of endocytosis [1, 16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding ASGR1 and ASGR2 (ASGR1 and ASGR2, resp.) are located on the short arm of autosome 17, approximately 58.6 kilobases (kb) apart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The genes are evolutionarily related but differ significantly in their structural organization: ASGR1 comprises 8 exons and is approximately 6 kb long, ASGR2 contains 9 exons occupying 13.5 kb of DNA [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Until recently, ASGR1 was thought to yield one transcript encoding a single protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, in 2010, Liu et al. demonstrated the existence of two alternatively spliced transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The longer transcript, T1, contains all 8 exons and is by far the more abundant; it encodes full-length ASGR1 (isoform a, 291 aminoacids). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The shorter transcript, T2, has an in-frame deletion of exon 3 resulting in the loss of 39 residues (isoform b, 252 amino acids). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Isoform b lacks the transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>ASGR2 gives rise to five transcripts (TH2′, T1, T2, T3, and T4) encoding four isoforms (a to d) that contain different in-frame deletions arising from alternative exon splicing events [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Isoforms a and c contain 5 aminoacids that serve as a proteolysis cleavage signal near the junction between the transmembrane domain and the CRD [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Cleavage at this site results in secretion of the CRD as a soluble protein [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Isoforms b and d lack this signal therefore they are not proteolytically cleaved but rather remain membrane bound where they may oligomerize with ASGR1 isoform a to form native ASGPR at the cell surface. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The secreted forms of ASGR1 and ASGR2 are able to associate into soluble ASGPR [17, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>There is evidence to suggest that the soluble receptor may bind free substrates in the circulation and carry them to the liver for uptake and degradation [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Aside from membrane attachment/secretion, it is not known whether further functional variation, such as, substrate specificity, may be associated with the different isoforms of ASGR1 and ASGR2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation above that the ASGPR is expressed in rat peritoneal macrophages, it was considered possible that monocytes, the lineage precursor of tissue macrophages, may also express the receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported in human monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the expression of ASGR1 and ASGR2 in human peripheral blood monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The data showed that both ASGR1 and ASGR2 are expressed in human monocytes in the circulation, that expression cannot be detected in lymphocytes and granulocytes, that the transcripts of both genes differ between individuals and that, in a given individual, the transcription profile for ASGR2 is restricted to one of two patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The findings are of potential importance for health and disease in a variety of disciplines. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR of RNA extracted from PBMCs demonstrated the presence of both ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts (Figure 2(a)). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Following these initial findings, PBMCs were fractionated in order to localize the cells in which ASGR1 and ASGR2 expression was present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Histopaque gradients allowed separation of cells into monocytes + lymphocytes (M + L) and granulocytes + lymphocytes (G + L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>These cell preparations typically contained 10% monocytes/90% lymphocytes (M + L) and 94% granulocytes/10% lymphocytes (G + L) (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR, ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts were detected in RNA from the M + L fraction but not in RNA from the G + L fraction (Figure 2(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>These findings were reproducible for blood samples taken from 3 different individuals (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The G + L fraction did not yield a product for the transcripts even after 50 cycles of RT-PCR amplification (Figure 2(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Some nonspecific products were obtained as a result of this high number of cycles; however, these did not interfere with the main result of the experiment (Figure 2(b)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Because lymphocytes were common to both cell fractions, and because the G + L fraction was reproducibly negative for ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts, the data suggested that expression of the two genes was localized to monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>To confirm this, monocytes and lymphocytes were formally cell sorted using flow cytometry, RNA extracted and screened using RT-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Monocytes gave a positive result for both ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts, whilst lymphocytes did not give a PCR product, even after 50 cycles of amplification (Figure 2(c)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This high cycle number resulted in the burst-through of some nonspecific products; however, these did not interfere with the interpretation (Figure 2(c)). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The longer transcript (T1) encodes isoform a (full-length ASGR1), the shorter transcript (T2) has an in-frame deletion of 117 nucleotides in the coding sequence resulting in a shorter isoform (isoform b) (Figure 1(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The latter lacks the transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the liver, T1 has been shown to be the predominant isoform, with very little T2 detectable [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Using a nested PCR approach to screen RNA from the M + L cell fraction of peripheral blood, different individuals showed the presence of either T1 or of both T1 and T2 (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In combination with the data in Figure 2 (which showed that ASGR1 transcripts are detected in monocytes and not lymphocytes), these data suggest that the monocyte transcription profile for ASGR1 differs between individuals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression of ASGR1 and ASGR2 was demonstrated in peripheral blood monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>For both genes, transcript profiles were obtained that corresponded with known splice variants found in the liver. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the expression of correctly processed transcripts of ASGR1 and ASGR2 by human monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In rat, a transcript encoding an asialoglycoprotein-binding protein was isolated from a peritoneal macrophage cDNA library and was highly homologous to that of the rodent hepatic ASGPR [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The data were interpreted to indicate that the rodent macrophage asialoglycoprotein-binding protein and the liver ASGPR were encoded by related genes [5]; however, it now seems possible that alternative splicing may underlie the differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study do not suggest expression of alternative ASGPR-related genes in monocytes, rather they are entirely consistent with transcription of ASGR1 and ASGR2, as occurs in the liver. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The various transcripts of ASGR1 and ASGR2 encode different isoforms of the proteins (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether the isoforms differ in their specificity or functionality, however it is predicted that certain isoforms have the potential to give rise to soluble forms of each protein. ASGR1 transcript T2 has an in-frame deletion of 117 bp that encode the transmembrane domain; the resulting isoform “b” therefore is soluble and secreted [17]. ASGR2 transcripts T1, TH2′ and T3 encode isoforms “a” (T1 and TH2') and “c” (T3) which contain a proteolysis signal that, upon cleavage, gives rise to soluble protein [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Transcripts T2 and T4, respectively, encode isoforms b and d which lack the proteolysis signal and are membrane bound. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The data presented here indicate that monocytes are able to express transcripts encoding soluble and membrane-bound isoforms of the ASGPR proteins. ASGR2 was found to give rise to two transcript profiles, only one of which was present in the monocytes from any given individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>One profile corresponded with transcripts encoding both soluble and membrane-bound ASGR2 isoforms (a, b, c, and d), the other with membrane-bound ASGR2 isoforms (b and d) only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This novel finding indicates a fundamental difference between individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The underlying basis for this and whether or not it has physiologic significance in health or disease merit further exploration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The level of ASGR1 and ASGR2 expression was considerably less in monocytes and the monocyte cell line THP1 compared with the liver cell line HepG2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>It should be borne in mind that HepG2 expresses high levels of the receptor [24] and the monocyte expression was relative to this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>That monocyte transcripts were not rare within the cells was indicated by the fact that they were readily detected using RT-PCR at routine cycle numbers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Low level of expression of the ASGPR has been reported previously in certain nonhepatic tissues (rat macrophages [5], human intestinal epithelial cells [6], mouse testis [7], and rat thyroid gland [8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>It would be relevant to explore whether ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcription alters upon monocyte activation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The relative expression of ASGR1 and ASGR2 in monocytes and THP1 (1 : 100) differed notably from ratios reported in liver (1 : 2 [1] and 1 : 6 [16]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The difference may be real, or it may reflect differences in methodology between studies or possibly a difference in the amplification efficiency of the primer pair used for ASGR1 compared with that used for ASGR2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The true relative expression of the two genes by monocytes therefore remains to be established. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>An important question arising from these results is whether monocytes translate ASGR1 and ASGR2 transcripts and produce functional ASGPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The restricted expression of the genes in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes or granulocytes, suggests the transcripts are not produced randomly but specifically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Based on the fundamental principles of biology, this is likely to be for translation, it is difficult to think why else different transcripts encoding different isoforms may be produced by one specific cell type in the blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The restricted tissue specificity for ASGPR expression in the body, and the lower expression level observed at the nonhepatic locations, could signal a specific role or function at those sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In the case of monocytes, the receptor could, at the very least, serve a scavenger function where there is infection or tissue injury. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Expression of correctly processed transcripts of ASGR1 and ASGR2 by circulating monocytes has potentially significant implications in several important areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>These can be grouped into two main themes: normal physiology and drug design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>If monocytes express functional ASGPR, they may contribute towards the normal physiological processes undertaken by the hepatocyte receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Whilst hepatocyte ASGPR is localized to the liver and relies upon the circulation to deliver ligands to it, the monocyte receptor would represent a mobile pool that can reach ligands in most parts of the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Monocyte ASGPR may additionally interact with ligands in the blood, as does liver ASGPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Thus, the monocyte receptor, if it is produced, may overlap functionally with that of the liver but may have additional physiological roles elsewhere in the body. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Hepatic ASGPR has been shown to be directly involved in the normal turnover of an important protein of primary hemostasis, VWF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Studies in knock-out mice indicated that the ASGPR is engaged in the constitutive control of VWF level and can, additionally, remove hemostatic components (VWF and platelets) desialylated by bacterial neuraminidase, a possible survival mechanism in disseminated intravascular coagulation [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The results in these studies were ascribed to the activity of the liver receptor; however, our data raise the possibility that monocytes may contribute to the relevant physiological processes via the ASGPR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The findings have implications for the design of drugs targeting the liver via the ASGPR and drugs that are cleared by this receptor [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Various strategies have been used, for example, conjugation of drug with galactosyl terminating molecules, as has been done with antiviral nucleoside analogues in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Besides drug targeting, strategies to deliver genes or other nucleic acids to the liver have also made use of the ASGPR [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Relatively recently, successful in vivo delivery of siRNAs to the liver in mice has been achieved via simple intravenous injection employing ASGPR-specific conjugates containing GalNAc [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological targeting of the ASGPR could not be considered to be predominantly liver-specific if monocytes express the receptor. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>ASGR1 and ASGR2 are expressed in peripheral blood monocytes in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>For both genes, monocytes have the ability to produce correctly spliced transcripts encoding each of the known protein isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>However, there are interindividual differences in the transcript profiles; of particular note, despite several possible ASGR2 transcripts, just two combinations were found to occur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This observation indicates that, in any given individual, ASGR2 mRNA splicing is restricted to one of two profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Quantitative studies indicate that expression of both ASGR1 and ASGR2 is lower in monocytes than in the liver, but none-the-less is readily detected in monocytes (in comparison to other blood cells in which expression could not be demonstrated). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The liver may represent a static site to which blood carries glycoconjugates for ASGPR-mediated removal, whilst monocytes may represent a mobile pool that can reach sites where the activity of the receptor is needed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The data presented here open various important avenues for future research, a notable one of which is the measurement and characterization of monocyte ASGPR protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The results for the cell line THP1 indicated it could be used as a model system for the investigation of monocyte ASPGR function and activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Monocytes play a pivotal role in inflammation and immunity, the finding of ASGPR transcripts within these cells offers new insight into their biochemistry and functional potential. </plain></SENT>
