</text></title><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the United States, there were 226,870 new cases diagnosed and 39,510 deaths in 2012 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite improvements in survival, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of female cancer mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is well-established that breast cancer genomes harbor complex mutational landscapes, often characterized by point mutations, small insertions and deletions (Indels), and large structure changes across the genome [2–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Such somatic DNA changes in the tumor genome may result in an inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation or deregulation of oncogenes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive identification of these somatic changes is necessary to better understand biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, which may help to predict prognosis and to advance the development of targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To date, large scale genome-wide sequencing projects in breast tumors have identified several key breast cancer related genes, such as TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, GATA3, CDH1, RB1, MAP3K1, and CDKN1B [3,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These studies, however, were conducted in breast cancer patients predominantly of European ancestry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Given the difference in breast cancer subtypes, clinical characteristics, incidence, and survival as well as risk profiles among women of different ethnic backgrounds, somatic aberrations may differ across ethnic groups [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, compared with lung cancer patients of European ancestry, Asian patients carry more EGFR mutations and exhibit higher clinical response rates to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Similarly, somatic EGFR activating mutations in breast cancer were specifically observed in Asian ancestry patients but not in European ancestry patients [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To identify novel somatic alternations of breast cancer, we performed whole-exome sequencing in the breast tumor and matched normal DNA samples from eleven Chinese patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Novel mutations were further selected for replication in additional samples. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The R1122Q mutation occurs at the topological domain of TRPM6 towards the cytoplasm, according to the Uniprot database annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Thereby, dysfunction of the TRPM6 protein may affect the cation homeostasis leading to the tumor development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Recently, Stephens et al. reported two somatic mutations (p.T1822A and p.A1765T) in the TRPM6 gene from screening 100 breast cancer patients of European ancestry [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, the mutation R1122Q that was observed in the present study was not reported in the study of Stephens et al. [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, another study, which included 108 breast cancer patients from Mexico and Vietnam using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, did not discover any mutations in the TRPM6 gene [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Mutations in other members of the TRPM gene family were also reported in breast cancer tumor genome, including three mutations in each of the TRPM8, TRPM3, and TRPM1 genes [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in the TRPM6 gene were also discovered in patients of non-tumor diseases, such as hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In addition to the observed recurrent missense mutation (T3867A) in the HYDIN gene in the present study, ten other mutations have been reported in previous studies [6,21], though each was observed only once in 100 breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The mutation site (T3867A) observed in the present study shows evolutionarily high conservation across all vertebrates with 4.26 of Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) score, implying potentially functional constraint of this mutation site in the HYDIN gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>However, there is less direct evidence linking the biological role of the HYDIN gene to breast carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>It will be of interest to determine the mechanistic and phenotypic consequences of HYDIN mutations in the breast and other tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>We also detected a recurrent mutation (I493V) in the ENTHD1 gene of four patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>However, in the previously two exome sequencing studies of breast cancer, no ENTHD1 mutations were observed [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The functional feature of this gene is largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that the ENTHD1 protein might interact with HDAC6 [23], suggesting that the ENTHD1 may be associated with the histone acetyltransferase activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we also found recurrent novel missense mutations in the CBFB, ADRA1B, KHDRBS1, NDUFB10, RBM25, and KIAA2022 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Among them, the CBFB oncogene has been documented into the COSMIC cancer Gene Census, a gene category for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The CBFB gene plays a critical role in tumor cell growth and proliferation [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Other mutations in this gene were recently reported in breast cancer patients, including nonsense mutations at E152 and R83 and truncating frame shift mutations at E16, Q67 and Y96 [6, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The CBFB mutations were found to be accompanied by deletions of the gene encoding its binding partner, RUNX1, in some breast cancers [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For the ADRA1B gene, which encodes adrenoceptor alpha 1B, a previous study showed this gene is highly expressed in breast tumors with increased tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcome [26], suggesting this gene may perform a cancer-promoting role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The KHDRBS1 gene encodes KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The protein appears to have many functions and may be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including alternative splicing, cell cycle regulation, RNA 3'-end formation, and tumorigenesis [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The NDUFB10 gene encodes NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 10, an integral factor in Complex 1 on the mitochondrial inner membrane [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of NDUFB10 by Src kinase could participate in the development of the proliferative phenotype of glycolytic cancer cells, such as 143B and DU145 cells by preserving complex I activity [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, no mutations were observed in the previous breast cancer exome sequencing data [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The RBM25 gene encodes the RNA binding motif protein 25, one of the RNA-binding regulators that direct the alternative splicing of apoptotic factors such as Bcl-x [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Three other mutations, R708Q, H6D, and G130A, were observed in one study [21] but not in another study [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A different mutation, R348Q, in the KIAA2022 gene is observed in breast cancer tumor in a previous study [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the discovery of some novel somatic mutations partially indicate the difference of somatic aberrations across ethnic groups of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Further comprehensive comparison in genomic aberrations may help to develop cancer therapeutics strategies for the ethnic-specific groups of patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>There are several limitations in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The small sample size in the discovery stage of the present study limits the power to detect driver mutations and compare the mutation profiles stratified by disease subtype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Biological samples used in the present study were collected a couple of years ago, which may affect somatic mutations discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>However, in the present study, we observed those recurrent somatic mutations such as the H1047R mutation in the PIK3CA gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Another limitation is that only a small portion of mutations were selected for replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are some differences in patient characteristics between the discovery and replication stage, such as age and ER/PR status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Small Indels as well as large structure changes were not investigated in the present study due to the high false positive rate using exome sequencing [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>No data were available for tumor purity, which may affect the mutation discovery and validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Similar to other exome sequencing projects, although the high density of read coverage across target region is obtained from the whole-exome sequencing, with over 60-fold on average, there is a small portion of the coding regions in low or no read coverage due to the capturing design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In summary, we discovered novel somatic mutations in the TRPM6, HYDIN, ENTHD1 and NDUFB10 genes in early onset Chinese breast cancer patients through whole exome sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>These mutations were replicated in independent breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Our findings of these novel mutations may provide new clues regarding the molecular mechanism of breast cancer carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
