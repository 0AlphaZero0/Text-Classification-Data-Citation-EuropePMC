In this study, the long-term efficacy and safety of metformin versus placebo in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance is studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded trial, 62 adolescents with obesity aged 10&#x02013;16 years old with insulin resistance received 2000&#x02009;mg of metformin or placebo daily and physical training twice weekly over 18 months. Primary end points were change in body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary end points were safety and tolerability of metformin. Other end points were body fat percentage and HbA1c.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Forty-two participants completed the 18-month study (66&#x00025; girls, median age 13 (12&#x02013;15) years, BMI 30.0 (28.3 to 35.0) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and HOMA-IR 4.08 (2.40 to 5.88)). Median &#x00394;BMI was &#x0002b;0.2 (&#x02212;2.9 to 1.3) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (metformin) versus &#x0002b;1.2 (&#x02212;0.3 to 2.4) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (placebo) (<italic>P</italic>=0.015). No significant difference was observed for HOMA-IR. No serious adverse events were reported. Median change in fat percentage was &#x02212;3.1 (&#x02212;4.8 to 0.3) versus &#x02212;0.8 (&#x02212;3.2 to 1.6)&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>=0.150), in fat mass &#x02212;0.2 (&#x02212;5.2 to 2.1) versus &#x0002b;2.0 (1.2&#x02013;6.4) kg (<italic>P</italic>=0.007), in fat-free mass &#x0002b;2.0 (&#x02212;0.1 to 4.0) versus &#x0002b;4.5 (1.3 to 11.6) kg (<italic>P</italic>=0.047) and in &#x00394;HbA1c &#x0002b;1.0 (&#x02212;1.0 to 2.3) versus &#x0002b;3.0 (0.0 to 5.0) mmol&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>P</italic>=0.020) (metformin versus placebo).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term treatment with metformin in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance results in stabilization of BMI and improved body composition compared with placebo. Therefore, metformin may be useful as an additional therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Childhood obesity is an important pediatric health issue, with rising prevalence rates in almost all European countries, the United States and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> While it was recently reported that the prevalence of overweight and obesity may be stabilizing, percentages are still high, that is, 37.8&#x00025; and 36.6&#x00025; for 11- to 15-year-old boys and girls, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Obesity increases the risk of insulin resistance (IR). Children with obesity with IR have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> and cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Reduction of body mass index (BMI) is known to reduce the risk of developing these diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> However, IR might be a limiting factor in losing weight in children and adolescents with obesity. In a study by Chiavaroli <italic>et al.</italic> the efficacy of a 1-year weight loss intervention programme in children with and without IR was evaluated. Children without IR achieved a reduction in BMI-s.d. score (BMI-SDS) following a weight loss intervention programme, whereas children with IR did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Therefore, for children with obesity and IR additional (pharmacotherapeutic) therapies to lose weight are often considered.</p><p>Metformin is an antidiabetic drug, which reduces peripheral insulin resistance, increases the peripheral glucose uptake and decreases gluconeogenesis of the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Although metformin is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus from the age of 10 years onwards, there is an increasing number of prescriptions for off-label indications such as obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with percentages reported between 8 and 20&#x00025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup></p><p>The evidence for the efficacy of metformin in the treatment of obesity and IR in children is however scarce. A systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials with a trial duration of 6 months (<italic>n</italic>=320) showed a moderate reduction in BMI (&#x02212;1.42&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (95&#x00025; confidence interval 0.83&#x02013;2.02)) and in IR measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; &#x02212;2.01 (95&#x00025; confidence interval 0.75&#x02013;3.26)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Long-term data on the efficacy of metformin is limited to one trial, which studied the efficacy of metformin over 48 weeks, and reported a small reduction in BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> No other studies with treatment duration more than 6 months were identified.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adolescents with obesity with IR is to study the effect of metformin versus placebo on the change in BMI and in IR (measured by HOMA-IR) after 18 months. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, as well as change in body fat percentage, HbA1c, quality of life and physical fitness after 18 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A brief description of the methods is provided here, as the study protocol has been published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>In this 18-month multicentre randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01487993), participants were recruited at the pediatric outpatient clinics of the participating study centres (St Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein/Utrecht (July 2011&#x02013;March 2014) and Jeroen Bosch Hospital, &#x02018;s Hertogenbosch (November 2012&#x02013;March 2014), The Netherlands). For inclusion and exclusion criteria see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. All clinical measurements were performed in the pediatric outpatient clinics or day-care wards of these hospitals; the fitness tests were performed at the physical therapy outpatient clinic of the St Antonius Hospital and at the Sports Medical Centre of the Jeroen Bosch Hospital. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein/Utrecht, the Netherlands, and written informed consent was obtained from the parents and if applicable, from the children (aged &#x02a7e;12 years). From the younger children, oral consent was obtained. All procedures were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) of the Netherlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Consecutive study numbers for eligible participants corresponding with the randomization code and medication number (for example, study number 1, corresponds with randomization number 1 and medication number 1) were allocated. The randomization schedule (in blocks of 20 per study centre) was generated by the department of Clinical Pharmacy of the St Antonius Hospital, using PASW Statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Both subjects and study staff were blinded during the 18-month treatment period. The randomization code was kept secured in the department of Clinical Pharmacy. The blind was not broken for any of the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>For &#x00394;BMI, a group sample size of 47 per group was calculated to have 90&#x00025; power with a significance level of 5&#x00025; to detect a difference of 2.94&#x00025; in BMI (&#x00394;BMI &#x000b1;1&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). For &#x00394;HOMA-IR, a group sample size of 60 participants per group was found to detect a difference of 1.6 in HOMA-IR, with a significance level of 5 and 90&#x00025; power.

Subjects were advised to take the medication during or after breakfast and dinner. In case of gastro-intestinal complaints, the dosage was reduced to the last well-tolerated dose. After symptoms had disappeared, the dosage was again increased to the maximum of two tablets twice daily, if tolerated. To estimate medication compliance, pill counts were performed on returned medication packages during each hospital visit (every 3 months).</p></sec><sec><title>Physical training</title><p>Physical training by a physical therapist was offered twice weekly to all participants.

Comparing our results with these previous short-term results, it seems that our results after 12 months closely resemble them (that is median &#x00394;BMI &#x02212;1.0 (&#x02212;3.4 to 0.6) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for metformin versus &#x0002b;0.6 (&#x02212;0.2 to 2.1) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for placebo, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)). In our study, where we report on treatment effects after 18 months, the difference between metformin and placebo remained significant even though it seems that BMI values return to baseline in the metformin group. However, in the placebo group there was no evidence of a decrease in BMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). An intriguing question is therefore how BMI will change over time after these 18 months. Lavine <italic>et al.</italic> treated children with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for 96 weeks with metformin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> However, the treatment in this study was not primarily focused on weight loss, and participants did not receive lifestyle intervention. They reported changes in BMI after 96 weeks of &#x0002b;1.3 (0.6&#x02013;2.0) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for metformin versus &#x0002b;1.9 (1.1&#x02013;2.7) kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.25).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> This finding illustrates that metformin without lifestyle intervention may not be effective in changing BMI. As a consequence, follow-up results of our study (open-label results) upon 36 months' treatment with metformin with lifestyle intervention will need to be awaited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Until then, in our opinion, lifestyle intervention remains an important part of obesity treatment to which metformin therapy over 18 months seems to be of added value to reduce BMI.</p><p>In our study, two participants discontinued treatment and four participants received a reduced dosage because of adverse events, even though there were no serious adverse events or derangements in hepatic and renal function tests. These findings are comparable to the study of Wilson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> of 48 weeks, where one patient dropped out because of nausea. In studies where metformin was administered over 2&#x02013;6 months, no severe adverse events, elevated hepatic or renal function tests, or decreased vitamin B12 were reported. Concerning vitamin B12, in our study, three participants in the metformin group had decreased vitamin B12 levels and therefore monitoring of vitamin B12 levels upon long-term use of metformin should be considered. In all studies nausea and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Even though these side effects of metformin are mostly mild and self-limiting, a small number of participants (6&#x00025;) did not tolerate metformin because of these side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> It is known that the incidence of gastro-intestinal side effects is higher in patients using immediate-release metformin compared with extended-release metformin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Therefore, the use of extended-release metformin could be considered in the small number of patients with serious gastro-intestinal side effects. From this study, it seems that safety and tolerability of long-term metformin treatment is comparable to short-term treatment (6 months to 48 weeks), with no serious adverse events and only a small percentage of participants who do not tolerate metformin.</p><p>In the current study, participants treated with metformin were found to have an improved body composition measured by bio-impedance analysis after 18 months, with a decrease in fat mass and increase in fat-free mass compared with placebo. In the placebo group, the change in fat-free mass was larger than the change in fat mass. The placebo group has a larger increase in height (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) during the 18 months; the increase in fat-free mass might be related to this increase in height. We assume that this increase in height, and therewith in fat-free mass, is caused by a difference in pubertal stage during the study. At <italic>t</italic>=18months, in the metformin group 38.1&#x00025; was pubertal (Tanner stage 2&#x02013;4) and 57.1&#x00025; postpubertal (Tanner stage 5), compared with 64.7&#x00025; pubertal and 35.3&#x00025; postpubertal in the placebo group. In the metformin group an increase in fat-free mass in accordance with their increase in height over 18 months was found, without an increase in fat mass, resulting in a stable BMI. Also in other studies, a favourable effect of metformin on body composition (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or bio-impedance analysis) after 2&#x02013;11 months of treatment, compared with placebo was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> In adults, a decrease in body fat percentage was related to a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Therefore, a change in body composition during metformin treatment might have a positive influence on cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the number of included participants. For the primary end point (&#x00394;BMI), 66&#x00025; of the targeted number of participants was included, while for the change in HOMA-IR this percentage was only 43&#x00025;, despite a prolongation of the inclusion period by 1.5 years. Furthermore, the dropout rate was 32&#x00025;, whereas a dropout rate of 20&#x00025; was anticipated. This high dropout rate illustrates the difficulties in motivating adolescents with obesity for long-term treatment and follow-up. This difficulty is underlined by the poor attendance at physical fitness tests and by the dietary diaries, which had limited completeness and reliability. Frequent phone calls and written reminders by the study staff did not improve the compliance. The low number of included participants and high dropout rate could have resulted in insufficient power to statistically test our hypotheses. However, although our study has less power than anticipated, we were able to detect a significant effect of metformin on the primary outcome measure (&#x00394;BMI). For comparison, with respect to the IR outcome, other studies with sufficient power did not find an effect on IR after 6 months and 48 weeks either.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Another limitation is the measurement of IR. All participants had HOMA-IR &#x02a7e;3.4 during the screening for eligibility. At baseline, which was planned within a few weeks from screening, some participants had HOMA-IR values &#x0003c;3.4, while still being obese (BMI-SDS &#x0003e;2.3). As a possible explanation for this finding, participants may not tell the truth about their fasting state during the screening. Another reason may be the large coefficient of variation that has been reported for fasting insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> As HOMA-IR is based on fasting insulin, HOMA-IR will vary as well resulting in HOMA-IR&#x0003c;3.4, thereby explaining the lack of difference in this parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, long-term treatment with metformin in adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance results in a stabilization of BMI and improved body composition compared with placebo. Therefore, metformin may be considered a safe additional therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge ZonMw for funding our study and all members of the project group responsible for submitting the project idea to the ZonMw Program for Priority Medicines for Children.
