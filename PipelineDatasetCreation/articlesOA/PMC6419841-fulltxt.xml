Despite increased knowledge of beneficial lifestyle strategies for weight management, rates of overweight and obesity continue to climb among adults in Canada and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The Group Lifestyle Balance&#x02122; (GLB&#x02122;) program is one of the most successful lifestyle-based weight management programs and is currently offered in over 80 primary care settings in the United States and is now becoming increasingly prevalent in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The GLB&#x02122; program was originally intended only for individuals with prediabetes and was formerly referred to as The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). In patients with prediabetes, the DPP lifestyle intervention reduced the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes by 58%, while the biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, Metformin, reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 31% when compared to a placebo pill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the documented success of the DPP, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care encouraged program expansion through broader eligibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and as such some clinics are now offering this program for general weight management (regardless of receiving a prediabetes diagnosis), since overweight and obesity are considered risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Although the GLB&#x02122; program has proven to be successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a &#x0201c;one-size fits all&#x0201d; approach to weight management has been critiqued by experts, who argue that this generalized approach yields minimal weight loss outcomes that do not satisfy the wants and needs of clinicians, researchers and patients alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Genetic testing is an innovative tool, which has the potential to facilitate positive lifestyle changes and enhance patient outcomes, though this has been widely debated in the literature in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A systematic review found that actionable lifestyle recommendations (e.g., &#x0201c;reduce your consumption of sodium&#x0201d;) facilitated behaviour change greater than the provision of simple genetic-based disease-risk estimates, and that nutrition was the most promising lifestyle habit that could be motivated by lifestyle genomics testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">A few studies have assessed change in weight from the provision of genetic-based information compared to a standard intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

Nutrigenomics is a science that explores the interaction between nutrition, genetics, and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The science exploring how nutrition and physical activity, alongside other lifestyle components, can impact health outcomes can be referred to as <italic>lifestyle genomics</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the genes FTO, MC4R, TCF7L2, UCP1, APOA2, and PPARg2 can impact physical activity and dietary approaches to weight management and/or nutritional habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, SNPs located within the genes ACTN3, NFIA-AS2, ADRB3, NRF2 and GSTP1 have been shown to impact genetic predisposition to excel in either endurance or strength-based activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

We aimed to recruit 88 participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44 per group) to account for the potential dropout rate of 20%. While minimal research exists outlining a clinically meaningful change in body fat percentage, a 5% change in weight (which would come from fat mass, water weight and/or muscle mass) is often reported to be clinically meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical experience from the registered dietitians involved in this study helped to determine the clinically meaningful 4% difference mentioned above. This difference has also been supported in published reference standards of body fat percentage in Caucasian adults which indicate that a 4% change in body fat percentage is associated with a 1 &#x02013; 2 decile change on the reference standards charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Cohort randomization</title><p id="Par26">A cohort randomization model was used rather than subject randomization to allow all participants in a given GLB&#x02122; group to obtain the same intervention.

The results for weight, body fat percentage, body fat (kg), lean weight, and water weight from the BIA were communicated to participants during their in-person baseline data collection visit.</p><p id="Par34">To assess possible short-term changes in components of the TPB (e.g. attitudes towards nutrition, physical activity, genetic testing, etc.), the TPB questionnaire was administered twice during the baseline assessment period: once during the one-on-one, in-person meeting (pre-intervention), and once immediately after the first group-based intervention session was delivered (post-intervention).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Blinding and allocation concealment</title><p id="Par35">During informed consent meetings, baseline data collection and the run-in period, participants were blinded to their group assignment. However, participants were not blinded to their group assignment during the administration of the second baseline TPB survey (completed immediately after the first group session in order to assess possible changes short-term in key components of the TPB upon receiving either population-based advice or genetic-based advice). Research assistants collecting and analyzing food intake data were also blinded to the study group of the participants and the statistician will be blinded to the group assignments. Since our outcomes included changes in attitudes related to genetic testing for personalized lifestyle advice, as well as change in nutrition and physical activity habits, it was inappropriate to blind the participants throughout the entire duration of the study. Therefore, participants were informed of their group assignment during the first group intervention meeting, as further outlined in section 4.9, below. One author generated the allocation sequence, enrolled participants, facilitated group and one-on-one interventions, collected data, entered data into the database and scheduled participants, and therefore could not be blinded. Allocation was concealed for the other five co-authors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Staggered cohorts</title><p id="Par36">Staggered cohorts have been used to reduce the impact of confounding by indication and have previously been successful in studies comparing active and passive treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the present study, staggered cohorts were pre-planned in order to maximize study efficiency and effectiveness. Seasonality and timing of groups were considered in the planning phase to ensure that there was a similar amount of SLI groups and PLI groups offered during the day and evening. Three SLI groups were offered during the day, and 2 SLI groups were offered in the evenings. Likewise, 3 PLI groups were offered during the day, and 2 PLI groups were offered in the evenings. 1 SLI group began in the spring, 2 in the summer, and 2 in the fall.

As previously detailed, groups were pre-randomized 1:1 to receive either the standard 12-month GLB&#x02122; Program curriculum + a summary report of population-based lifestyle recommendations (SLI/Control Group), or a modified 12-month GLB&#x02122; Program + a summary report of DNA-based lifestyle recommendations (PLI Group). All participants underwent a group-based weight management program in addition to four one-on-one sessions (one baseline and three follow-up) with a RD. Group sizes ranged from 7 to 20 participants per group at baseline, with a mean group size of 14 participants. At the three follow-up one-on-one sessions, the RD reviewed the information provided in the summary report (population-based recommendations for the SLI group and DNA-based recommendations for the PLI group; refer to Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, respectively, for sample reports). One-on-one sessions lasted approximately 30&#x02009;min. The same RD who completed the one-on-one sessions was also the lead trained lifestyle coach for the GLB&#x02122; Program group sessions. This allowed for optimization of intervention reliability in all group and one-on-one sessions. These sessions were highly standardized as outlined in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. No additional healthcare professionals above and beyond standard practice were hired to run the intervention at the EEFHT. Interventions took place between May 2017 and September 2019.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>SLI group meetings (control group)</title><p id="Par39">The standard GLB&#x02122; Program curriculum involves group-based education on a sustainable healthy lifestyle and a moderately-low-fat, calorie-controlled nutrition plan as further detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Standard GLB&#x02122; group sessions were 1&#x02009;h long. The EEFHT expanded the eligibility criteria for this program and offered it to adults with a BMI &#x02265;25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In addition to the standard GLB&#x02122; Program, participants were provided with an extra 1.5&#x02009;h group session (the first session), where they were given an overview of population-based information and recommendations for calories, protein, total fat, saturated fat, total unsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, meal/snack timing, and physical activity.

The modifications allowed participants in this group to follow their DNA-based recommendations, rather than the standard population-based guidelines. For example, if an individual possessed a genetic variant in the FTO gene whereby a moderately high protein diet can enhance weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], they were given a target for protein, and were taught how to count daily grams of protein (in addition to calories). In comparison, for the standard GLB&#x02122; program, every participant was provided with a target for total fat intake and were taught how to count daily fat grams (in addition to calories). Modified GLB&#x02122; group sessions were 1&#x02009;h long. In addition to the modified GLB&#x02122; Program, participants were provided with an extra 1.5&#x02009;h group session (the first session), where they were given an overview of personalized DNA-based information and recommendations for calories, protein, total fat, saturated fat, total unsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, meal/snack timing, and physical activity. This information is further detailed in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.

All participants were invited to complete follow-up data collection, regardless of their compliance to their intervention&#x02019;s lifestyle recommendation. Complete follow-up data included: BMI, 3-day food records, the CDHQII past-month online food frequency questionnaire, BIA, a past-week physical activity recall, a follow-up demographic survey and medication list, and a TPB questionnaire. Further details of these measures are indicated above in section 4.6. The TPB questionnaire was administered once at each follow-up time point during the one-on-one in-person sessions. In addition, at the 12-month follow-up, participants were asked one open-ended question: <italic>How has your life changed since you started participating in this program/study (if at all)?</italic> Follow-up data collection commenced in August 2017 and is ongoing until September 2019.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p id="Par42">We plan to use SPSS Version 23.0 to conduct all statistical analyses, and the data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Generalized linear mixed-effects models will be used to test between group differences from baseline to each follow-up period for each outcome indicator. If significant mean differences are detected, a Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test will be used to compare differences by group. General linear regression models will be used to assess interactions between a given genotype of interest and dietary component of interest on BMI and body composition.

Furthermore, it aims to test the aforementioned hypotheses, based on lifestyle genomics weight management advice available to consumers globally through commercial genetic testing. This highlights the pragmatic nature of this trial, and optimizes the potential for knowledge translation on a global-scale.</p><p id="Par46">The NOW Trial protocol differs from previous research in that it was designed pragmatically, using a knowledge translation approach. Furthermore, the NOW Trial aims to compare a DNA-based lifestyle change program to the gold standard, population-based lifestyle change program (the GLB&#x02122; Program), while considering and accounting for major confounding factors of behaviour change. It is also the first lifestyle genomics weight management and behaviour change study to incorporate the TPB into the study design; this may help target a sub-set of the population that may benefit most from genetic testing for weight management. This trial is also unique because the genetic information was presented to participants in a group setting, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this more efficient approach to the delivery of genetic information.</p><p id="Par47">Pragmatic clinical trials are distinguished by their focus on informing clinical practice rather than confirming a physiological or clinical hypothesis. Notably, pragmatic trials help to inform real-world research questions that are applicable to broad patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Given the novel and pragmatic nature of the study, the NOW Trial provides several original contributions to the literature. Overall, the NOW Trial will provide important, innovative health knowledge relevant to researchers, academia, consumers, the genetic testing industry, clinicians and public health authorities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
