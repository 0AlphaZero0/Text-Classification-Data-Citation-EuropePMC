Modeled after the GNU (GNU's Not Unix) Textutils such as <monospace>grep</monospace>, <monospace>cut</monospace>, and <monospace>tr</monospace>, FAST tools such as <monospace>fasgrep</monospace>, <monospace>fascut</monospace>, and <monospace>fastr</monospace> make it easy to rapidly prototype expressive bioinformatic workflows in a compact and generic command vocabulary. Compact combinatorial encoding of data workflows with FAST commands can simplify the documentation and reproducibility of bioinformatic protocols, supporting better transparency in biological data science. Interface self-consistency and conformity with conventions of GNU, Matlab, Perl, BioPerl, R, and GenBank help make FAST easy and rewarding to learn. FAST automates numerical, taxonomic, and text-based sorting, selection and transformation of sequence records and alignment sites based on content, index ranges, descriptive tags, annotated features, and in-line calculated analytics, including composition and codon usage. Automated content- and feature-based extraction of sites and support for molecular population genetic statistics make FAST useful for molecular evolutionary analysis. FAST is portable, easy to install and secure thanks to the relative maturity of its Perl and BioPerl foundations, with stable releases posted to CPAN. Development as well as a publicly accessible Cookbook and Wiki are available on the FAST GitHub repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tlawrence3/FAST">https://github.com/tlawrence3/FAST</ext-link>. The default data exchange format in FAST is Multi-FastA (specifically, a restriction of BioPerl FastA format). Sanger and Illumina 1.8+ FastQ formatted files are also supported. FAST makes it easier for non-programmer biologists to interactively investigate and control biological data at the speed of thought.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Unix philosophy</kwd><kwd>MultiFASTA</kwd><kwd>pipeline</kwd><kwd>bioinformatic workflow</kwd><kwd>open source</kwd><kwd>BioPerl</kwd><kwd>regular expression</kwd><kwd>NCBI taxonomy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7315"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Bioinformatic software for non-programmers is traditionally implemented for user convenience in monolithic applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) (Smith et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Stothard, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Rampp et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Librado and Rozas, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Waterhouse et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gouy et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, the monolithic application paradigm is easily outscaled by today's big biological data, particularly Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data at gigabyte- and terabyte-scales. Better empowerment of non-programmers for genome-scale analytics of big biological data has been achieved through web-based genome browser interfaces (Markowitz et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Cunningham et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Rosenbloom et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). On the other hand, for smaller datasets, sequence and alignment editor applications encourage manual manipulation of data, which is error-prone and essentially irreproducible. To reduce error and increase reproducibility in the publishing of bioinformatic and biostatistical protocols it is important to facilitate the documentation and automation of data science workflows through scripts and literate programming facilities (Knuth, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) such as emacs org-mode (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</ext-link>), as demonstrated in, for example (Delescluse et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) that both completely document and encode scientific workflows for machine processing of biological data.</p><p>Reproducibility in bioinformatics and biostatistics protocols is crucial to maintaining public trust in the value of its investments in high-throughput and high-dimensional measurements of complex biological systems (Baggerly and Coombes, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hutson, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Baggerly and Coombes, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Huang and Gottardo, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In one analysis, only two of 18 published microarray gene-expression analyses were completely reproducible, in part because key analysis steps were made with proprietary closed-source software (Ioannidis et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Furthermore, even though analytical errors are a major source of retractions in the scientific literature (Casadevall et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), peer-review and publication of scientific data processing protocols is generally not yet required to publish scientific studies. Adequate documentation of bioinformatic and biostatistical workflows and open source sharing of code upon publication (Peng, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) facilitates crowd-sourced verification, correction and extension of code-based analyses (Barnes, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Morin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and reuse of software and data to enable more scientific discovery returns from public data (Peng, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Peer review and publication of the data science protocols associated to scientific studies stems temptation to overinterpret results and encourages more objectivity in data science (Boulesteix, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The ultimate remedy for these problems is to expand literacy in modern computational and statistical data science for science students in general (Morin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Joppa et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Web-based open-source workflow suites such as Galaxy (Blankenberg and Hillman-Jackson, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), Taverna (Oinn et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and BioExtract (Lushbough et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) are a recent innovation in the direction of greater reproducibility in bioinformatics protocols for genome-scale analytics. However, the most powerful, transparent and customizable medium for reproducible bioinformatics work is only available to bioinformatics specialists and programmers through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) such as BioPerl and Ensembl (Yates et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Yet workflow design suites and programming APIs require dedication and time to learn. There is a need for more bioinformatics software in between GUIs and APIs, that empowers non-programmer scientists and researchers to interactively and reproducibly control, process and analyze their data without manual interventions. Closer inspection of data and interactive construction and control of data workflows makes it so much easier to rapidly prototype error-free workflows, nipping errors in the bud that can completely confound downstream analyses. In scientific computing, the time-tested paradigm for rapid prototyping of reproducible data workflows is the Unix command-line.</p><p>In this tradition we here present FAST: FAST Analysis Sequences Toolbox, modeled after the standard Unix toolkit (Peek, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), now called Coreutils. The FAST tools follow the Unix philosophy to &#x0201c;do one thing and do it well&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;write programs to work together.&#x0201d; (Stutz, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). FAST workflows are completely automated; no manual interventions to data are required. FAST falls between a GUI and an API, because it is used through a Command-Line Interface (CLI). Although the FAST tools are written in Perl using BioPerl packages (Stajich et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), FAST users do not need to be able to program Perl or know BioPerl. FAST users only need basic competence in Unix and the modest skill to compose command pipelines in the Unix shell. FAST therefore supports an emerging movement to empower non-programmer biologists to learn Unix for scientific computing. Books and courses in this emerging market include the recent &#x0201c;UNIX and Perl to the Rescue!&#x0201d; (Bradnam and Korf, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Foundations workshops (Wilson, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Unix command pipe-lines are the paradigmatic example of the &#x0201c;pipes and filters&#x0201d; design pattern that embodies serial processing of data through sequences of modular and reuseable computations. The &#x0201c;pipes and filters&#x0201d; design pattern is a special case of component-based software engineering (McIlroy, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>) and a core paradigm in software architecture (Garlan and Shaw, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). The component-wise organization of FAST affords access to an infinite variety of customizable queries and workflows on biological sequence data using a small command vocabulary and combinatorial logic. Component-based software is easier to learn, maintain and extend. It also makes it easy for users to interactively develop new protocols through the modular extension and recombination of existing protocols. As shown from the examples below, non-trivial computations may be expressed on a single line of the printed page. Thus, FAST can help empower non-biologist programmers to develop and communicate powerful and reproducible bioinformatic workflows for scientific investigations and publishing.</p><p>Open-source command-line utilities for bioinformatics such as the EMBOSS package (Rice et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), the FASTX tools (Gordon, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) or the scripts that come with BioPerl (Stajich et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) typically offer suites of tools with simple, well-defined functions that lend themselves to scripting, but are not necessarily designed according to the Unix toolbox philosophy specifically to interoperate through serial composition over pipes. Similarly, FaBox (Villesen, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) is a free and open online server with functions that overlap with FAST tools, but is not designed for serial composition. On the other hand, the Unix toolbox model has been used before in more or less more specialized bioinformatics applications such as the popular SAMTools suite (Li et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and in the processing of NMR data (Delaglio et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). A toolsuite called bp-utils, with a similar design philosophy and some overlapping functionality with FAST, has recently been released at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diverge.hunter.cuny.edu/labwiki/Bioutils">http://diverge.hunter.cuny.edu/labwiki/Bioutils</ext-link>.</p><p>We have written extensive documentation for each FAST utility along with useful error messages following recommended practice (Seemann, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). FAST is free and open source; its code is freely available to anyone to re-use, verify and extend through its GitHub repository.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Design and implementation of FAST tools</title><sec><title>2.1. The FAST data model</title><p>The Unix Coreutils paradigm allows users to treat plain-text files and data streams as databases in which <italic>records</italic> correspond to single lines containing <italic>fields</italic> separated by <italic>delimiters</italic> such as commas, tabs, or strings of white-space characters. FAST extends this paradigm to biological sequence data, allowing users to treat collections of files and streams of multi-line sequence records as databases for complex queries, transformations and analytics. FAST generalizes the GNU Coreutils model exactly because it models sequence record <italic>descriptions</italic> as an ordered collection of <italic>description fields</italic> (see below).</p><p>Another design feature of Unix tools that also characterizes the FAST tools is their ability to accept input not only from one or more files but also from what is called <italic>standard input</italic>, a data-stream supported by the Unix shell, and to output analogously to <italic>standard output</italic>. It is this facility that allows FAST tools to be serially composed in Unix <italic>pipelines</italic> that compactly represent an infinite variety of expressive bioinformatic workflows.</p><p>The default data exchange format for FAST tools is the universally recognized FastA format (Lipman and Pearson, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). While no universal standard exists for this format, for FAST, &#x0201c;FastA format&#x0201d; means what is conventionally called &#x0201c;multi-fasta&#x0201d; format of sequence or alignment data, largely as implementated in BioPerl in the module <monospace>Bio::SeqIO::fasta</monospace> (Stajich et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>In the FAST implementation of FastA format, multiple sequence records may appear in a single file or input stream. Sequence data may contain gap characters. The logical elements (or fields) of a sequence record are its <italic>identifier</italic>, its <italic>description</italic> and its <italic>sequence</italic>. The identifier (indicated with <monospace>id</monospace> in the illustration below) and description (<monospace>desc</monospace>) together make the <italic>identifier line</italic> of a sequence record, which must begin with the sequence record start symbol <monospace>&#x0003e;</monospace> on a single line. The description begins after the first block of white-space on this line (indicated with <monospace>&#x0003c;space&#x0003e;</monospace>). The <italic>sequence</italic> of a record appears immediately after its identifier line and may continue over multiple lines until the next record starts.</p><p>In FAST, users may alter how description fields are defined in sequence records by using Perl-style <italic>regular expressions</italic> to define delimiters (indicated by <monospace>&#x0003c;delim&#x0003e;</monospace>). FAST uses one-based indexing of description fields.</p><p>The FAST data model is illustrated as follows:</p><preformat>&#x0003e;seq1-id&#x0003c;space&#x0003e;seq1-desc-field1
&#x000a0;&#x0003c;delim&#x0003e;seq1-desc-field2&#x0003c;delim&#x0003e;...

seq2-sequence
seq2-sequence
...
seq2-sequence</preformat><p>In FAST, the sequence identifier is thought of as the 0th field of the identifier line. One-based indexing of description fields in FAST is therefore consistent with zero-based indexing in Perl and one-based indexing of sequence coordinates, making all indexing consistent and uniform in FAST.</p><p>Most FAST tools extend the field-based paradigm further by supporting <italic>tagged values</italic> in sequence record descriptions. Tagged values are name-value pairs with a format &#x0201c;name=value" as common in General Feature Format (GFF) used in sequence annotation (see e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/">https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/</ext-link>) or an alternative &#x0201c;name:value&#x0201d; format that certain FAST tools themselves can annotate in-line into sequence records by appending a new field to sequence record descriptions. Support for tagged values in FAST makes it possible to operate on sequence records with unordered or heterogeneous description fields.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Overview of the FAST tools</title><p>FAST utilities may be assigned to categories according to their default behavior and intended use.

General implementation and benchmarking</title><p>The BioPerl backend of FAST 1.x is version 1.6.901 downloaded in January, 2012. <monospace>Bio::SeqIO</monospace> components were updated to version 1.6.923 on June 4, 2014 and some Bio::Root components were updated on July 10, 2014 (github commit 50f87e9a4d). We introduced a small number of customizations to the BioPerl code-base, primarily to enable the translation of sequences containing gaps. All of the BioPerl dependencies of FAST are isolated under its own FAST name-space.</p><p>To help reduce the overall installation footprint of FAST, BioPerl dependencies of FAST scripts were analyzed with the Cava packager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cavapackager.com">http://www.cavapackager.com</ext-link>).</p><p>Nearly all FAST utilities process sequence records inline and therefore have linear runtime complexity in the number of sequences. Exceptions are <monospace>fassort</monospace> and <monospace>fastail</monospace> which both require some paging of data into temporary files. We performed benchmarking of FAST tools using randomly generated sequences of even composition sourced generated in Python and the <monospace>Benchmark</monospace> v1.15 Perl module on a MacBook Pro 2.5 Ghz Intel i7, with 8 Gb of RAM. We examined average CPU runtime over 100 replicates, comparing input sizes of 25K, 250K, or 1M sequence records of length 100, 10K, 100K, or 1M bp. Our benchmarking results show that despite data paging, <monospace>fassort</monospace> runtimes scale linearly with input size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Average processor time of 100 repetitions required to complete analysis using indicated utility</bold>.

Installation and dependencies</title><p>FAST requires a working Perl installation, with official releases distributed through the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). A small footprint of BioPerl dependencies has been packaged together in the FAST namespace. Other CPAN dependencies may be detected and installed by the <monospace>cpan</monospace> package manager. A fully automated install from CPAN may on many systems be initiated by executing <monospace>perl -MCPAN -e 'install FAST'</monospace>. A manual install follows standard Perl install procedure. After downloading and unpacking the source directory, change into that directory and execute: <monospace>perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; (sudo) make install</monospace>.</p><p>We recommend that first-time users first complete the automated install from CPAN which will handle prerequisites, and then download and open the source code directory in order to practice the example usage commands (such as those in the sequel) on sample data provided within.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5. Implementation and usage of individual tools</title><p>Further implementation and usage details of individual FAST tools follows. Usage examples for individual tools refer to example data that ships with the FAST source-code installer, available from CPAN. The most recent version at the time of publication is 1.06, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://search.cpan.org/~dhard/FAST-1.06/">http://search.cpan.org/~dhard/FAST-1.06/</ext-link> and as Supplementary Material. However we recommend to use the most recent version of FAST. For maximum reproducibility, always cite the version number when publishing results with FAST. These usage examples should be able to run from within the installation directory after installation has completed.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><monospace><bold>fasgrep</bold></monospace> supports <italic>regular expression</italic>-based selection of sequence records. FAST uses Perl-style regular expressions, which are documented freely online and within Perl, and are closely related to Unix extended regular expressions. For reference on Perl regular expressions, try executing <monospace>man perlre</monospace> or <monospace>perldoc perlre</monospace>. For example, to print only protein sequences that do <italic>not</italic> start with M for methionine, execute:
<preformat>fasgrep -s -v &#x02033;^M&#x02033; t/data/P450.fas</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>In the above command the <monospace>-s</monospace> option directs <monospace>fasgrep</monospace> to search the sequence data of each record. The <monospace>-v</monospace> option directs <monospace>fasgrep</monospace> to print records that <italic>do not</italic> match the pattern given by its argument, which is the regular expression <monospace>^M</monospace>, in which the <italic>anchor</italic>
<monospace>^</monospace> specifies the beginning of the sequence data. <monospace>fasgrep</monospace> uses the BioPerl <monospace>Bio::Tools::SeqPattern</monospace> library to support ambiguity expansion of IUPAC codes in its regular expression arguments. Thus, to show that a segment of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> chromosome 1 contains at least one instance of an &#x0201c;Autonomous Consensus Sequence&#x0201d; characteristic of yeast origins of replication (Leonard and McHali, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), look whether the following command outputs a sequence or not (note that all commands reproduced here should be entered on a single line at the Unix shell prompt):
<preformat>fasgrep -se 'WTTTAYRTTTW'

Ranges may be specified in Perl-style (or GenBank coordinate style) like <monospace>from..to</monospace>, in R/Octave-style like <monospace>from:to</monospace> or UNIX <monospace>cut</monospace>-style as in <monospace>from-to</monospace>. For example, to print records with gi numbers between 200 and 500 million, try executing:
<preformat>fasfilter -x &#x02033;gi\|(\d+)&#x02033; 2e8..5e8
t/data/P450.fas</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>This example uses the <monospace>-x</monospace> option which directs <monospace>fasfilter</monospace> to filter on the value within the <italic>capture buffer</italic> which occurs within the left-most pair of parentheses of the argument, here (<monospace>\d+</monospace>), and <monospace>\d+</monospace> is a regular expression matching a string of one or more digits from 0 to 9. The backslash after <monospace>gi</monospace> in the first argument quotes the vertical bar character to make it literal, since the vertical bar character is a special character in regular expressions.</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>fascut</bold></monospace> supports index-based selections of characters and fields in sequence records allowing repetition, reordering, variable steps, and reversals. Ranges are specified otherwise similarly to <monospace>fasfilter</monospace>. Negative indices count backwards from last characters and fields. <monospace>fascut</monospace> outputs the concatenation of data selections for each sequence record. Variable step-sizes in index ranges conveniently specify first, second or third codon positions in codon sequence records, for example. Examples using this syntax appear in the sequel. To print the last ten residues of each sequence, execute:
<preformat>fascut -10..-1 t/data/P450.fas</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>alncut</bold></monospace> implements content-based selection of sites in alignments including gap-free sites, non-allgap sites, variable or invariant sites and parsimoniously informative sites, or their set-complements, all with the option of state-frequency-thresholds applied per site. By default, <monospace>alncut</monospace> prints only invariant sites. To print the set-complement, or only variable sites, use the <monospace>-v</monospace> option:
<preformat>alncut -v t/data/popset_32329588.fas</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>To print sites in which no more than two sequences contain gaps, execute:

For example, to output 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; Untranslated Region (UTR) sequences from a GenBank formatted sequence of a gene, we use the <monospace>-k</monospace> option to restrict matching to features whose &#x0201c;keys&#x0201d; match the regular expression &#x0201c;UTR&#x0201d;:
<preformat>gbfcut -k UTR t/data/AF194338.1.gb</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace>gbfcut</monospace> can handle split features such as a coding region (CDS) that is split over several exons:
<preformat>gbfcut -k CDS t/data/AF194338.1.gb</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>More fine-grained queries of features are possible using qualifiers defined with the <monospace>-q</monospace> option. Multiple qualifiers may be provided at once, specifying the selection of records for which all qualifiers apply (conjunction). For example, compare the output of the following two commands:
<preformat>gbfcut -k tRNA t/data/mito-ascaris.gb
gbfcut -k tRNA -q product=Ser
-q note^AGN t/data/mito-ascaris.gb</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>The second command queries for features with key &#x0201c;tRNA&#x0201d; containing at least one qualifier &#x0201c;/product&#x0201d; whose value matches the string literal &#x0201c;Ser&#x0201d; and no qualifiers of type &#x0201c;/note&#x0201d; whose values match the string literal &#x0201c;AGN.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>gbfalncut</bold></monospace> automates the selection of sites from alignments that correspond to one or more features annotated on one of the sequences in a separate GenBank record. This workflow eliminates the need for manual entry of coordinates and implements a useful bioinformatic query in terms of known and reproducible quantities from public data and sequence records, allowing users to query sites based on biological vocabularies of sequence features. For an example of its use see the section &#x0201c;Composing Workflows in FAST&#x0201d; in the sequel.</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>faspaste</bold></monospace> concatenates data from records input in parallel from multiple data-streams or files, record-by-record. The user may paste data from the standard input stream and from multiple input files, in an order defined by the arguments. Records from standard input may be used multiple times in concatenating data. Like in some implementions of the Unix tool <monospace>paste</monospace>, a hyphen input argument <monospace>-</monospace> to <monospace>faspaste</monospace> refers to the standard input stream and may be used more than once as an input argument. For maximum configurability, <monospace>faspaste</monospace> concatenates only one data field type (i.e., sequences or descriptions) at a time. Users may select which data stream will provide templates to receive concatenated data in output records. For example, to paste sequences of corresponding records from two data-files together and output them with the identifiers and descriptions of the data in the first file, execute:
<preformat>faspaste data1.fas data2.fas</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>See the sequel for more advanced usage examples with <monospace>faspaste</monospace>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>fassort</bold></monospace> and <monospace><bold>fasuniq</bold></monospace> are designed to be often used together in Unix pipelines. The <monospace>fassort</monospace> utility implements numerical and textual sorting of sequence records by specific fields. The <monospace>fasuniq</monospace> utility removes (and optionally counts) records that are redundant with respect to a specific field, such as sequences or identifiers. In the implementation of <monospace>fassort</monospace>, pages of data are sorted with optimized routines in Perl <monospace>Sort::Key</monospace> that, if necessary, are written to temporary files and merged with <monospace>Sort::MergeSort</monospace>. Like its Unix Coreutil analog <monospace>uniq</monospace>, <monospace>fasuniq</monospace> compares only immediately successive input records. Therefore, users will usually want to first sort data with <monospace>fassort</monospace> before passing it to <monospace>fasuniq</monospace>. To illustrate, the following example combines and sorts input records from two instances of the same file, and then counts and removes each redundant record:
<preformat>fassort -s t/data/P450.fas
t/data/P450.fas | fasuniq -c</preformat></p></list-item><list-item><p>This example illustrates that the same file may be specified as an input stream more than once to any FAST command.</p></list-item><list-item><p><monospace><bold>fastax</bold></monospace> and <monospace><bold>fastaxsort</bold></monospace> implement taxonomic searching and sorting of sequence records, whose records are already annotated with NCBI taxonomic identifiers using taxonomic data from NCBI taxonomy (Benson et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sayers et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For example, a query of &#x0201c;Metazoa&#x0201d; would match records labeled <italic>&#x0201c;Homo sapiens,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Drosophila melanogaster,&#x0201d;</italic> and &#x0201c;Lepidoptera&#x0201d; but not <italic>&#x0201c;Candida albicans&#x0201d;</italic> or &#x0201c;Alphaproteobacteria.&#x0201d; Taxonomic selections may be logically negated and/or restricted to only those records containing valid NCBI taxonomic identifiers. Purely for historical reasons, the internal implementation of NCBI taxonomic data is custom to FAST rather than the <monospace>Bio::Taxonomy</monospace> libraries in BioPerl. A sample of data from tRNAdb-CE (Abe et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), in which data records are annotated with valid NCBI taxonomic identifiers in specific description fields, is included with the FAST installation package. After downloading datafiles &#x0201c;nodes.dmp&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;names.dmp&#x0201d; from NCBI Taxonomy, the following command filters sequences from Rhizobiales, assuming that records are labeled with their species (and strain) of origin in the third field of the description of the sample data file:
<preformat>fastax -f 3 -S &#x02033; \| &#x02033;

The utility <monospace>fastr</monospace> handles character-based transliterations, deletions and &#x0201c;squashing&#x0201d; (deletion of consecutive repeats), sequence degapping, and restriction or remapping of sequence data to strict or IUPAC ambiguity alphabets.

Selecting sites from alignments by annotated features</title><p>Another example, that reproduces a published result from (Ardell et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), demonstrates the utility of combining <monospace>gbfalncut</monospace> with <monospace>alnpi</monospace>, allowing users to select sites from alignments corresponding to features annotated on one of the sequences in a separate GenBank file. For example, to calculate a Tajima's <italic>D</italic> statistic for 5&#x02032; UTRs, corresponding to the the last line in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> of that work, execute:</p><preformat>gbfalncut -k t/data/AF194338.1.gb 5.UTR

Selecting sequences by encoded motifs</title><p>An advantage of the annotation approach in FAST is the ability to select and sort sequences by attributes computed and annotated into data by utilities upstream in the pipeline. For example, to select protein-coding genes from a file <monospace>cds.fas</monospace> whose translations contain the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation amino acid motif (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>), one could execute:</p><preformat>
fasxl -a cds.fas | fasgrep -t xl0
&#x000a0;&#x02033;N[^P][ST][^P]&#x02033; | fascut -f 1..-2</preformat><p>The first command in the pipeline translates each sequence and appends the translation to the description with the tag &#x0201c;xl0&#x0201d; (indicating translation in the zeroth reading frame). The second command in the pipeline uses a regular expression to represent the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation amino acid motif pattern as the value of a &#x0201c;name:value&#x0201d; pair in the description with tag &#x0201c;xl0,&#x0201d; hence processing the annotations produced by <monospace>fasxl</monospace>. The regex argument to <monospace>fasgrep</monospace> is quoted to protect the argument from interpretation by the shell. The last command in the pipeline removes the last field in the description, restoring records as they were before they were annotated by <monospace>fasxl</monospace>.</p></sec><sec><title>4.3. Sorting records by third codon position composition</title><p>Another example illustrates the powerful expression of ranges in <monospace>fascut</monospace>. An optional &#x0201c;by&#x0201d; parameter in ranges allows increments or decrements in steps larger than one. To extract third-position bases from codon sequence records, compute and annotate their compositions into record descriptions, ultimately sorting records by their third-position adenosine contents, do:</p><preformat>fascut 3:-1:3 cds.fas | fascomp | fassort
&#x000a0;-nt comp_A</preformat></sec><sec><title>4.4. More advanced merging of data records</title><p>More advanced usage of <monospace>faspaste</monospace> requires Unix pipelines. For example to join <bold>both</bold> descriptions and sequences from two data-files, execute:</p><preformat>faspaste data1.fas data2.fas | faspaste
&#x000a0;-d - data2.fas</preformat><p>The hyphen second argument (-) to the second instance of <monospace>faspaste</monospace> refers to the input received from standard input through the pipe. This example works because by default, <monospace>faspaste</monospace> uses (&#x0201c;mutates&#x0201d;) records from the data stream named in its first argument to receive the data concatenated from all records.</p><p>To prepend the first sequence of one file repeatedly to every sequence in another file, execute:</p><preformat>
fashead -n 1 t/data/fasxl_test4.fas |
&#x000a0;faspaste -r - t/data/fasxl_test4.fas</preformat><p>To prepend the first sequence of one file repeatedly to every other sequence in another file, using identifiers and descriptions from the second file in the output, execute:</p><preformat>
fashead -n 1 t/data/fasxl_test3.fas |
&#x000a0;faspaste -r -R 2 - t/data/fasxl_test4.fas</preformat></sec></sec><sec><title>5.
