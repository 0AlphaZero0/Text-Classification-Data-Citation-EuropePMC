</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Inoculation with vaccinia virus (VACV) protected against smallpox, a deadly disease caused by the related orthopoxvirus, variola (VARV) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Its success pertains to its high infectivity and thermal stability, and the strong innate and B-cell immune responses that it triggers [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>With the eradication of circulating variola virus from the human population, large-scale vaccination efforts against smallpox were ended [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>As a result, the general population is no longer protected against orthopoxviruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This lack of immunity is a concern due to the zoonotic risk of orthologous strains [6] such as monkeypox virus (MPXV) and specific strains of the cowpox species (CPXV) [7, 8], as well as their potential use as biological weapon [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is because of the latter that certain professional groups, including military personnel are still getting vaccinated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine used in the eradication campaign was highly effective, but was associated with adverse side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The frequency of side effects was acceptable at the time where smallpox was a major health threat but is unacceptable in the 21st century. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>More recently a vaccinia virus clonal isolate, ACAM2000 has been used, produced using modern cell cultures [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Highly attenuated vaccinia strains such as Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) have been available for decades [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Large MVA clinical trials, and clinical use, have found that MVA has an outstanding safety profile, but this is accompanied by a decreased immunogenicity resulting in the need for two immunizations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since MVA usage was predominantly after smallpox eradication, the protective efficiency of MVA toward variola virus was not proven. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Research on new orthopox vaccines continues, both in response to these concerns and as a means of understanding why the vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine is so effective. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The strategies leading to today's next generation candidate smallpox vaccines are diverse: they include, but are not limited to, the use of (i) vaccinia immunization in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor [14], (ii) DNA immunization using select immunodominant antigens [15–18], and (iii) soluble poxvirus proteins [19–21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A limited number of immunodominant antigens [22] have been linked to successful protection: intracellular mature virion (IMV) antigens A27 [23, 24], D8 [25, 26], F9 [27], H3 [20, 28], L1 [29] and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) antigens A33 [30–32], and B5 [33, 34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Maximal protection is obtained with vaccines combining recombinant membrane proteins from both forms of the infectious virus (IMV and the EEV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The virus encodes the seven proteins A33, A34, A36, A56, B5, F12, and F13, that are specific for the EEV membrane [32, 34–38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Among those, A33 is a 23 kDa, homodimeric type II transmembrane that undergoes both O- and N-glycosylation (N125 and N135) [32, 36, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Both N-linked glycosylation sites are used in vaccinia but variola virus and monkeypox virus lack the equivalent N125 site [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A33 controls the incorporation of A36 into the EEV particle and subsequently the production of actin tails. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Therefore, A33 plays an important role in effective cell-to-cell spread within the host [41–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A33 is also required for proper trafficking of B5 to the EEV-specific membrane and proper formation of infectious EEV [43, 44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>A33 contains a membrane-proximal cysteine on the A33 ectodomain that forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, this cysteine is not required for the production of infectious extracellular virus [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of the ectodomain of A33 revealed an unusual C-type lectin-fold domain, similar in overall architecture to several NK cell ligands [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Antibodies targeting EEV proteins can protect against viral challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>For example, anti-B5 mAbs are protective against lethal orthopoxvirus challenges in multiple small animals models [33, 46, 47] and anti-A33 antibodies can be protective in vivo [15, 30, 48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Protection mediated by anti-B5 antibodies is not mediated by conventional direct virus neutralization, as EEV is highly resistant to direct neutralization by anti-B5 antibodies, anti-A33 antibodies, and other EEV targets [46, 50, 51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, protective anti-B5 mAbs are highly efficient at facilitating complement-mediated neutralization of EEV, complement-mediated lysis of infected cells, and Fc-dependent protective mechanisms [46, 51, 52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of protective action of A33 antibodies are similar to those of B5 [52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Using X-ray crystallography, we mapped the A33 epitopes for three different antibodies and characterized their VACV-neutralization potential in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We further identified one antibody (A27D7) that binds to A33 with high affinity, even when epitope residues are individually changed to other amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We further tested the MAb binding to recombinant A33, where epitope residues were replaced with those from other orthopoxviruses and observed high affinity binding for A27D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In an ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection model, A27D7 MAb was protective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In summary this suggests, that A27D7 is cross-species protective and able to neutralize a range of different orthopoxviruses in vivo. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We generated seven anti-A33 antibodies (A2C7, A26C7, A17D7, A25D11, A27D7, A25F2, and A20G2) by VACV immunization of mice followed by boosting with recombinant A33 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing revealed that the seven MAbs are assembled from five distinct heavy chain (HC) and 4 different light chain (LC) sequences (S1 Table): While A2C7, A17D7, and A25F2 have distinct HC sequences, A26C7 shares the HC with A27D7 and A25D11 shares the HC with A20G2, with only one amino acid exchange in CDR L1 (L to F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The LC sequences of A26C7 and A27D7 are nearly identical, while A25D11 is almost identical to A20G2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Both LC pairs only differ by one amino acid substitution in CDR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A2C7 and A25F2 are derived from the same germline genes and are highly similar, while the A17D7 LC sequence could not be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In summary, antibodies A25D11 and A20G2 are identical except for one amino acid difference and the same is true for antibodies A26C7 and A27D7, resulting in a total of five distinct antibodies, of which we have complete sequences for A2C7, and A26C7/A27D7, A25D11/A20G2, and A25F2. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Peptide ELISA performed with 20mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids and covering nearly the entire amino acid sequence of A33, indicated that all anti-A33 MAbs bind only to recombinant A33 but not to any linear peptide (S1 Fig). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>IgG1 anti-A33 mAbs A17D7 and A25F2 at 10 μg/ml exhibited no complement mediated EEV neutralization, consistent with the inability of recruiting complement by IgG1 MAbs in general (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>However, IgG2a (A26C7, A25D11, A27D7, and A20G2) and IgG2b (A2C7) anti-A33 MAbs at 10 μg/ml exhibited strong complement-mediated EEV neutralization in the presence of complement (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both A2C7 and A20G2, which failed to bind the ECTV A33 mimic failed to protect against ECTV challenge as expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>The strong protection of A27D7 against ECTV challenge at day 1 post infection is surprising but we believe a reflection of its unique binding to A33, in which the antibody-antigen interface can tolerate several amino acid exchanges and still bind with high affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>There is slightly reduced protection when the A27D7 is administered 1 day prior to ECTV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>As A27D7 fully protects against VACV when given at day -1, it could be that the antibody half-life in vivo is more important during the ECTV challenge, especially since the A27D7 binds with reduced affinity to the ECTV A33 mimic compared to VACV A33 and a higher dose of antibody could therefore be needed for full protection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>A former study showed that VACV-A33 vaccination protected mice against ECTV but interestingly not against CPXV-Br [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>The reason for the lack of protection remains unclear, because VACV is more closely related to CPXV-Br than to ECTV (S4 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>To address this conundrum, we have developed an in vitro assay to assess the potential cross-neutralization ability of a given antibody in three steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>First, we used single alanine mutagenesis to engineer variants of A33 in which epitope residues that were predicted to be important for antibody binding based on our structural data were targeted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Next, the real-time binding kinetics of the A33 variants to the different antibodies was tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Antibodies that showed robust binding to different A33 variants (e.g. A27D7) were further assessed in their ability to bind to A33 variants that have been engineered in their epitope to mimic the sequence of other orthopox strains, including ECTV and CPXV/MPXV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>If high affinity binding to these A33 cross-species variants is still observed, we predict that the antibodies would be protective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Using such in vitro approach, rather than expressing all of the orthologous A33 antigens individually, is highly time and cost efficient and sufficient to predict the outcome of specific MAb-guided protection experiments, and does not require any stringent safety procedure associated to virulent strains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>In our experiments the antibody A2C7, which failed to bind to the A33 Gln173Arg ECTV mimic, also failed to protect against lethal challenge with ECTV, as expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Position 173 is occupied by arginine in ECTV, while glutamine is conserved in all other strains (S4 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Position 173 is also common to all three epitopes and we expected Gln173Arg mutation to decrease binding of all three MAbs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>It indeed resulted in abrogating A33 binding to A2C7 and A20G2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>However, its effect was opposite in A27D7, as it reversed the loss of binding conferred by Gln117Lys/Leu118Ser mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Beside favoring A27D7 in terms of protectivity for the aforementioned reasons, our study also illustrates how divergent the properties of antibodies targeting a given Ag can be. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have ranked our representative MAbs using various properties, such as binding affinity the location and composition of the epitope, the binding stoichiometry (1 or 2 Fab per A33 dimer), and the tolerance to alanine scanning mutagenesis within the epitope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>The most potent antibody (highest affinity) is not necessarily the top candidate in each category and each MAb may be raised and optimized for a particular property. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>For example, A27D7 is characterized by a &gt;10-fold higher binding affinity for VACV-A33 compared to A2C7 and A20G2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>However, A2C7 and A20G2 present specific binding properties, such as increased MAb clustering resulting from A33 bivalency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>This suggests that when considering a particular antigen, the efficiency of an antibody response most likely relies on the combination and the synergetic effect of different antibodies targeting a specific Ag. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>This added layer of complexity has been so far overlooked, and we hope that its study will be implemented in future protection models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>This could be studied in an in vivo protectivity assay by comparing the responses obtained while using individual MAbs, to those obtained using cocktails combining MAbs with different features, such as discussed above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>The data we obtained using single alanine scanning mutagenesis within the A27D7 antibody epitope may explain why a previous study observed that vaccination with recombinant Sindbis virus expressing A33 VACV conferred protection against ECTV but not CPXV [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>In this case, vaccination might not have elicited anti-A33 antibodies that could bind the Gln173Arg variation found in cowpox. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Residue 173 is adjacent in the A33 crystal structure to residues 117 and 118 and as such topographically part of the CPII region that the authors identified as containing the protective epitope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>We observed a similar effect for A27D7, which bound tighter to our A33 ECTV mimic than to the CPXV counterpart, after mutating this single residue from a Gln to an Arg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>However, while we have not tested if A27D7 can protect against cowpox challenge, binding of the MAb to the cowpox A33 epitope variant is still in the nanomolar range, which we predict to be sufficient to confer protection. </plain></SENT>
