<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is an idiopathic inflammatory condition that involves orbital apex and cavernous sinus manifesting in hemicranial pain, retroorbital or periorbital pain, loss of vision, oculomotor nerve paralysis, and sensory loss in distribution of ophthalmic and maxillary division of trigeminal nerve [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This syndrome complex was originally reported in 1954 by Eduardo Tolosa and the eponym “Tolosa-Hunt syndrome” was applied in 1966 by Smith and Taxdal [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This idiopathic process is thought to be resulting from granulomatous inflammation within cavernous sinus (cavernous sinus syndrome) or orbital apex (orbital apex syndrome). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The International Headache Society defines THS as episodes of steady unilateral orbital pain persisting for days to weeks, if untreated, resulting in paralysis of fourth and/or sixth cranial nerves, oculosympathetic paralysis, and spontaneous remissions and relapses with no demonstrable systemic disease outside the cavernous sinus [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Clinically this syndrome is simulated by multiple other disorders like trauma, vascular malformations, intracranial tumors, intracranial metastases, endocrine disorders, and inflammatory and infectious conditions [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To date, based on our review of literature there are only six reports of THS cases associated with lymphoma so far [6–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of DHL with cavernous sinus involvement mimicking THS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Double-hit B cell lymphoma (DHL) is defined as diffuse large B cell lymphoma with translocations and/or extra signals involving MYC along with BCL2 and/or BCL6 as identified by FISH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In a large series with 129 patients diagnosed with DHL, it was noted that median age was 62 years (range, 18–85), 84% of patients had advanced-stage disease, and 87% had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score ≥2 [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Complete response (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between R-CHOP, R-EPOCH, and R-HyperCVAD/MA (rituximab, hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone, alternating with cytarabine plus methotrexate) regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found lower CR in R-CHOP group compared to R-EPOCH group (odds ratio: 0.33, 95% CI 0.12–0.90, P = 0.031) or compared to R-Hyper CVAD/MA group (odds ratio: 0.30, 95% CI 0.22–0.79, P = 0.015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>EFS and OS rates were also noted to be inferior in R-CHOP group compared to R-EPOCH group (P = 0.008 and P = 0.096). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed that the outcome of patients with DHL is poor with conventional chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Salvage therapies are not clearly defined and do not seem to be effective with or without stem cell transplantation (SCT) suggesting that initial response to induction therapy is essential for long term survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In another study of 39 cases from the Nebraska Lymphoma study group the median overall survival was only 9 months and the 5-year overall survival was 30%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Patients with low IPI scores of 0–2 had a better survival than those with high scores (3–5) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In patients with DHL, higher coexpression of MYC (&gt;30%) and BCL2 (50%) by IHC is found to be an independent predictor of poor survival [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In a recent multicenter survey of 311 patients treated at 23 academic North American centers, the PFS was 10.9 months and the OS was 21.9 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Intensive induction improved PFS but not OS [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Autologous stem cell transplantation did not improve outcomes in patients who achieve complete remission [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Role of targeted agents in DHL is currently being explored and preclinical and clinical studies are underway testing PI3K inhibitors, Aurora kinase inhibitors, and BCL-2 inhibitors [16–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Phase II trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02272686">NCT02272686</ext-link>) of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ibrutinib) after stem cell transplantation is also being considered [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Another phase I/II trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02213913">NCT02213913</ext-link>) is also evaluating the role of lenalidomide when added to DA-R-EPOCH in patients with DHL [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The idea of evaluating therapeutic synergism using new targeted agents and traditional cytotoxic agents seems very exciting and promising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Only randomized trials could shed more light on this. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In summary Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare clinical presentation and mandates thorough diagnostic workup to identify other causes that simulate it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In our patient, initial impression of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, which was made based on clinical presentation and MRI findings, was soon realized to be secondary to lymphomatous infiltration from DHL which preceded systemic relapse as evidenced by FDG PET/CT scan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Lastly, in regard to DHL management, we recommended aggressive induction chemotherapy and participation in clinical trials when available and eligible. </plain></SENT>
