</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The large plant-specific superfamily APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive element-binding Factor (AP2/ERF) includes transcription factors involved in various regulatory pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The highly conserved DNA-binding domain AP2 is shared by all members of the superfamily [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on the number of AP2 domains and the presence of other functional domains, the superfamily is divided into three families: AP2-like/AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), ERF-like and RAV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The AP2-like/ANT family, in which two AP2 domains are present [3], includes proteins that act in multiple stages and tissues during plant development [4], [5], [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison revealed that the AP2-like group can be further divided into AP2 and the RELATED TO AP2 (RAP2) groups [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The ERF-like family and the RAV family are both characterized by a single AP2 domain, and their members are involved in the response to various environmental stresses [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition to the single AP2 domain, the RAV family contains the DNA-binding domain B3 [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The AP2-like proteins (both AP2 and RAP2) are encoded by mRNAs containing a conserved target site for the microRNA miR172 that regulates their activity at the post-transcriptional level, predominantly through mRNA cleavage and translational inhibition [13], [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To date, a number of studies have analyzed the AP2-like genes; the majority of studies have focused on dicots and occasionally monocots (mainly Poaceae) [16], [17], [18], gymnosperms [19], [20], [21] and ferns [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The AP2-like genes are involved in reproductive phase transition and flower development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Within the ABCDE model of flower development [22], [23], [24], [25], the AP2-like genes belong to the A-class and, alone or together with the B-class genes, are mainly involved in the specification of the identity of outer floral whorls (sepals and petals) [4], [22], [26], [27], [28], in ovule, seed and post-embryonic development [4], [29], [30], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The A- and C-class functions are mutually exclusive, even though recent studies conducted in Arabidopsis demonstrated that the balance in expression of these two gene classes, moreso than the presence/absence of their gene products, regulates the correct formation of outer and inner floral whorls [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>AP2-like proteins interact with their specific binding sites located within intron 2 of the C-class AG gene, repressing its expression [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition to their role in flower development, some AP2-like genes are also expressed in vegetative tissues [2], [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The analysis of genes involved in the flower development pathway in model species is of great relevance (e.g., Arabidopsis and Oryza) to the understanding of the general mechanisms that govern the formation of the floral organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, as revealed by the extension of the study of the B- and C-class genes to non-model species (such as orchids), gene functions often do not overlap, completely or in part, between these species and model species [36], [37], [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The family Orchidaceae is one of the largest among the flowering plants and is characterized by highly diversified flowers and reproductive strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The orchid flower is zygomorphic, with three outer tepals, two inner lateral tepals and an inner median tepal called labellum or lip. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The male and female reproductive tissues are fused into a single structure known as column, at the base of which the ovary is located. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The pollen grains (pollinia) are located at its top. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To date, studies of the AP2-like genes in orchids are restricted to species belonging to the subfamily Epidendroideae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The DcruAP2 gene of Dendrobium crumenatum is expressed in all floral organs [40], and the twelve EpAP2-like genes of Erycina pusilla are expressed at different levels in flower and vegetative tissues [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The function of the microRNA mir172 in the cleavage of AP2-like mRNA was also demonstrated in E. pusilla and Phalaenopsis aphrodite (Epidendroideae) [41], [42]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In addition, we verified the presence of cleaved products generated by the interaction of miR172 with its specific target site within the OitaAP2 mRNA, analyzed the expression pattern of miR172 within the floral tissues of O. italica and compared it to that of the OitaAP2 gene. </plain></SENT>
