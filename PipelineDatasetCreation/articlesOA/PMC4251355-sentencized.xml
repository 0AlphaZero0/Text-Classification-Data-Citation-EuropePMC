<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a gammaretrovirus associated with anaemia, immunodeficiency, leukaemia, and lymphoma in cats [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>FeLV has been studied extensively as a model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell lymphoma virus (HTLV) infections [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>FeLV is distributed worldwide; however, prevalence varies greatly with geography and with risk factors that include age, health status, and population density [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A recent study reported FeLV seroprevalence of 5.1% and 18.9% in healthy and sick Malaysian cats, respectively [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, studies carried out in other Asian regions reported 0% FeLV prevalence in Vietnam [5]; 14.7% among cats in Singapore [6]; 2.9% in Japan [7]; and 6% each from Taiwan and Thailand [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In non-Asian countries, FeLV prevalence has been reported to be 4.8% on Prince Edward Island, Canada [10]; 5.3% and 3.7% in Raleigh and Gainesville, USA, respectively [11]; 3.4% in all Canada [12]; and 4.6% in Egypt [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These discrepancies in prevalence of FeLV may arise due to differences in cat's lifestyle and FeLV vaccination practices in different countries [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of FeLV is usually performed by detection of p27 antigen [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, demonstrating p27 antigen is difficult during early viraemia and with latent infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA are better predictors of progressive and latent infections, respectively [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Apart from the envelope gene of FeLV, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) play important role in determining disease outcome and in differentiating exogenous from endogenous FeLV [15, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Vaccination against FeLV is not carried out in Malaysia and, to date, FeLV clinical status of Malaysian cats has not been investigated using molecular assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Additionally, unlike the ubiquitous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [18] sequence and phylogenetic characteristics of the Malaysian FeLV isolates have not been elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study are to evaluate the presence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA in selected antigenaemic and nonantigenaemic cats, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Sequence characteristics, enhancer motifs as well as phylogenetic relationships of the Malaysian FeLV also were determined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Results and Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>FeLV infection is of concern to cat owners due to its ability to induce tumours and immunodeficiency, thus predisposing cats to other secondary diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In this study, a U3-LTR and gag regions of exogenous without endogenous FeLV sequences were amplified by nested PCR methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Post-PCR analysis using electrophoresis revealed an expected amplicon size of 770 bp in the outer PCR and 601 bp in the nested inner PCR assay (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Overall, it was found that 97.4% (38/39) of p27 antigen-negative cats were positive for FeLV provirus DNA suggesting that this category of cats likely goes undetected when only p27 detection is used to judge their FeLV clinical status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Similar studies reported high prevalence of FeLV provirus DNA in Brazilian cats [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, Hofmann-Lehmann et al. [23] reported a lower provirus DNA rate in cats in Switzerland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The observed differences in prevalence among different countries could be associated with cat lifestyle, as well as variations in factors known to favour FeLV transmission [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Provirus DNA detection rate observed in this study could be associated with regressive or latent FeLV infection, which is characterized by integration of DNA provirus into the host cell genome and absence of viral antigen in circulation [1, 15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The consequence of latent FeLV infection is that provirus DNA could reactivate to an infectious state, especially following stress and/or immunosuppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Thus, cats that are p27 antigen-negative, but provirus DNA positive, could serve as sources of infection of FeLV-naïve cats [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>A previous study has established an association between feline lymphoma and provirus DNA positivity in p27 antigen-negative cats, though this has not been evaluated in the present study [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transmission of FeLV has been shown to occur in cats following blood transfusion from cats with provirus DNA, thus highlighting the importance of screening blood donor cats for provirus DNA [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Viral RNA was detected in 87.2% (34/39) of p27 antigen-positive cats whereas 13% (5/39) tested negative using RT-PCR assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Since plasma viral RNA is an indicator of FeLV viraemia, cats that are positive for FeLV p27 antigen and viral RNA are likely to harbour replicating virus [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Cats in this category may progress to a persistent viraemic stage, succumbing to FeLV-associated illness [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Failure to detect FeLV viral RNA in about 13% p27 antigen-positive cats (p27-positive/viral RNA-negative) could result from atypical infection, wherein the virus is sequestered and replicates locally in tissues such as salivary gland, mammary gland, and urinary epithelium, causing intermittent or low-grade antigenaemia, although there is no detectable viraemia [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with the results of an earlier study that failed to isolate FeLV from about 10% of p27 antigen-positive cats, irrespective of the antigen detection methods used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Such cats were considered as “discordant,” suggesting that p27 antigen-positive status may not always correlate with viraemia [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Another potential explanation for p27-positive-RNA-negative status might be false positive antigen or false negative RNA tests that arise occasionally because of low positive predictive value of p27 antigen tests in regions with low FeLV prevalence [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Clinical relevance of atypical FeLV infection is not well-understood, and it has been recommended to monitor the status of discordant cats over time [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>No additional follow-up was carried out in the present study, because most owners were not willing to subject cats to repeated venepunctures [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Based on the U3LTR and partial gag regions, nucleotide sequence analyses revealed homology of 91–100% among Malaysian FeLV isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>However, homology decreased to 84.6% when local isolates were compared with reference isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported strong sequence conservation (&gt;97%) among FeLV isolates of different geographic and temporal clusters [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In agreement with Jackson et al. [17], we do observe point mutations and nucleotide deletion in Malaysian FeLV isolates (see Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/760961">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/760961</ext-link>).While U3LTR is conserved in FeLV, field isolates have been reported to exhibit sequence variation within the terminally repeated LTRs regions [17, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Mutational changes in the LTR regions have been implicated with enhanced transcriptional and/or insertion activities of FeLV, thus supporting T-cell lymphomagenesis [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In this study, several transcription binding motifs were predicted within the amplified U3LTR-gag region (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Of these, NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID motifs were found to be conserved between local FeLV isolates and the two characterized FeLV-Rickard subgroup A and FeLV-FAIDS reference isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, E1A-F, ELP, Sp1, C∖EBPbeta, BAF1, GCF, HNF-3, and PEA3 motifs are found in some local isolates but were absent in reference sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>These motifs may have implication for viral oncogenicity or probably favours viral replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>For example, an Sp1 enhancer, a member of Sp/Kruppel-like factor, was reported to activate gene transcription and contribute to abnormal metabolism of cancer cells [36, 37] whereas C∖EBPbeta regulates the growth and differentiation of myeloid as well as lymphoid cells [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that, the U3-LTR sequence contains multiple transcription binding sites that aid viral replication and pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Interactions of different transcription binding factors, via the U3-LTRs, may contribute to cellular gene transactivation and viral leukemogenesis [39, 40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Enhancer motifs observed in this study appeared in multiple locations such as in the case of E1A-F, BAF1, and TFIID, each occurring in duplicate; GCF appeared in triplicate while AP-2 is repeated 5 times at different positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>An enhancer duplication and triplication has been reported in naturally occurring cases of FeLV-induced T-cell lymphomas [41, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of multiple enhancers in cats used in the present study is not determined, although some FeLV positive cats had evidence of different tumour forms at post-mortem (result not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported that E1A-F, a member ets-oncogene family transcription factor, upregulates the multiple matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes thus contributing to the malignant phenotypic activity by increasing the invasion and metastatic activities of cancerous cells [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>TFIID, a potential protooncogene with TATA-box protein and a TBP-associated factor also plays role in transcription initiation and genome expression [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, AP2 and SP1 are known to activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In addition, overexpression of these gene has been reported to cause cellular transformation [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly we also identified a triplicate of GCF binding factor that has suppressor effect on EGR gene; these discrepancies, however, need further elucidation with quantitative real-time PCR [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Absence of length mutation (nucleotide position 473–481) in Malaysian FeLV isolates, as observed in FeLV isolates from Taiwan (FeLV-TW-25 and FeLV-TW-30) and a European isolate (FeLV-GM1), might suggest limited influence of geography in evolutionary patterns of FeLV, unlike its lentiviral counterpart, feline immunodeficiency virus [33, 48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis based on the U3LTR-gag sequence revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates are closely related (Tables 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c)) but when compared with reference isolates, separated into two distinct clusters, with the majority (86.2%) being closely related to FeLV-K01803 isolate from UK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The remaining local FeLV isolates (13.8%) clustered with FeLV-GM1 (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The reason for the observed similarity between local FeLV isolates and European isolates, but not with Taiwanese isolates, may suggest the lack of geographical influence, this should be explored further. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>It is possible also that FeLV might have been introduced into Malaysia as a result of translocation of domestic pets from Europe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Due to a somewhat conserved nature of the U3LTR region, conclusion about the FeLV subgroup requires further investigations of FeLV envelope protein gene. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Based on the U3LTR-gag sequence, Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly conserved and more closely related to K01803 isolate from UK compared to Taiwanese and other reference isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Presence of multiple enhancers some of which have been linked with FeLV induced tumours may contribute to the development of poor prognostic outcome in naturally infected Malaysian cats although this needs further investigation. </plain></SENT>
