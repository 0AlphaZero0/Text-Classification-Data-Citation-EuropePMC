Recently, rare variants such as copy-number variants and single-nucleotide variants have been a focus of research because of their large effect size associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ and ASD and the possibility of elucidating the pathophysiology of mental disorder through functional analysis of the discovered rare variants. To discover rare variants with large effect size and to evaluate their role in the etiopathophysiology of SCZ and ASD, we sequenced the <italic>RTN4R</italic> coding exons with a sample comprising 370 SCZ and 192 ASD patients, and association analysis using a large number of unrelated individuals (1716 SCZ, 382 ASD and 4009 controls). Through this mutation screening, we discovered four rare (minor allele frequency &#x0003c;1%) missense mutations (R68H, D259N, R292H and V363M) of <italic>RTN4R</italic>. Among these discovered rare mutations, R292H was found to be significantly associated with SCZ (<italic>P</italic>=0.048). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> functional assays showed that the R292H mutation affected the formation of growth cones. This study strengthens the evidence for association between rare variants within <italic>RTN4R</italic> and SCZ, and may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopmental disorder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating psychiatric disorder that is characterized by hallucinations, delusions and cognitive deficits, and which causes tremendous societal burdens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The lifetime prevalence of SCZ is ~1% in the general population.

Furthermore, rare SNVs, discovered from sequencing of susceptibility genes, may have large effect sizes and account for a part of the heritability of SCZ, and could contribute to an understanding of the etiopathophisiology of neurodevelopmental disease through further functional assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Recently, disturbances of neuronal connectivity in both local neural circuits and broad networks of interconnected brain areas have been implicated in SCZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> and white matter, myelin and oligodendrocyte have received increasing attention in terms of their potential role in the etiopathophysiology of SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Thus, the sequencing of myelin-related genes might be a hopeful method for uncovering the etiopathophysiology of SCZ.</p><p>The Reticulon 4 receptor (<italic>RTN4R</italic>) encodes the RTN4 receptor, which is a known receptor subunit for RTN4 that is one of the most potent myelin-associated inhibitor of axon regeneration and structural plasticity in the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> RTN4R is considered to be a promising candidate gene for SCZ and ASD because <italic>RTN4R</italic> is located at chr22q11.2, which is a hotspot locus for SCZ and ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Carriers with chr22q11.2 deletion exhibit a 20&#x02013;30% prevalence for SCZ, and this deletion is one of the highest known risk factors for SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> RTN4R is known to form a co-receptor complex with other proteins such as immunoglobulin domain-containing protein (LINGO1),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> p75, and tumor necrosis factor receptor orphan Y (TROY),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> thereby activating the Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> This activation initiates a cascade of intracellular molecular events that results in the destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and leads to the collapse of growth cones, preventing further axonal growth and inhibiting myelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, during development, there is evidence that RTN4R is involved in limiting the critical period of experience-driven plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and restricts synapse development in the hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Thus, RTN4-related signaling may act to stabilize brain wiring both in adulthood and during development and may relate to both learning and memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Moreover, mice lacking RTN4R exhibit reduced working memory function, consistent with an end phenotype of SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> In addition, the SNP (rs701428) in <italic>RTN4R</italic> is associated with the internal capsule of SCZ based on a diffusion tensor imaging study of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup></p><p>Considering that RTN4R is strongly related to the neurodevelopment and is located at 22q11.2, we hypothesized that variants in RTN4R possibly contribute to ASD and SCZ susceptibility.

Subjects with a legal measure of reduced capacity were excluded. Control subjects were healthy volunteers from the general public who had no history of mental disorders, based on questionnaire responses from the subjects themselves during the sample inclusion step, and based on an unstructured diagnostic interview done by an experienced psychiatrist during the blood collection step; this was ascertained during face-to-face interviews where subjects were asked whether they had suffered episodes of depression, mania or psychotic experiences or if they had received treatment for any psychotic disorders.

Therefore, to examine the effect of R292H on neurodevelopment, a growth cone collapse assay was performed in response to the myelin ligand; RTN4, which requires RTN4R expression. We first generated RTN4R mutant plasmids (R292H, R119W and R196H) and examined their subcellular localization in HEK293 cells. There were no obvious differences in subcellular localization between RTN4R wild type (WT) and the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We then investigated the effects of these mutants on growth cone collapse in chick retinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Consistent with a previous study, RTN4R-R119W,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> which is also in the RTN4 ligand-binding site, also significantly decreased RTN4-induced growth cone collapse compared with RTN4R-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>Based on <italic>in silico</italic> 3D protein structure analysis, we predicted that R292 could be located at the site of interactions between RTN4R and LINGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), which is also an SCZ candidate gene and is known to build a receptor complex with RTN4R and regulate myelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> RTN4R-R292 is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with LINGO1-Q404 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Through association analysis, a marginally significant association (OR=3.9, <italic>P</italic>=0.048) was detected between SCZ and RTN4R-R292H in a sample comprising 6095 unrelated individuals. This result is consistent with the recent genetic studies using large samples of neurodevelopmental disorders; deleterious rare mutations with large effect size are highly enriched in SCZ and ASD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, we found a possible biological effect of RTN4R-R292H by investigating growth cone collapse of chick-dissociated retinal neurons induced by a myelin ligand (RTN4).

Through these genetic and functional studies, considering that <italic>RTN4R</italic> is located at chr22q11.2, which is a hotspot locus for SCZ and ASD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> RTN4R-R292H could be related to the etiopathological role of SCZ, because the pathophysiology of SCZ is believed to be that of aberrant conditions of neurodevelopment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup></p><p>We could get the DNA from the daughter of Subject 2 who was diagnosed with SCZ, and showed that she was also an RTN4R-R292H carrier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).

Given the fact that SCZ is a disorder of complex genetics with an environmental component, it is not surprising that RTN4R-R292H does not fully reproduce the disease. Functional change of RTN4R-R292H throughout neurodevelopment could possibly increase the SCZ risk.</p><p>Several limitations should be discussed when interpreting the results of this study. Firstly, our sequencing did not cover the several potentially informative regions of RTN4R, including untranslated regions and intronic regions. Indeed, it has recently been reported that <italic>de novo</italic> synonymous mutations in the gene SETD1A could contribute to the genetic etiology of SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Secondly, due to limited access to the detailed clinical phenotypes of the subject and subjects&#x02019; family members and control subjects with RTN4R-R292H, and to lack of DNA samples from subjects&#x02019; family, we could not fully explore the impact of the novel variants segregation. Third, we only discovered a reduction of growth cone collapse by RTN4R-R292H with chick retinal neurons in E5.5. Due to the reduced transfection efficiency in later embryonic period (that is, E8), we could not assess effects of variant in terms of pathophysiological mechanism based on dominant negative or gain-of-function model during the high expression of RTN4R (that is, E13). Finally, the mechanisms of how R292H leads to pathophysiology of the SCZ are left unanswered. Therefore, the potential effect of RTN4R-R292H on cortical neurons and on the RhoA signaling should be investigated in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, individuals with the RTN4R-R292H might increase susceptibility to developing SCZ. Furthermore, we revealed the biological effect of inhibiting myelin-mediated neurite sprouting by the mutation of RTN4R-R292H.
