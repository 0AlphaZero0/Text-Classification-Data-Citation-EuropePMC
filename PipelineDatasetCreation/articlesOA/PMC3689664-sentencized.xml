</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It accounted for 14% (903,500) of the total new cancer cases and 6% (258,400) of the total cancer deaths in males in 2008 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Generally, prostate cancer is known to be a multifactorial disease induced by complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Hormonal factors also play a fundamental role in the progression of prostate cancer through estrogen synthesis, metabolism and signal transduction pathways [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, evidences point to genetic factors, such as variations in hormonal gene, as the key players in prostate cancer development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Currently, a wide range of genes have been identified have some risk associations with prostate cancer, such as AR, CYP17/19, NOS, PSA, ESR1/2, etc [4]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) is located on chromosome 6, locus 6p25.1 and spans approximately 300 kb in length, including 8 exons and 7 introns [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>ESR1 functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor composed of several domains important for hormone binding, DNA binding, as well as activation of transcriptions; it can also interact with estrogens receptors to stimulate proliferation of mammary epithelial tissue and alter the expression of downstream genes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Generally, ESR1 is implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility by stimulating aberrant prostate growth, controlling prostate cell growth and programming prostate cell death [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recently, several ESR1 gene polymorphisms have been identified as candidates for prostate cancer susceptibility and among these, ESR1 PvuII (rs2234693 C&gt;T) and XbaI (rs9340799 A&gt;G) polymorphisms were suggested to possess significant associations with the development of prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Both PvuII and XbaI can affect ESR1 transcription activity and possibly contribute to the elevated risk of prostate cancer [3], [6], [16], but the exact effects of ESR1 gene mutations on prostate epithelial cells are still debated despite the fact that estrogen is already used in treatming prostate cancer due to its growth-inhibitory effects [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A recent case-control study observed no associations between the selected genetic polymorphisms of ESR1 and prostate cancer risk [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Sun et al also suggested that common genetic variations in ESR1 did not strongly correlate with prostate cancer aggressiveness and they also indicated that the polymorphisms of ESR1 may have no biological functions [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The inconsistent conclusions to link ESR1 gene mutations with the risk of prostate cancer may be due to the limitations in sample size in the corresponding investigations, of in the inadequate statistical power in genetic studies of complex traits, like age, ethnicity, gender, the histological type, differentiation on tumor stage and research methodology [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of all eligible case-control studies with prostate cancer risk and aimed to reveal a more precise relationship between ESR1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Such relationship will shed light on a comprehensive functional profiling of ESR1 gene for better understanding of the biological processes associated with prostate cancer formation and progression [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, identification of common polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene may be useful in early diagnosis of prostate cancer, allowing patients to receive timely and effective anti-cancer therapies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="636" pm="."><plain>The associations between ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism and prostate cancer risk were investigated in six studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="637" pm="."><plain>The heterogeneity was not obvious under all genetic models (all P&gt;0.05), so fixed effects model was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="638" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism and prostate cancer risk under any genetic models (G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.98–1.22, P = 0.118; GG + AG vs. AA: OR = 1.14, 95%CI: 0.98–1.34, P = 0.089; GG vs. AA + AG: OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.86–1.34, P = 0.523; GG vs. AA: OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 0.92–1.55, P = 0.174; GG vs. AG: OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.82–1.30, P = 0.797; respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="639" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, the results indicated that ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism might significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer among African populations (G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.00–2.57, P = 0.049; GG + AG vs. AA: OR = 2.15, 95%CI: 1.12–4.13, P = 0.022; respectively), but not enough reliability was established due to the estimation of effect size from a single study [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="640" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism did not show any statistical association with the risk of prostate cancer among Caucasian and Asian populations (all P&gt;0.05) (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="641" pm="."><plain>Results from the subgroup analysis by country showed that ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism was slightly correlated with increased risk of prostate cancer among American population under the allele model (G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.00–1.30, P = 0.045), but not among Japanese and Indian populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="951" pm="."><plain>Estrogen plays an important role in the expression of genes that regulate hormone levels, normal prostate developments and prostate diseases [24], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="952" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expressions or mutations of hormone receptors in cancer cells were also found to be associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="953" pm="."><plain>Additionally, inherited variants in sex hormonal receptor genes may perhaps interact with other variants in the steroidogenic and metabolic pathways cooperatively [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="954" pm="."><plain>Therefore, hormonal status is clearly an important factor in prostate cancer biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="955" pm="."><plain>Estrogen exerts its effects on prostatic tissues by binding to and activating estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="956" pm="."><plain>Estrogen receptor (ESR1) is involved in sex steroid metabolism and functions in carrying out the proper cellular responses [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="957" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidences also indicate that estrogen and estrogen receptors play crucial roles in prostate cancer development and progression [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="958" pm="."><plain>ESR1 is expressed in prostate stromal cells and is thought to stimulate growth factor release and cause epithelial cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="959" pm="."><plain>Ricke et al suggested that it is likely an imbalance of their expression may be critical in determining the effects that estrogen ultimately has on prostate cancer cells [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="960" pm="."><plain>However, a recent genetic study showed that mutations in ESR1 were independent risk factors [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="961" pm="."><plain>Human ESR1 encoding gene is located on chromosome 6q24–27, consists of eight exons and seven introns, and is about 140 kb in length with two promoter regions and five functional domains, designated as A/B–F, in two differing transcripts at the 5′ region [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="962" pm="."><plain>The protein itself has 595 amino acids and weights a molecular weight of 66,182 Da [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="963" pm="."><plain>In the normal prostate, ESR1 is expressed in stromal cells but not in epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="964" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it has been discovered that ESR1 is expressed in the epithelium in malignant prostate tissues [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="965" pm="."><plain>ESR1 gene mutations may alter the concentration of reactive estrogens in the prostate [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="966" pm="."><plain>Several polymorphisms in ESR1 gene, such as PvuII (rs9340799 A&gt;G) and XbaI (rs2234693 C&gt;T), have been studied to a assess their causal relationships with prostate cancer [23], [25], [37], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="967" pm="."><plain>It appears that inherited alterations of the ESR1 gene can possibly explain interpopulation differences in the incidences associated with estrogen-related diseases [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="968" pm="."><plain>Many investigations have demonstrated that prostate cancer risk was associated with the ESR1 gene polymorphism [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="969" pm="."><plain>To explore the association between ESR1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis on 2,165 prostate cancer cases and 3,361 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="970" pm="."><plain>This is the first meta-analysis exploring the relationship between prostate cancer and the ESR1 gene polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="971" pm="."><plain>When all the eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, the results showed that ESR1 PvuII (C&gt;T) and XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of prostate cancer, yet many studies have inferred that ESR1 gene polymorphisms were related to the onset and develop of prostate cancer [11], [12], [26], [37], [41]–[43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="972" pm="."><plain>A possible reason for the controversy is that a considerable degree of heterogeneity existed among the other studies due to differences in sample sizes, exposure estimates, ethnicity, source of controls and other potential confounding variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="973" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a stratified analysis based on ethnicity and country. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="974" pm="."><plain>The results showed that ESR1 PvuII (C&gt;T) polymorphism might increase the risk of prostate cancer among Asian populations, especially among Indian population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="975" pm="."><plain>ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism was confirmed to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer among American population under the allele model, but not among Japanese and Indian populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="976" pm="."><plain>However, pooled estimates for Indian population was slightly higher than that for American population, and only pooled OR under the allele model was significant and might lead to unacceptably low levels of statistical power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="977" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this result should be verified by large, well-designed epidemiologic population-based studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="978" pm="."><plain>Ethnic differences in prostate cancer susceptibility are probably the results of both genetic and epidemiological factors, which may mainly be the results of genetic factors including mutations in rare genes that confer high risks and/or mutations in specific genes that confer modestly increased risks [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="979" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also performed a pooled analysis for all eligible case-control studies to explore the role of codon 10 (T&gt;C), codon 325 (C&gt;G), codon 594 (G&gt;A) and +261G&gt;C polymorphisms in prostate cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="980" pm="."><plain>However, no significant associations between these SNPs and prostate cancer risk were observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="981" pm="."><plain>In interpreting the results of the current meta-analysis, some limitations need to be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="982" pm="."><plain>First, the sample size is still relatively small and may not provide sufficient power to estimate the association between ESR1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="983" pm="."><plain>Second, heterogeneity across studies was obvious, which might be a result of the difference in ethnicity, country, source of controls and genotype methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="984" pm="."><plain>Third, the selection bias may exist because only articles published in English or Chinese were included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="985" pm="."><plain>Besides, our meta-analysis was also based on unadjusted ORs estimates because not all published studies presented adjusted ORs, or when they were, the ORs were not adjusted by the same potential confounders, such as ethnicity, age, gender, geographic distribution, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="986" pm="."><plain>Although no obvious publication bias was identified, potential bias cannot be completely ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="987" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is well acknowledged that many other factors, such as gene-gene or gene-environment interactions may affect the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="988" pm="."><plain>Finally, although all cases and controls of each study were well defined with similar inclusion criteria, there may be potential factors that were not taken into account that could have influenced our results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="989" pm="."><plain>In spite of these limitations, our meta-analysis still had some merits and values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="990" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on the relationship of ESR1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="991" pm="."><plain>It is worthwhile to mention that we also established an efficient searching strategy based on computer-assisted programs and manual searches, which allowed us to include as many studies as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="992" pm="."><plain>According to our selection criteria, the quality of studies included in this meta-analysis is sufficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="993" pm="."><plain>Explicit methods for study selection, data extraction, and data analysis were well designed before initiating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="994" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was no evidence of publication bias in this meta-analysis and the sensitivity analysis indicated that the results are statistically robust. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="995" pm="."><plain>In summary, this meta-analysis suggested that ESR1 PvuII (C&gt;T) polymorphism may be a potential risk factor for prostate cancer among Asian populations, especially among Indian population; while ESR1 XbaI (A&gt;G) polymorphism may increase the risk of prostate cancer among American population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="996" pm="."><plain>Such relationship can provide a more comprehensive mechanism of how ESR1 mutations function in the development of prostate cancer, as well as promise a more effective treatment for prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="997" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are still needed to warrant and validate the association between ESR1 gene polymorphism with other genetic polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
