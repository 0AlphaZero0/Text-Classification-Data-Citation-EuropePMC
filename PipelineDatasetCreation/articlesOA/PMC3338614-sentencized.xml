</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Establishing high-resolution, causative mapping of specific protein function and cell response is a critical facet underlying success in genetics, systems biology, drug discovery, and molecular biotechnology [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This task is challenging for multifunctional proteins that contain diverse functionalities including protein and DNA interactions and catalytic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These proteins play critical roles in epigenetic modification, signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When relying upon commonly invoked approaches (such as gene deletions), it is difficult to directly link one particular function of these proteins (such as catalytic activity or a specific protein-protein interaction) to downstream gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The reason for this difficulty is that coarse modifications like knockouts remove the entire protein and thus all of its functions, thereby creating an environment for non-natural associations or activity compensations that confound data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this regard, gene knockout studies probe cellular response and compensation, not necessarily precise protein function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While alternative strategies to gene deletion have been used [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], all of these methods result in pleiotropic effects that do not specifically isolate the multiple functionalities inherent in proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a unique, graded dominant mutant approach to enable the systems biology study of a yeast histone acetyltransferase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The yeast histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Gcn5p, is a multifunctional protein with catalytic and binding domains (including Ada2 interaction and a bromodomain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A causative study of acetyltransferase activity thus requires a removal or reduction of catalytic function while maintaining native protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>HAT proteins are important targets of genetic studies since they are critical for establishing acetylation of histones, which have long been recognized as a mark of euchromatin and an important activating genomic modification [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The yeast gene, GCN5, encodes a histone acetyltransferase that serves as a well-studied prototype [10], [11], [12] for transcription-associated HAT activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Gcn5p has a known crystal structure [13] and direct homologues in higher eukaryotic systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Only a small number of Gcn5p putative gene targets have been identified even though it is presumed that this HAT globally controls gene expression [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as this HAT is nonessential like many epigenetic factors, inherent protein redundancy implies that other HAT proteins may compensate for Gcn5p in its absence and thus confound data relying on knockout studies alone. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Some attempts have been made to specifically inhibit catalytic activity of similar epigenetic proteins through inhibitors including nucleotide analogues [15], [16] and other small molecules [17], [18], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, inhibitors are difficult to design de novo, lack single target specificity, are limited in their concentration ranges, and often have a lower than anticipated response rate [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Classically, dominant mutations have been widely used to probe gene function, [21] improve tolerances and drug resistances, [22], [23], [24] characterize disease states, [25], [26], [27], [28] and map protein functional domains [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this regard, small point mutations can abolish a particular function in isolation without disrupting other protein activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Here, we exploit the inhibitory nature of dominant mutations and demonstrate that varying the expression level of a non-catalytic dominant mutant in the presence of the native, wild-type allele can specifically isolate and titer the catalytic activity of the wild type protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Despite the common use of dominant mutants, no prior study has paired these alleles with a promoter library to specifically and quantitatively grade an isolated protein function and collect systems level information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate the power of a graded dominant mutant approach to isolate and causatively study the histone acetyltransferase catalytic activity of Gcn5p protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in doing so, uncover previously unknown gene targets and functions of Gcn5p. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We first sought to study the influence of Gcn5p-based acetylation using a dominant mutant allele, gcn5-F221A, based on prior evidence of absent in vitro acetylation activity [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We observed that this allele failed to complement a BY4741 gcn5 null strain in vivo (Figure S1) and determined it to possess no changes to Gibbs Free energy using Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies [31], indicating a conservation of protein structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Alongside these tests, a second catalytically inactive, dominant mutant (gcn5-E173A) was likewise constructed and tested (Discussion S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This second mutant also competitively inhibited native Gcn5p acetyltransferase activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In order to create quantitative, graded expression of these dominant alleles, expression (and thus level of competitive inhibition) was modulated through the use of a promoter library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Expression of the mutant allele was established by cloning gcn5-F221A into centromeric yeast expression vectors under the control of a collection of mutant TEF-based promoters with previously established expression capacities [32], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This library resulted in a ratio of mutant to wild-type expression ranging from 2.5 fold with the weakest promoter to 8–10 fold with the strongest promoter (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Three genetic tests were used to establish and validate the gradation and competition of catalytic activity by this mutant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The first test involved the HIS3 locus, a known acetylation target for Gcn5p [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Gene activation of HIS3 by Gcn5p-based acetylation enables higher tolerance to a histidine analogue, 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In a gcn5Δ strain, HIS3 expression is decreased, leading to amino acid starvation in the presence of 3-AT and decreased cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Each expression cassette controlling gcn5-F221A was transformed into S. cerevisiae S288C and growth rate was evaluated in the presence of 3-AT ( Fig. 1a ). Strains with low expression of the mutant allele most-closely resembled the wild-type strain, whereas at higher expression levels, strains resembled that of the gcn5 null strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Transcription of HIS3 was found to decrease in a manner that followed a competitive inhibition curve ( Fig. 1b ). This data provides strong evidence that the gcn5-F221A allele competes for Gcn5p acetylation sites in the HIS3 promoter region and effectively decreases HIS3 transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>While the growth rate trend ( Fig. 1a ) shows a clear correlation between mutant expression and growth rate, the trend is linear rather than an inhibition curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We believe this arises from the more indirect measurement of growth rate, which is impacted by many cellular and environmental factors, and therefore integrates multiple signals, not just HIS3 expression levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>By comparison, the measurement of HIS3 mRNA levels ( Fig. 1b ) is a more direct measurement and thus presents the more expected competitive inhibition curve. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Using a graded dominant mutant approach and Gcn5p as a case study, we are able to determine global gene targets and impacts, and to extract the causative linkage between the catalytic domain of Gcn5p and gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In particular, we (1) find evidence that Gcn5p is more involved in cell-wide gene repression, instead of the accepted gene activation associated with HATs, (2) identify previously unknown gene targets and interactions for Gcn5p-based acetylation, (3) quantify the strength of some Gcn5p-DNA associations, (4) demonstrate that this approach can be used to correctly identify canonical chromatin modifications, (5) establish the role of acetyltransferase activity on synthetic lethal interactions, and (6) identify new functional classes of genes regulated by Gcn5p acetyltransferase activity—all six of these major conclusions were unattainable by using standard gene knockout studies alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the power of the graded dominant mutant approach, which unlike traditional methods, only impacts one particular facet of the querying protein (in this case, acetyltransferase activity) and is therefore especially useful for studying multifunctional proteins and global regulators. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Despite the common conception that Gcn5p-based acetylation is gene activating, we posit that Gcn5p-based acetylation serves a dominant role in maintaining global gene repression in yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>We found that over-expression of a catalytically inactive dominant mutant led to up regulation of 66% of affected genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This finding is unexpected and not evident from traditional knockout experiments, as gene expression changes in the knockout strain were equally distributed between over and under expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This is the first time that Gcn5p-based acetylation has been implicated with global gene repression, and may be a direct function of Gcn5p or an indirect result of additional gene regulators that are controlled by Gcn5p. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Our global microarray study identifies a set of 44 ‘opposite’ genes, whose expression in the presence of the catalytically inactive dominant mutant is opposite that of expression in a gcn5Δ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of this set of genes indicates that nearly half are shown to be associated with the SAGA complex in an independent study [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>It is likely that this ‘opposite’ phenomena is due to the partitioning of Gcn5p function and targeting across the domains (potentially the catalytic and bromodomains). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In the case of the graded dominant, targeting of the SAGA complex can still occur and thus transcription is increased at these genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>However, in a gene knockout, the entire Gcn5p transcriptional coactivator is missing and thus transcription is impeded significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Underacetylated H4 histone proteins have also been shown to have a biased association with SAGA-regulated genes [39], further solidifying the SAGA-complex link to these opposite genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>These results provides another example that removing a globally functioning protein like Gcn5p results in an artificial genetic background with misleading observations regarding true protein-DNA interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these results highlight how novel hypotheses of function can be deduced from this approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Based on the results presented here, we would recommend that a graded dominant mutant approach be utilized in conjunction with a traditional gene knockout to study gene regulatory proteins, especially those that serve multiple functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The resulting data is higher-resolution and more accurately defines protein domain function and influence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>While demonstrated here for the case of acetyltransferase activity of the yeast protein Gcn5p, this approach can theoretically be extended to other proteins and domains of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>By creating two distinct Gcn5p dominant mutants that could both be graded and competitively inhibit native Gcn5p, we demonstrated that this approach is easily implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This approach uniquely enables a systems biology view of the cell while at the same time leveraging synthetic biology tools [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The identification of dominant mutations that can remove single functions are either well-documented for many proteins of interest or can be identified with the proper genetic screens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Additionally, promoter libraries with documented expression capacity are available for most major model systems [32], [49], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Thus, this approach is generalizable for other proteins in classes such as epigenetic modification, signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulation as well as for essential genes, which cannot be deleted, and this method is not necessarily restricted to the yeast system studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In addition, this approach can be combined with any cell state assay including, but not limited to, gene expression analysis, phenotypic assays, genetic screens, ChIP analysis, and metabolomics. </plain></SENT>
