<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic software for non-programmers is traditionally implemented for user convenience in monolithic applications with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) (Smith et al., 1994; Stothard, 2000; Rampp et al., 2006; Librado and Rozas, 2009; Waterhouse et al., 2009; Gouy et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the monolithic application paradigm is easily outscaled by today's big biological data, particularly Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data at gigabyte- and terabyte-scales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Better empowerment of non-programmers for genome-scale analytics of big biological data has been achieved through web-based genome browser interfaces (Markowitz et al., 2014; Cunningham et al., 2015; Rosenbloom et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, for smaller datasets, sequence and alignment editor applications encourage manual manipulation of data, which is error-prone and essentially irreproducible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To reduce error and increase reproducibility in the publishing of bioinformatic and biostatistical protocols it is important to facilitate the documentation and automation of data science workflows through scripts and literate programming facilities (Knuth, 1984) such as emacs org-mode (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</ext-link>), as demonstrated in, for example (Delescluse et al., 2012) that both completely document and encode scientific workflows for machine processing of biological data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility in bioinformatics and biostatistics protocols is crucial to maintaining public trust in the value of its investments in high-throughput and high-dimensional measurements of complex biological systems (Baggerly and Coombes, 2009; Hutson, 2010; Baggerly and Coombes, 2011; Huang and Gottardo, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In one analysis, only two of 18 published microarray gene-expression analyses were completely reproducible, in part because key analysis steps were made with proprietary closed-source software (Ioannidis et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even though analytical errors are a major source of retractions in the scientific literature (Casadevall et al., 2014), peer-review and publication of scientific data processing protocols is generally not yet required to publish scientific studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Adequate documentation of bioinformatic and biostatistical workflows and open source sharing of code upon publication (Peng, 2009) facilitates crowd-sourced verification, correction and extension of code-based analyses (Barnes, 2010; Morin et al., 2012), and reuse of software and data to enable more scientific discovery returns from public data (Peng, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Peer review and publication of the data science protocols associated to scientific studies stems temptation to overinterpret results and encourages more objectivity in data science (Boulesteix, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The ultimate remedy for these problems is to expand literacy in modern computational and statistical data science for science students in general (Morin et al., 2012; Joppa et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Web-based open-source workflow suites such as Galaxy (Blankenberg and Hillman-Jackson, 2014), Taverna (Oinn et al., 2006) and BioExtract (Lushbough et al., 2011) are a recent innovation in the direction of greater reproducibility in bioinformatics protocols for genome-scale analytics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, the most powerful, transparent and customizable medium for reproducible bioinformatics work is only available to bioinformatics specialists and programmers through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) such as BioPerl and Ensembl (Yates et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Yet workflow design suites and programming APIs require dedication and time to learn. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>There is a need for more bioinformatics software in between GUIs and APIs, that empowers non-programmer scientists and researchers to interactively and reproducibly control, process and analyze their data without manual interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Closer inspection of data and interactive construction and control of data workflows makes it so much easier to rapidly prototype error-free workflows, nipping errors in the bud that can completely confound downstream analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In scientific computing, the time-tested paradigm for rapid prototyping of reproducible data workflows is the Unix command-line. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this tradition we here present FAST: FAST Analysis Sequences Toolbox, modeled after the standard Unix toolkit (Peek, 2001), now called Coreutils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The FAST tools follow the Unix philosophy to “do one thing and do it well” and “write programs to work together.” (Stutz, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>FAST workflows are completely automated; no manual interventions to data are required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>FAST falls between a GUI and an API, because it is used through a Command-Line Interface (CLI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although the FAST tools are written in Perl using BioPerl packages (Stajich et al., 2002), FAST users do not need to be able to program Perl or know BioPerl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>FAST users only need basic competence in Unix and the modest skill to compose command pipelines in the Unix shell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>FAST therefore supports an emerging movement to empower non-programmer biologists to learn Unix for scientific computing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Books and courses in this emerging market include the recent “UNIX and Perl to the Rescue!” (Bradnam and Korf, 2012) and the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Foundations workshops (Wilson, 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Unix command pipe-lines are the paradigmatic example of the “pipes and filters” design pattern that embodies serial processing of data through sequences of modular and reuseable computations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The “pipes and filters” design pattern is a special case of component-based software engineering (McIlroy, 1969) and a core paradigm in software architecture (Garlan and Shaw, 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The component-wise organization of FAST affords access to an infinite variety of customizable queries and workflows on biological sequence data using a small command vocabulary and combinatorial logic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Component-based software is easier to learn, maintain and extend. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It also makes it easy for users to interactively develop new protocols through the modular extension and recombination of existing protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>As shown from the examples below, non-trivial computations may be expressed on a single line of the printed page. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Thus, FAST can help empower non-biologist programmers to develop and communicate powerful and reproducible bioinformatic workflows for scientific investigations and publishing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Open-source command-line utilities for bioinformatics such as the EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000), the FASTX tools (Gordon, 2009) or the scripts that come with BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002) typically offer suites of tools with simple, well-defined functions that lend themselves to scripting, but are not necessarily designed according to the Unix toolbox philosophy specifically to interoperate through serial composition over pipes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Similarly, FaBox (Villesen, 2007) is a free and open online server with functions that overlap with FAST tools, but is not designed for serial composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the Unix toolbox model has been used before in more or less more specialized bioinformatics applications such as the popular SAMTools suite (Li et al., 2009) and in the processing of NMR data (Delaglio et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A toolsuite called bp-utils, with a similar design philosophy and some overlapping functionality with FAST, has recently been released at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diverge.hunter.cuny.edu/labwiki/Bioutils">http://diverge.hunter.cuny.edu/labwiki/Bioutils</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We have written extensive documentation for each FAST utility along with useful error messages following recommended practice (Seemann, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>FAST is free and open source; its code is freely available to anyone to re-use, verify and extend through its GitHub repository. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Design and implementation of FAST tools </plain></SENT>
</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>2.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The FAST data model </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The Unix Coreutils paradigm allows users to treat plain-text files and data streams as databases in which records correspond to single lines containing fields separated by delimiters such as commas, tabs, or strings of white-space characters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>FAST extends this paradigm to biological sequence data, allowing users to treat collections of files and streams of multi-line sequence records as databases for complex queries, transformations and analytics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>FAST generalizes the GNU Coreutils model exactly because it models sequence record descriptions as an ordered collection of description fields (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Another design feature of Unix tools that also characterizes the FAST tools is their ability to accept input not only from one or more files but also from what is called standard input, a data-stream supported by the Unix shell, and to output analogously to standard output. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It is this facility that allows FAST tools to be serially composed in Unix pipelines that compactly represent an infinite variety of expressive bioinformatic workflows. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The default data exchange format for FAST tools is the universally recognized FastA format (Lipman and Pearson, 1985). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>While no universal standard exists for this format, for FAST, “FastA format” means what is conventionally called “multi-fasta” format of sequence or alignment data, largely as implementated in BioPerl in the module Bio::SeqIO::fasta (Stajich et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In the FAST implementation of FastA format, multiple sequence records may appear in a single file or input stream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Sequence data may contain gap characters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The logical elements (or fields) of a sequence record are its identifier, its description and its sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The identifier (indicated with id in the illustration below) and description (desc) together make the identifier line of a sequence record, which must begin with the sequence record start symbol &gt; on a single line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The description begins after the first block of white-space on this line (indicated with &lt;space&gt;). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The sequence of a record appears immediately after its identifier line and may continue over multiple lines until the next record starts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In FAST, users may alter how description fields are defined in sequence records by using Perl-style regular expressions to define delimiters (indicated by &lt;delim&gt;). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>FAST uses one-based indexing of description fields. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The FAST data model is illustrated as follows: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><preformat>&gt;seq1-id&lt;space&gt;seq1-desc-field1
 &lt;delim&gt;seq1-desc-field2&lt;delim&gt;...
seq1-sequence
seq1-sequence
...
seq1-sequence
&gt;seq2-id&lt;space&gt;seq2-desc-field1
 &lt;delim&gt;seq2-desc-field2&lt;delim&gt;...
seq2-sequence
seq2-sequence
...
seq2-sequence</preformat><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In FAST, the sequence identifier is thought of as the 0th field of the identifier line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>One-based indexing of description fields in FAST is therefore consistent with zero-based indexing in Perl and one-based indexing of sequence coordinates, making all indexing consistent and uniform in FAST. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Most FAST tools extend the field-based paradigm further by supporting tagged values in sequence record descriptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Tagged values are name-value pairs with a format “name=value" as common in General Feature Format (GFF) used in sequence annotation (see e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/">https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/</ext-link>) or an alternative “name:value” format that certain FAST tools themselves can annotate in-line into sequence records by appending a new field to sequence record descriptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Support for tagged values in FAST makes it possible to operate on sequence records with unordered or heterogeneous description fields. </plain></SENT>
