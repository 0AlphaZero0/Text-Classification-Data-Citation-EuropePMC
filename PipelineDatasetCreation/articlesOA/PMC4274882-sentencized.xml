</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In plant cells, chloroplasts are one of the many types of plastids, which play crucial roles in photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways including amino acid and lipid synthesis, and nitrogen and sulfur assimilation (Keeling, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, assembly of the correct plastid proteome is crucial for proper functioning of plants and their responses to developmental and external cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In spite of the presence of a plastid genome, the vast majority of plastid proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins (preproteins), and post-translationally imported into the organelle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The targeting and translocation processes are facilitated by information embedded within the N-terminal sequences of preproteins, known as transit peptides (TPs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the cytosol, preproteins associate with chaperones (i.e., HSP70 and HSP90; Zhang and Glaser, 2002; Qbadou et al., 2006; Ruprecht et al., 2010) and cochaperones (e.g., HOP and FKBP; Fellerer et al., 2011), and it has been reported that some TPs can be phosphorylated serving as putative binding motifs for 14-3-3 dimers (Waegemann and Soll, 1996; May and Soll, 2000; Martin et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>At the chloroplast surface, preprotein translocation across the envelope is mediated by the coordinate action of two multiprotein complexes, commonly known as the Translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts (Toc) and the Translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (Tic). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The core Toc complex is composed of two GTPases (i.e., Toc159 and Toc34) and a β-barrel protein channel (i.e., Toc75). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The two GTPases are also known as the Toc receptors for their cooperative role in controlling the recognition of preproteins, and regulation of preprotein transfer to the translocation channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>TP binding at the GTPase domains (i.e., G-domains) of the Toc GTPases triggers changes in receptor dimerization, GDP/GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis, ultimately resulting in precursor protein transfer to Toc75 (see Richardson et al., 2014 for review). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Despite the homology of the GTPase domains of Toc159 and Toc34, the former has an additional N-terminal acidic domain (i.e., A-domain), which is intrinsically unstructured and highly divergent among isoforms, implicating its ability to distinguish between a wide variety of substrates (Richardson et al., 2009; Dutta et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis thaliana, the major (i.e., atToc159) and minor (i.e., atToc90, atToc120, and atToc132) isoforms have been hypothesized to be responsible for the recognition of photosynthetic and housekeeping preproteins, respectively (Ivanova et al., 2004; Kubis et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004; Infanger et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, swapping and yeast-two hybrid studies confirmed that the A-domain of Toc159 is an important determinant of substrate selectivity of the Toc complex (Inoue et al., 2010; Dutta et al., 2014), although, selectivity appears to be conferred by information intrinsic to each preprotein TP, rather than by the function of the protein in chloroplasts (Dutta et al., 2014; Grimmer et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the G-domains might constitute a molecular switch as elucidated in many other intracellular protein sorting and translocation processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of Toc34 G-domain has led to the unraveling of its dimerization properties and functions (Sun et al., 2002; Koenig et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While recent biochemical analyses have revealed the relevance of preprotein binding to homodimer dissociation and nucleotide exchange of Toc34 (Oreb et al., 2011), the heterodimeric interaction is crucial for the insertion of Toc159 into the Toc complex with Toc34 serving as a docking site (Bauer et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2002a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a single transmembrane α-helix which anchors Toc34 to the chloroplast surface (Kessler et al., 1994; Seedorf et al., 1995), the absence of any hydrophobic cluster raises a question regarding how Toc159 integrates into the chloroplast outer membrane (Bölter et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Conventionally, the entire C-terminal domain (e.g. ~52 kDa in Pisum sativum) of the tripartite Toc159 has been referred to as “membrane domain” (i.e., M-domain) solely for its resistance to proteolysis in intact chloroplasts, which implies that it is embedded in a hydrophobic environment (Waegemann et al., 1992; Hirsch et al., 1994; Bauer et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Previously, Lee et al. (2003) demonstrated that the minimal functional unit of Toc159 is constituted by the M-domain, of which overexpression could partially rescue the albino phenotype of the atToc159 knockout mutant of A. thaliana (i.e., ppi2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Despite its importance, the study of the M-domain is still in its infancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Whilst most of the current knowledge of chloroplast protein import is based on the observations in P. sativum and A. thaliana, we have recently identified homologs of Toc receptors from the single-cell C4 species, Bienertia sinuspersici (Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This species from the family Chenopodeaceae is of particular interest due to its novel mechanism of C4 photosynthesis through subcellular compartmentation of organelles and enzymes within single chlorenchyma cells (Akhani et al., 2005; Chuong et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The differential partitioning of nucleus-encoded enzymes between dimorphic chloroplasts implicates the existence of multiple sorting pathways, which could be mediated by the preferential assembly of distinct substrate-specific Toc complexes at distinct subcellular locations (Offermann et al., 2011; Lung et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that the B. sinuspersici genome encodes multiple isoforms of Toc159, which are targeted to the dimorphic chloroplasts by a novel C-terminal TP-like sorting signal (Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have extended our investigation into the elements of the BsToc159 C-terminus (CT) that are involved in chloroplast targeting and envelope association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We used a number of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs to differentiate the regions that are required for targeting from those that are important for anchoring the receptor to the chloroplast outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>EGFP fusion proteins with the equivalent regions of the A. thaliana homologs and swapping experiments revealed some variation in plastid-associated signals of Toc159 CTs from different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data extend the understanding of the chloroplast targeting information contained within the CT region of Toc159, and reinforce the role it may play in controlling differential subcellular localization to the dimorphic chloroplasts in B. sinuspersici. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Our previous bioinformatics analyses predicted that the CT of BsToc159 shares similar physicochemical and structural properties with chloroplast TPs (Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a putative TP-like chloroplast-sorting signal of 51 amino acids together with a putative stromal processing peptidase cleavage site was identified using the neural network-based ChloroP predictor (Emanuelsson et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, our previous EGFP-fusion experiments were based on the ChloroP-predicted TP-like region at the CT of BsToc159 plus five additional residues, which successfully directed the reversible association of the passenger proteins with the outer envelope of chloroplasts (Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>It is a common practice to include some residues from the mature protein downstream of the predicted TP cleavage site when studying targeting of typical chloroplast preproteins (e.g., Lee et al., 2003, 2006, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>While the exact number of residues that should be included is not known, the original decision to include 5 additional residues beyond the predicted 51-amino acid TP-like chloroplast sorting signal of BsToc159 (Lung and Chuong, 2012) was based on other studies where approximately 5 amino acids were included (e.g., Ivanova et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004; Inoue et al., 2010; Okawa et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we sought to further elucidate the functional region of the novel TP-like sorting signal used by BsToc159 and identify the essential region which mediates the successful integration of the receptor into the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>First, we produced a number of transient expression constructs by fusing various lengths of BsToc159 CT ranging from 50 to 100 residues (i.e., C50 to C100) to the CT of EGFP (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficiency of the variable lengths of BsToc159 CT as a plastid-sorting signal, the EGFP-fusion constructs were subjected to colocalization studies in onion epidermal cells, which were co-transformed with a DsRed2 construct fused with the ferredoxin TP to direct it to plastids (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, although we previously showed that the 56 most C-terminal residues (i.e., the C56 construct) could direct ca. 60% of EGFP signal to the chloroplast envelope using A. thaliana mesophyll protoplasts (Lung and Chuong, 2012), the diffuse fluorescent signals of C50, C56 and C60 fusion proteins indicated a cytoplasmic localization in onion epidermal cells (Figures 2A–C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Thus, the contrasting subcellular localization patterns of the C56 construct in the two cell types implicated some species-specific preferential targeting of the BsToc159 CT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>When the BsToc159 CT was extended to include additional upstream residues (i.e., C70, C80 and C90), the fusion proteins appeared as punctate fluorescent spots, some of which were colocalized with the DsRed2-decorated plastids (Figures 2D–F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The non-plastid punctate structures that did not colocalize with the DsRed signals appeared irregular in size and shape most likely representing insoluble aggregates due to protein misfolding (Figures 2D–F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>However, a general trend was apparent in that the proportion of plastid-localized EGFP signal increased with the length of the BsToc159 CT fusion from C70 to C90 (Figures 2D–F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>As the length increased to C100, the vast majority of the EGFP signals colocalized with the DsRed2-decorated plastids as is evident from the merge of the two channels producing yellow punctate signals and the diagonal scattering pattern of pixels from both channels in a scatter plot (Figure 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, the C100 fusion proteins also labeled tubular protrusions extending from the DsRed2-decorated plastids, reminiscent of stroma-filled extensions called stromules (Figure 2G inset; Köhler and Hanson, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, deletion of the C-terminal 56 residues of BsToc159 from the C100 construct completely abolished plastid-targeting, leading to diffuse EGFP signals, further confirming that this region contains key plastid-targeting information (Figure 2H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Quantitatively, the Pearson's correlation coefficients and the Manders' coefficients (Manders et al., 1993) confirmed that the C100 fusion protein was among the best colocalized with the plastids (Figures 2I,J). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The transfected protoplasts were observed using fluorescence microscopy and the EGFP signals were also densitometrically measured following immunoblot analysis of transfected protoplasts fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Under the microscope, the C50 fusion proteins were predominantly observed as diffuse signals with approximately a quarter of the signal detected in the chloroplast membrane-associated fraction (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Increasing the length of the BsToc159 CT by 6 residues (i.e., C56) effectively directed 60% of EGFP protein to the chloroplast surface, resulting in the ring-like appearance of fluorescent signals surrounding the chloroplasts (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Further increase of the BsToc159 CT by 4 residues (i.e., C60) did not alter the subcellular distribution of EGFP signals qualitatively or quantitatively as compared to the C56 construct, suggesting that the required targeting information of the CT is contained within the C-terminal 56 residues of BsToc159 (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The presence of a strong signal in the soluble fraction for the C56 and C60 constructs could be attributed to the absence of a chloroplast membrane anchor, rendering their association with the chloroplast envelope transient/reversible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the elevated levels of these constructs in the soluble fraction could be due to overexpression and therefore slow targeting of the proteins to the chloroplasts leading to cytosolic accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This observation is in agreement with our previous findings that the envelope-associated C56 fusion proteins were susceptible to alkaline extraction, and that the addition of the Toc34 G-domain to the fusion protein effectively boosted the chloroplast membrane-associated signals to over 80% (Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Similar to our observations in onion epidermal cells, the C70, C80 and C90 constructs produced irregular punctate aggregates in addition to the ring-like signals encircling the chloroplasts (Figures 3D–F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Among the three constructs, the fluorescent signals at the chloroplast exterior were most prominent with C90 (Figure 3F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The fluorescent signals of the C100 construct were exclusively localized to the chloroplast envelope, whereas removal of the predicted chloroplast-targeting signal (i.e., C100Δ56) from this construct completely abolished chloroplast targeting, as expected (Figures 3G,H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The significantly higher abundance of chloroplast membrane-associated C100 signals compared to that of the C56 could be attributed to the presence of a membrane-anchoring region stabilizing the association between the C100 fusion proteins and the chloroplast envelope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In fact, alkaline extraction of the chloroplasts isolated from transfected protoplasts prior to immunoblot analysis revealed a drastic difference in the relative resistance of the C56 (i.e., 20%) as compared to the C100 (i.e., 80%) fusion protein (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we believe that the essential and sufficient chloroplast-sorting information for BsToc159 is embedded within the C-terminal 56 residues, whereas the immediate upstream sequence is important for anchoring the protein to the chloroplast surface, potentially by an as yet undetermined membrane-associating structure(s), which may not be complete or folded properly in the truncation constructs C70, C80 and C90, leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates (Figures 2D–F, 3D–F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>First, to gain insight into its structural organization, the amino acid sequence of BsToc159 was analyzed using IUPRed (Dosztanyi et al., 2005) and FoldIndex (Prilusky et al., 2005) to predict intrinsically disordered and structured regions (Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly with the use of a neural network predictor for protein secondary structures by the PSIPRED algorithm, we further divided the M-domain of BsToc159 into three subdomains designated as M1, M2 and M3 (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal region of the M-domain is linked to the central G-domain via a 150-residue M1 region, which is moderately unstructured except for a putative α-helical motif arranged in a predicted coiled-coil structure (Figures 5A,B), whereas the C-terminal 56-residue region containing the chloroplast targeting signal, designated as M3, contains a predicted amphipathic α-helix, which is also a structural feature of TPs (Figures 5A,B; Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The core region of the M-domain, designated as the M2 subdomain, is predicted to be a β-strand-rich region (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Since the resistance of the C100 fusion protein to alkaline extraction also implied that some structural features within part of this subdomain might be involved in chloroplast outer membrane association (Figure 4), we asked if the M2 subdomain had a tendency to fold into a β-barrel, which is a common conformation comprised of multiple amphipathic β-strands that span the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria and endosymbiotic organelles (Walther et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with sequence-based structure (PSIPred) and disorder predictions implicating an α-helical segment within subdomain M1, a smaller segment in the middle of M2, and another large predicted α-helix near the CT of M3 (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Our recent discovery of the chloroplast-targeting information embedded within the BsToc159 CT using sequence-based bioinformatics predictions (Lung and Chuong, 2012) raises a number of fundamental questions about the nature of this novel sorting signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="?"><plain>For instance, what is the length of the signal that is essential for chloroplast sorting? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="?"><plain>Is there a membrane-integration element associated with the signal that is responsible for anchoring the receptor to the chloroplast envelope? </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have addressed these questions using transiently-expressed fluorescent proteins fused to variable-length truncation and domain-swapped constructs, and have complemented this approach with structural analyses of the M-domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data point to a novel class of sorting signals present in the Toc159 family of chloroplast protein import receptors for targeting to the chloroplast outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>According to the Plant Proteome Database, approximately 47 different proteins are annotated to reside on the chloroplast outer membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kinoue/OM.htm">http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kinoue/OM.htm</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu">http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu</ext-link>; Inoue, 2007; Sun et al., 2009; Breuers et al., 2011; Inoue, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms for targeting of these outer envelope proteins (OEPs) have not been completely elucidated, multiple pathways are apparent and, in many cases, the membrane-spanning domains constitute the protein sorting information (for reviews, see Hofmann and Theg, 2005; Bölter and Soll, 2011; Lee et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>With the exception of Toc75, which relies on an N-terminal TP for chloroplast targeting (Tranel et al., 1995), the other identified integral β-barrel proteins, including OEP21, OEP24 and OEP37, appear to self-insert into the chloroplast outer membrane (Pohlmeyer et al., 1998; Bölter et al., 1999; Goetze et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The majority of α-helical OEPs commonly contain a single hydrophobic α-helix which functions as a transmembrane anchor as well as a sorting signal (Hofmann and Theg, 2005; Bölter and Soll, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Depending on whether the transmembrane domain is located at the N- or CT, these OEPs are broadly classified into the families of signal-anchored proteins (e.g., OEP7, OEP14, HKI, Toc64, CHUP1) (Li et al., 1991; Wiese et al., 1999; Sohrt and Soll, 2000; Lee et al., 2001; Oikawa et al., 2008) and tail-anchored proteins (e.g., OMP24, HPL, Toc34, OEP9) (Fischer et al., 1994; Chen and Schnell, 1997; Froehlich et al., 2001; Dhanoa et al., 2010), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Although it had been originally proposed that these proteins are spontaneously integrated into the destination membrane without any energy requirement or proteinaceous factor (Schleiff and Klösgen, 2001), Bae et al. (2008) discovered a chaperone-like ankyrin repeat protein (i.e., AKR2A) in Arabidopsis which binds to the transmembrane domains and the CT regions of tail-anchored proteins, and thereby functions as a cytosolic mediator for their specific sorting to the chloroplast envelope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>To meet the criteria of tail-anchored proteins, a protein must exhibit three structural features: (i) the exposure of the majority of the protein to the cytosolic side; (ii) the presence of a single transmembrane domain at or near the CT, and; (iii) the protrusion of a short CT tail into the organelle interior (Kutay et al., 1993; Abell and Mullen, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that Toc159 shares some structural resemblance to a tail-anchored protein and its GTPase homolog, Toc34, is a tail-anchored protein (Dhanoa et al., 2010), our studies revealed some important differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>First, we showed that the BsToc159 CT contains some chloroplast-sorting information, but this region does not appear to constitute a hydrophobic transmembrane α-helix (Lung and Chuong, 2012), as demonstrated by the susceptibility of BsToc159-C56 fusion proteins to alkaline extraction (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified a discrete region within the 60–100 residues from the CT of BsToc159 that constitutes a membrane association domain, as demonstrated by the resistance of BsToc159-C100 proteins to alkaline extraction (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Contrary to that of tail-anchored proteins, this membrane-associating region does not contain an insertion signal for the outer membrane of the plastid envelope since the C-terminally truncated construct (i.e., BsToc159-C100Δ56) produced cytosolic localization of the EGFP proteins (Figures 2H, 3H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Previous truncation studies indicated that the hydrophilic CT immediately flanking the transmembrane domain of a tail-anchored protein constitutes part of the sorting information but the CT tail itself could not direct fusion proteins to the chloroplast envelope (Lee et al., 2001, 2004; Dhanoa et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the 56 residues of BsToc159 CT make up a hydrophilic tail, which could mediate the targeting of ca. 60% of EGFP to the chloroplast surface independently of the putative membrane anchor (Figure 3B; Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>While the ChloroP predictor suggested a 51-residue length of the TP-like sorting signal at the CT end of BsToc159 (Lung and Chuong, 2012), we observed that BsToc159-C56 outperformed BsToc159-C50 in the targeting of EGFP to the chloroplast envelope of Arabidopsis protoplasts (Figures 3A,B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The higher efficiency of targeting by the C56 construct could indicate that a longer sorting signal is required in the non-native context of a protein fusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Similarly, it has been shown that a TP length of more than ca. 60 amino acids is required for efficient translocation of a passenger protein into chloroplasts (Bionda et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined if the BsToc159 CT and typical chloroplast TPs employ similar targeting and translocation machineries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Previously, the TPs of 208 plastid proteins were grouped into seven subgroups with distinct sequence motifs by hierarchical clustering (Lee et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The publicly available algorithm produced by Lee et al. (2008) did not identify any of the consensus motifs from the BsToc159 sequence (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The critical chloroplast-sorting motifs of the BsToc159 CT may be unraveled by the equivalent alanine substitution approach used by Lee et al. (2008) in the future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have multiple lines of evidence to support the notion that Toc159 is not a tail-anchored protein but is targeted to the chloroplast surface via a novel pathway under the guidance of a non-canonical sorting signal at the CT. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In addition to shedding light on the nature of a novel chloroplast-sorting signal within the BsToc159 CT, the present study has provided the first insight into a long-standing question regarding how the Toc159 receptor is associated with the chloroplast outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>At the time of its discovery, independent researchers consistently observed a 52-kDa protease-protected product of Toc159 (formerly known as OEP86) in pea and Arabidopsis after “shaving” the cytosolically exposed proteins/protein domains from the surface of isolated chloroplasts by treatment with thermolysin, an outer membrane-impermeable protease (Waegemann et al., 1992; Hirsch et al., 1994; Kessler et al., 1994; Bölter et al., 1998; Bauer et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The M-domain has been defined based on this biochemical evidence, but it has never been clear how, exactly, the entire C-terminal 52-kDa portion of Toc159 is associated with the chloroplast envelope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>While no study has yet addressed this issue, it is of our particular interest to examine the nature of the membrane-anchor of Toc159. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Proteins traversing the envelope membranes of endosymbiotic organelles are structurally classified into two groups: α-helical transmembrane proteins and β-barrel proteins (Lee et al., 2013, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Previous hydrophilicity analyses ruled out the possibility of Toc159 belonging to the former family due to the absence of a transmembrane α-helix (Kessler et al., 1994; Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Although secondary structure prediction using the M-domain sequence of BsToc159 as query identified 16 consecutive β-strands in the central region (designated as the “M2 region” in this study; Figure 5B), they are too short (2–8 residues per strand; mean = 5.1 residue per strand) to represent the membrane-spanning regions (6–25 residues per strand) of a β-barrel protein (Taylor et al., 2006), which is in agreement with the negative result from the PROFtmb β-barrel predictor program (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Based on sequence analyses, we believe that the CTs of the Toc159 isoforms form a non-canonical anchor to the chloroplast outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The high homology of the central region of the AtToc159 M-domain (the M2 region) with the lipid-binding domain of LpxD, a left-handed β-helical protein, is consistent with our secondary structure prediction suggesting the presence of a short β-strand-rich region in the M-domain of Toc159, and also fosters the idea that Toc159 is anchored to the chloroplast outer membrane in a non-α-helical and non-β-barrel-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ratio of mean ellipticity at 208 nm and 220 nm of recombinant AtToc159 M-domain suggests the presence of associated forms of the protein (Hoang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The associations could be intramolecular interactions such as those that occur in the coiled-coil or β-coil structures, and/or intermolecular interactions between M-domain monomers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The precise nature of the associations cannot be elucidated from the current circular dichroism data; but the presence of associated forms is consistent with the predicted secondary structure elements of the M-domain (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>In the absence of additional structural data, it is premature to conclude that Toc159 adopts a lipophilic β-helix for associating with the chloroplast outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>However, multiple lines of evidence support the notion that the M2 region of Toc159 constitutes a non-canonical membrane anchor: (i) a portion of the M2 sequence was sufficient to confer resistance of BsToc159-C100, but not BsToc159-C56, to alkaline extraction (Figure 4); (ii) the 180 residues from the CT end of PsToc159 also anchored a fusion protein to the chloroplast envelope with resistance to alkaline extraction (Muckel and Soll, 1996); (iii) truncation of BsToc159-C100 in blocks of 10 residues (i.e., C90, C80 and C70) progressively abolished the plastid-associated signals of EGFP fusion proteins (Figure 2); and (iv) the formation of irregular punctate structures of BsToc159-C70, C80 and C90 signals could be attributed to the disruption of an ordered structure essential for chloroplast association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In the future, a more in-depth structural analysis of the Toc159 M-domain will provide additional information about the nature of the unconventional membrane anchor, which will lead to insights into the function and mechanism of action of the Toc159 receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>For instance, a number of reports have documented the partitioning of Toc159 between the cytosol and the chloroplast envelope, which suggests the possibility that Toc159 is a cycling receptor for preprotein recognition (Hiltbrunner et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2002; Lung and Chuong, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Thus, an unconventional membrane anchor (e.g., β-helix), in contrast with a transmembrane α-helix or a β-barrel, may account for the reversible association of Toc159 with the chloroplast outer membrane in support of the “cycling” hypothesis for Toc159-facilitated targeting of chloroplast preproteins (Hiltbrunner et al., 2001; Ivanova et al., 2004; Smith, 2006). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Our discovery of a novel sorting signal at the Toc159 CT raised another interesting question regarding factors that interact with the sorting signal to mediate the specific targeting of Toc159 to the chloroplast envelope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that the TP-like sorting signal at the CT of BsToc159 (i.e., BsToc159-C56) could guide EGFP to chloroplasts of A. thaliana mesophyll protoplasts (Figure 3B) but not to plastids of onion epidermal cells (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Similarly, it has been shown that some TPs guided protein import preferentially into one plastid type over others (Wan et al., 1996; Yan et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Elkehal et al. (2012) demonstrated that the different composition of lipids in chloroplast membranes could influence the Toc-mediated binding and import of preproteins into outer envelope vesicles, and more recently, Kim et al. (2014) have shown that lipids of the outer membrane serve as the receptor for AKR2A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In addition to the effect on protein import, the lipids are known to be determinants of the topology, folding and integration of membrane proteins (Schleiff et al., 2001; Dowhan and Bogdanov, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference has been found in the glycerolipid composition of envelope membranes from chloroplasts and non-green plastids (Douce and Joyard, 1979), and it has been shown previously that the lipid composition of plastids does not change during the greening of wheat leaves (Bahl et al., 1976). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesize that the distinctive subcellular localization patterns of BsToc159-C56 proteins in onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts is not likely attributed to the lipid composition of the plastid envelope membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it could also be explained by the possibility that the species-specific properties of the Bienertia CT may contribute to this differential subcellular localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Any negative correlation between the targeting efficiency of BsToc159-C56 to protoeoliposomes and their lipid compositions would reinforce the idea that some unknown proteinaceous factors interact with the sorting signal of Toc159 and mediate a specific subcellular sorting pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Due to the resemblance of the CT sorting signal of Toc159 to a typical chloroplast preprotein TP (Lung and Chuong, 2012), it is plausible that the Toc machinery plays a similar role in the recognition of Toc159 CTs at the chloroplast surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>In fact, Wallas et al. (2003) reported that both binding and insertion of AtToc159 proteins into proteoliposomes required Toc34 and Toc75. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the fact that different Toc complexes are assembled in green and non-green cell types with dissimilar substrate specificities (Bauer et al., 2000; Ivanova et al., 2004; Kubis et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004; Dutta et al., 2014) is consistent with our observation of differential targeting of BsToc159-C56 proteins to etioplasts and chloroplasts (Figures 2B, 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Toc machinery at the chloroplast surface, the general import pathway of chloroplast preproteins involves chaperones, co-chaperones and other cytosolic factors (for review, see Lee et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Although tail-anchored membrane proteins could be sorted efficiently to the chloroplast envelope with high fidelity in the absence of any cytosolic factor, the efficiency was higher with the supplementation of complete cytosol, Hsp70 or Hsp90 (Kriechbaumer and Abell, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been demonstrated that AKR2A functions as a cytosolic mediator for targeting of outer envelope membrane proteins such as OEP7, Toc34, and OEP9 to the chloroplast (Bae et al., 2008; Dhanoa et al., 2010; Richardson et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Although a number of other cytosolic receptors and chaperones for the targeting of chloroplast outer envelope proteins have also been identified (for review, see Lee et al., 2013), no cytosolic factors that specifically interact with the sorting signal of Toc159 have yet been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Given the observation that the CT sequences of Toc159 isoforms from B. sinuspersici outperformed that of A. thaliana in the sorting of fusion proteins to the plastid envelope (Figures 6, 7), a thorough interactome study of the Toc159 CT would not only reveal additional details about the chloroplast-sorting pathway of Toc159 but also further our understanding of the mechanism of selective protein import into dimorphic chloroplasts in the single-cell C4 system. </plain></SENT>
