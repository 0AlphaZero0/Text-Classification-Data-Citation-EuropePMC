The condition is characterized by gradual loss of vision, color vision defects, and temporal optic pallor. To understand the molecular mechanism by which <italic>OPA1</italic> mutations cause optic atrophy and to facilitate the development of an effective therapeutic agent for optic atrophies, we analyzed phenotypes in the developing and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes produced by mutant <italic>dOpa1</italic> (<italic>CG8479</italic>), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human <italic>OPA1</italic>. Heterozygous mutation of <italic>dOpa1</italic> by a P-element or transposon insertions causes no discernable eye phenotype, whereas the homozygous mutation results in embryonic lethality. Using powerful <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic techniques, we created eye-specific somatic clones. The somatic homozygous mutation of <italic>dOpa1</italic> in the eyes caused rough (mispatterning) and glossy (decreased lens and pigment deposition) eye phenotypes in adult flies; this phenotype was reversible by precise excision of the inserted P-element. Furthermore, we show the rough eye phenotype is caused by the loss of hexagonal lattice cells in developing eyes, suggesting an increase in lattice cell apoptosis. In adult flies, the <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutation caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as mitochondrial fragmentation associated with loss and damage of the cone and pigment cells. We show that superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), Vitamin E, and genetically overexpressed human SOD1 (hSOD1) is able to reverse the glossy eye phenotype of <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutant large clones, further suggesting that ROS play an important role in cone and pigment cell death. Our results show <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutations cause cell loss by two distinct pathogenic pathways. This study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of optic atrophy and demonstrates the promise of antioxidants as therapeutic agents for this condition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Optic atrophies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a gradual loss of vision, color vision defects, and temporal optic pallor.

OPA1 consists of an N-terminal mitochondrial target signal, a transmembrane domain, a presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease recognition site, and a dynamin-like domain with GTP binding activity. OPA1 is expressed ubiquitously [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and functions in mitochondrial fusion [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], ATP production [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and cytochrome-c mediated apoptosis [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Mitochondrial diseases are associated with mitochondrial fragmentation due to the fast proteolytic processing of the OPA1 protein. Overexpression of OPA1 can prevent such fragmentation [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These observations suggest that OPA1 plays an important role in mitochondrial function.</p><p>Although studies have contributed to our current understanding of OPA1 in terms of function and its relationship to optic atrophy, the pathogenesis of optic atrophy remains poorly understood. The major goal of this study is to establish an animal model for effective <italic>in vivo</italic> OPA1 studies for pathogenesis and therapeutic development. Previous attempts to create a mouse model of <italic>OPA1</italic> revealed that homozygous <italic>Opa1</italic> mutant mice are embryonically lethal, while heterozygous animals showed no phenotype until a later age [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of optic atrophy would offer several advantages: there is excellent homology between <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes and many human disease loci; it has a short lifespan; its eye development is well-studied; its genome has been sequenced; a wide variety of mutants and gene manipulation systems are available; and, for optic atrophy studies, its eye structure is well-defined and the phenotype is easily visualized [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development, lattice cell apoptosis is highly regulated, with one-third of the lattice cells being eliminated by apoptosis.</p><p>Here, we established a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model where the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>OPA1</italic>, <italic>CG8479</italic> (<italic>dOpa1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] is inactivated by two different insertions.

<italic>Drosophila Opa1</italic> Is an Ortholog of Human <italic>OPA1</italic>
</title><p>To identify the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of human <italic>OPA1</italic>, we performed BLAST searches with the human <italic>OPA1</italic> cDNA and amino acid sequences. <italic>CG8479</italic> (GenBank [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>], protein accession number: AAF58275) was identified as a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>hOPA1</italic> (E = 0.0). To further characterize <italic>dOpa1</italic>, we used multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE) algorithm to perform amino acid sequence alignments of human OPA1 (hOPA1), mouse Opa1 (mOpa1), CG8479 (dOPA1), and Yeast Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040006-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In all four organisms, the GTPase domain was the most conserved region and the basic domain was the least conserved region. The amino acid sequence of mOPA1 shared 96% similarity with hOPA1. When regions of these proteins were compared, the similarity percentages were 86.5% for the basic domain, 99.6% for the GTPase domain, and 98% for the dynamin central region. dOpa1 shared 51.2% similarity to hOpa1 amino acid sequence, a higher score than the well-studied yeast protein Mgm1. At the domain level, the similarity scores were 24.5% for the basic domain, 72% for the GTPase domain, and 53.5% for the dynamin central region. The high amino acid conservation of the GTPase domain and the dynamin regions between hOPA1 and dOpa1 suggests that dOpa1 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of hOPA1.</p><p>Three <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines with P-element/transposon insertions in the <italic>dOpa1</italic> gene were used in this study.

It is very interesting that mutation of <italic>OPA1</italic> in humans causes an autosomal dominant condition. When analyzing eye phenotype of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> heterozygous for mutations in <italic>dOPA1</italic> did not appear to have a gross phenotype. There are many possible explanations for this observation, some of which include the evolutionary differences between <italic>OPA1</italic> in humans and its orthologs. However<italic>,</italic> the grossly normal eye structure in heterozygous mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not imply normal function. It is still possible that the eyes are dysfunctional even though the eye structure is unaffected. We are in the process to analyze the heterozygous mutants for cardiac, skeletal muscle and photoreceptor function.</p><p>In the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, the imaginal disc undergoes two phases of proliferation. First, all cells divide rapidly and asynchronously without regulation [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Then, the morphogenic furrow sweeps across the eye disc to pattern the cells. Subsequently, the cells differentiate into photoreceptor cells or undergo another round of division, which produces cone and pigment cells. During this process, the photoreceptor cells are specified first, they then retract and recruit four cone cells, which in turn recruit two pigment cells [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The cells remaining from the first phase of proliferation form ommatidial lattice cells [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These include the secondary, tertiary, and bristle cells that separate adjacent ommatidia, forming the precise hexagonal patterns of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. After cell expansion, excess cells are eliminated by apoptosis [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results show that the rough/glossy-eye phenotype of the <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutants is associated with lattice and cone/pigment cell death, and that death of lattice cells and cone/pigment cells occur at different developmental stages. In developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, the loss of <italic>dOpa1</italic> causes a significant reduction in the number of lattice cells. However, the cone and pigment cells are structurally normal at 42 h APF stage, but later damage or death of cone and pigment cells results in decrease secretion of lens materials.</p><p>The underlying mechanism causing increased lattice cell death due to dOpa1 loss is still unknown. Previous studies showed that lattice cells respond to signals from cone and pigment cells [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results show that loss of <italic>dOpa1</italic> causes a significant reduction in the number of lattice cells in the presence of normal cone and pigment cells, indicating that death of lattice cells is not due to early defects in differentiation of retinal cell types. It has been shown that OPA1 reduces mitochondrial cytochrome-c release following cristae remodeling in the presence of activators of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, electron microscopy and electron tomography studies suggest that OPA1 sequesters cytochrome-c within mitochondrial cristae by narrowing cristae junctions, thereby inhibiting the redistribution of cytochrome-c to the inner membrane space [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the role of cytochrome-c in apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only been recently established. Mendes and colleagues showed that <italic>cyt c-d</italic> plays an important role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye apoptosis; and mutation of <italic>cyt c-d</italic> causes an increase in the number of interommatidial cells and perimeter cells [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus we hypothesize that lattice cell death is the result of a cell autonomous death signal from mitochondria.</p><p>Our results show that cone and pigment cell death was correlated with increased ROS levels and mitochondrial fragmentation. This implies that the increased ROS production induces cell death, which is further supported by the reversal of these effects and the rescuing of the glossy eye phenotype by antioxidants. Increased ROS production can trigger apoptosis to eliminate deleterious cells [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but the exact link between oxidative stress and specific apoptosis pathways remains elusive. Transient fluctuations in ROS levels may serve as an important regulator of mitochondrial respiration, but high and sustained ROS levels cause severe damage [<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgen-0040006-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The rough/glossy phenotype is a result of the lack of cone and pigment cells. The consequence is insufficient secretion of lens material, which directly contributes to the glossy phenotype. This phenotype may occur because cone and pigment precursor cells undergo too few mitotic divisions, failing to enter the second mitotic wave due to insufficient ATP production. Alternatively, the phenotype could result from the misregulation of cone and or pigment cell differentiation. Our results suggest an additional possibility of cell damage and death from ROS after 42h APF. Importantly, antioxidants can partially rescue the glossy eye phenotype in the <italic>dOpa1</italic> intron 3 large clone ommatidia, but do not rescue the rough eye phenotype. This may further implicate the role of ROS in the pathogenesis of the eye phenotypes in the <italic>dOpa1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Our results show that loss of <italic>dOpa1</italic> causes a rough, glossy eye phenotype by two distinct pathogenic pathways. The lattice cell death observed in the developing eye is probably linked to increased cytochrome-c release. The glossy eye phenotype in the mutant flies is consistent with decreased lens material secretion from the cone/pigment cells, which are damaged by sustained high ROS levels. Since we were able to partially reverse the eye phenotype through antioxidant treatment and expression of human SOD, antioxidant may provide a fruitful approach for treating this condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>
