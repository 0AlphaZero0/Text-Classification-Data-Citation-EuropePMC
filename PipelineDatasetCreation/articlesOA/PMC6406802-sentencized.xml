<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Shoulder complaints are a common musculoskeletal disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The one-year prevalence of shoulder pain in the general population ranges from 5% to 47%, while the lifetime prevalence has been estimated up to 67% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Work-related physical and psychosocial factors may be associated with onset and/or worsening of shoulder pain within the working-age population [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Among shoulder complaints, subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS) is the most common disorder that result in loss of function, increased pain sensitivity [3], and impaired quality of life, accounting for up to 70% of consultations in primary care [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SAPS is characterized by persistent pain around the acromion, which usually worsens during or after lifting the upper extremity [5], and embraces clinical diagnosis such as subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of SAPS remains unclear, and previous evidence suggests that 50% of adults with chronic SAPS may only recover after 10 to 18 months of initial onset [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This leads to a considerable economic burden [8], due to absenteeism from work, productivity loss, and high expenditure for health care services [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A great diversity of conservative interventions, combining pharmacological and physical therapy treatments, is often used to decrease pain and enhance function in SAPS [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There exists; however, very limited evidence about the effectiveness of existing treatments to improve the functional limitations associated with this condition [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Amongst them, exercise therapy has been suggested as the core conservative treatment [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the use of deep dry needling has shown to relieve shoulder pain [12], and ultrasound-guided injection therapy is widely used before surgery, with good outcomes in the short-term [13,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention is mainly indicated when pain and functional limitations persist after conservative measures, and for patients with clearly distinguished clinical signs [11,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Indeed, there is conflicting evidence about the efficacy of surgery compared to conservative approaches [16,17], or no treatment [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Despite that, the frequency of acromioplasty has dramatically increased in the last decades [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>There is; however, scarce evidence about the most-appropriate post-operative intervention for SAPS, with exercise therapy showing good results [20,21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Interferential therapy (IFT) is a highly popular treatment modality in the clinical setting, which involves crossing two medium frequency currents to generate a low-frequency beating effect in the deep tissues [22], and can be used alone or combined with massage [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although IFT is purported to provide pain relief and increased blood flow to the tissues [24], there is still inadequate evidence to support its use as a sole intervention for pain management in musculoskeletal disorders in general [22], and in shoulder pain in particular [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, IFT as a supplement to other interventions has demonstrated advantages over placebo and control treatments for reducing musculoskeletal pain [27], although there are conflicting findings on this issue [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Current research also highlights the need for high quality clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of multimodal approaches for SAPS [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to investigate the effects of adding IFT electro-massage to a two-week usual care protocol, compared with the usual care protocol alone, on pain intensity, upper limb functionality, and shoulder passive range of motion in adults with SAPS who underwent acromioplasty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that adding IFT electro-massage to the usual care intervention would achieve higher effectiveness than the sole use of the usual care regime. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A single-blinded (the evaluator assessing the outcome measures remained blinded to the participants’ allocation group) randomized controlled trial was carried out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and checklist were followed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The research protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki statement of ethical, legal, and regulatory principals to provide guidance for health-related research involving human subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The study was approved by the Ethical Research Committee of the Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, Sevilla, Spain (project code CEI 2012PI/172, approval date: September 26th 2012), and prospectively registered (Clinical Trials.gov, Identifier NCT03338283). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Participants </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with shoulder pain, who underwent acromioplasty in the 12 weeks before data collection, were referred by an orthopedic surgeon at a large public hospital in Southern Spain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, SAPS was diagnosed following a positive response to clinical examination (Hawkins–Kennedy test, drop-arm test, external rotation lag sign, and empty can test) and radiologic diagnostic criteria to differentiate SAPS from other conditions (e.g., bone or joint abnormalities) [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>A detailed description of the clinical tests can be found elsewhere [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>For the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination, a negative response to the Hawkins–Kennedy test appears to rule out SAPS (pooled sensitivity and specificity, 79% and 59%, respectively) [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The drop-arm test or the external rotation lag sign (specificity, 90–97%) are likely to rule in SAPS when positive [30], and the empty can test is a reliable and helpful tool to confirm subacromial impingement syndrome (87% specificity) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Overall, the combination of imaging features and clinical tests can help to confirm the presence of SAPS [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Acromioplasty was considered a feasible intervention for patients between 20 and 80 years, with anterior shoulder pain lasting more than three months [34], and who received previous conservative treatment (manual therapy, pharmacological treatment, and use of corticosteroid injections) with no satisfactory results [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Those participants with a self-reported pain intensity ≥30mm in the visual analogue scale (VAS), and a score &lt;45 points on the personal psychological apprehension scale (PPAS) [36], were invited to participate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The PPAS is a valid, reliable, and simple-to-handle tool to assess the subjects’ apprehension to receive electrical stimulation therapy [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The exclusion criteria were as follows: Any contraindication to the use of IFT (Table 1) [38,39]; previous cervical spine or shoulder surgery; a history of neurological or mental illnesses; diagnosed central or peripheral nervous system diseases [23]; concomitant fracture in the neck/shoulder; altered sensitivity to tactile stimuli or loss of sensation in the neck/shoulder or upper extremity [6]; concomitant radiological diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral or acromioclavicular joints; fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis [23]; having received injections of corticoids or hyaluronic acid following surgery; symptoms of frozen shoulder [40]; impaired cognition or communication; and being involved in an on-going medico-legal dispute. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>An external website (http://www.randomization.com) was used to complete the randomization schedule for treatment order, considering a 1:1 ratio distribution of participants in the study groups (IFT electro-massage and control group). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>An external assistant safeguarded the randomization sequence and prepared sealed opaque envelopes concealing the treatment order allocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Following baseline allocation, demographic and clinical data were initially collected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>A blinded evaluator collected all measurements at baseline and immediately after the last treatment session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The treatment protocol consisted of a two-week intervention regime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Three treatment sessions, each lasting around 70–85 min, were made per week and supervised by a physiotherapist with more than 15 years of clinical experience. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Outcome Measures </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Participants were asked to rate their worst shoulder pain intensity during the last 24 h using a 100-mm VAS, with 0 denoting “no pain” and 100 denoting “extreme and unbearable pain” [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Minimal clinically-important differences for the VAS are based on a 15–20% change [42], or a decrease above 14 mm [43], following intervention. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The upper limb functionality was evaluated using the Constant-Murley score, which consists of a 100-point scale, with final values representing different functional levels: excellent (&gt;80), good (65–79), medium (50–64), and bad (&lt;50) [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The minimal detectable change for the Constant-Murley score has been set at 17 points for individuals with subacromial impingement syndrome [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The Simple Goniometer iPhone® app (version 1.1, Ockendon.net, Oswestry, England) was used to assess the shoulder pain-free passive range of movement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>An iPhone® 3GS, iOS 4.3.5 (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) was fixed to the participants’ arm with an armband bracelet (Kalenji, Villeneuve d’Ascq, France). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The recordings of shoulder range of motion were made twice (2-min break between assessments), using the average value of the two measures for further analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Before assessments, participants were asked to stop the evaluator when they started to feel low-intensity pain during movement (below 20 mm in the VAS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>To evaluate shoulder flexion and extension, participants were seated with back support and no armrests, and the iPhone® was fixed on the lateral side of the arm (2 cm proximal to the glenohumeral joint). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>For shoulder abduction, participants kept the same position, and the iPhone® was placed on the ventral side of the arm (2 cm proximal to the glenohumeral joint). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Shoulder adduction was assessed with the participant lying supine, with 90 degrees of shoulder flexion (or the maximum possible pain-free flexion), and with the iPhone® placed on the ventral side of the arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Internal and external rotation were evaluated with participants in supine, with 90 degrees of shoulder abduction (or the maximum possible pain-free abduction), 90 degrees of elbow flexion, forearm in neutral position, and the iPhone® was placed in the ventral side of the arm (2 cm proximal to the glenohumeral joint). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>During all assessments, the evaluator applied gentle pressure to the arm or forearm until the edge of movement was reached [46], and maximum caution was taken to minimize the scapular motion by keeping the shoulder and back in contact with the back support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>A smartphone inclinometer or virtual goniometer is an easy-to-use, valid, and reliable tool, comparable to other clinical methods, to assess shoulder range of motion in healthy subjects and in individuals with shoulder disorders [46,47,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The Simple Goniometer iPhone® app has shown to be reliable and possesses concurrent validity [49]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Participants in the control group underwent an usual care protocol involving: Fifteen minutes of transcutaneous infrared thermotherapy (INFRA-2000, Enraf-Nonius BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) [50]; 35 min of active, self-assisted, and isometric exercise therapy [51,52]; 20 min of manual therapy to retrain scapulohumeral movement and to provide soft and pain-free shoulder traction [51]; and 5 min of pulsatile ultrasound (Sonopuls 490®, Enraf-Nonius BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) over the acromium and scapulohumeral area, with a 5 cm2 head, and using a frequency of 3 Mhz and a power of 1.2 w/cm2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>For participants in the IFT electro-massage group, a 15-min IFT electro-massage over the neck-shoulder and the glenohumeral joint was added in every treatment session to the usual care treatment previously described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>A bipolar application, using a carrier frequency of 4000 Hz at constant voltage and an amplitude-modulated frequency of 100 Hz, was administered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The current intensity was set at a medium-high level, but always adapted to individual tolerance, to achieve a “strong but comfortable tingling” without evoking visible muscle twitches [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Two rubber electrodes (6 × 8 cm) were fitted inside sponges of equal size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The sponges were dampened with hot water to avoid unpleasant sensations and to allow a normal sliding over the skin during the electro-massage [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Some needles with hot water were prepared to dampen the sponges during the procedure, if required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The physiotherapist wore vinyl gloves and moved the sponges over the neck, shoulder and scapular areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, the therapist performed slight traction of the glenohumeral joint, and stretching of the neck-shoulder muscles (e.g., upper trapezius and levator scapulae) while administering the IFT (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The present findings demonstrated that including IFT electro-massage in a two-week usual care protocol, combining manual therapy, exercises, thermotherapy, and ultrasound, achieved better immediate results on shoulder pain intensity, upper limb function, and pain-free passive range of movement (except for shoulder extension and adduction), compared with the sole use of the usual care regime, in adults with SAPS who underwent recent shoulder surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The decrease in shoulder pain intensity and the improvement in upper limb functionality was significantly higher, with a high effect size, for participants who received IFT electro-massage, although individuals in both groups reduced their shoulder pain after the two-week protocol above the minimum clinically important difference for the VAS [42,43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, changes in the Constant-Murley score surpassed the 17-point clinically relevant threshold [45] only for those in the IFT electro-massage group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The passive shoulder range of movement increased by 20–40% in the control group, and by 30–70% in the IFT electro-massage group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The differences between groups for shoulder pain-free passive mobility achieved a high effect size for shoulder flexion and internal rotation and a medium effect size for shoulder abduction and external rotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>To date, there has been a single previous study investigating the effects of IFT electro-massage [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This former trial used IFT as a sole intervention in individuals with chronic low-back pain and concluded greater improvements on pain, disability, and quality of life, compared to the use of superficial massage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>These positive effects were explained based on the purported capacity of IFT to stimulate cutaneous sensory nerves and evoke mild vasodilation [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study assessing the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention including IFT electro-massage in adults with post-operative shoulder pain after acromioplasty. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>There is a huge debate about the clinical impact of including IFT and other electrotherapeutic modalities for the management of chronic shoulder pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Conflicting to the current results, the addition of IFT to exercise and/or manual therapy did not demonstrate greater clinical effects on shoulder pain and disability, compared to the use of exercise and/or manual therapy alone, in individuals with non-specific soft-tissue shoulder disorders [53], or with unilateral shoulder impingement syndrome [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Nazligul et al. [28] recently concluded that IFT does not provide additional effect to a multimodal approach including cryotherapy, exercise, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with SAPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that the combination of IFT with shoulder exercises [55], ultrasound, thermotherapy, and stretching [56] is effective in the management of frozen shoulders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the use of IFT alone has shown to be clinically effective to relieve pain during movement and to increase pain-free passive shoulder mobility in hemiplegic shoulder pain [57] and, when combined with exercise therapy, seems to improve pain, function, and quality of life in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In the latter study, the effect of combining IFT with exercise therapy was; however, similar to that of including ultrasound or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation instead, in the intervention protocol [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Indeed, IFT seems to be a potential, although modest, effective supplement to other interventions to decrease pain, compared to control or placebo treatments, in musculoskeletal pain disorders [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>There are; however, many controversies on this issue [25,26], and the heterogeneity and methodological problems across studies make it difficult to reach conclusive statements. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>This inconclusive evidence about the impact of using IFT, alone or in addition to other conservative approaches, persists when considering other chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, such as neck or low-back pain [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>There are some plausible explanations to account for this issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>First, the carrier frequency of the IFT current differs among studies, and this may influence the hypoalgesic response after stimulation [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Second, the use of electrotherapy may evoke a long sustained placebo-induced pain relief effect [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In this sense, most of the previous studies investigating the role of IFT on shoulder pain have not included sham IFT as a control intervention [54,55,56,58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Third, the clinical context and the social connection between patient and therapist seem to modulate the effect of IFT [62,63], although these aspects have been scarcely controlled in the existing literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Finally, only one previous trial has evaluated the effects of IFT, compared to sham IFT, on post-operative pain, and range of motion in patients undergoing knee surgery [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Even though IFT showed positive findings on increasing range of motion, and reducing pain, medication intake, and swelling [64], more definite conclusions need to be built upon more high-quality evidence [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Some potential study limitations should be mentioned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>First, the study did not include a sham IFT electro-massage group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Second, only immediate results after the last session of the two-week intervention protocol were collected, thus it would be highly relevant to investigate the medium and long-term follow-up effects of IFT on post-operative pain in further studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Third, the therapist in charge of the interventions was not blinded to participants allocation group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Finally, further research is warranted to investigate if different results could be expected using different current parameters. </plain></SENT>
