Data were analysed and reported blind to patient identity and clinical course. Primary variables of interest were the two physical fitness measures; oxygen uptake at estimated anaerobic threshold and oxygen uptake at Peak exercise (ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and the post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery rate constant (min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), a measure of muscle mitochondrial capacity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Median age was 67 years (IQR 64&#x02013;75).

In 2013, &#x0223c;9000 patients were diagnosed with rectal cancer (35% aged &#x0003e;75 y), of whom &#x0223c;4600 underwent major resection with a 90-day elective postoperative mortality of 2.5% <xref rid="pone.0111526-Association1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. 25% are locally advanced (Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) stage - T3/T4N+) cancers (i.e. resection margin threatened) considered for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) to control local disease and to achieve tumour downsizing and negative resection margins <xref rid="pone.0111526-HabrGama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111526-Grard1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; however, external beam radiation and oral or intravenous fluoropyrimidines causes dose-limiting toxicity, reaching Grade 3&#x02013;5 in 20% (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0). It is unknown to what extent NACRT affects physical fitness in this patient cohort.</p><p>Poor physical fitness, assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), is linked to poor postoperative outcomes after major surgery <xref rid="pone.0111526-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0111526-Hennis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. CPET provides an integrated quantitative assessment of the cardiorespiratory system at rest and under the stress of maximal exercise, testing the physiological reserve required to withstand the stress of surgery. Subjective assessment tools have been used to predict surgical outcomes, but there is little evidence linking objectively-measured physical fitness and surgical outcome in this group. The UK National Bowel Cancer Audit found the American Society of Anaesthesiologists &#x02013; Physical Status (ASA-PS) score (a categorical descriptor of fitness for surgery) to be the strongest predictor of death within 30 days of surgery <xref rid="pone.0111526-Finan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Only two trials have suggested that rectal cancer patients with a higher subjective performance status (WHO Score &#x0003e;1) have worse post-operative outcome after combined chemotherapy or chemo-radiation and surgery <xref rid="pone.0111526-Swellengrebel1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111526-Marijen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Studies investigating objective changes in physical fitness in patients receiving neoadjuvant cancer treatments are lacking <xref rid="pone.0111526-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated a significant reduction in objectively measured physical fitness with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in upper gastrointestinal cancer which was associated with reduced 1 year survival <xref rid="pone.0111526-Jack1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and a similar reduction in fitness with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer which was associated with in-hospital morbidity <xref rid="pone.0111526-West3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

This nested mechanism pilot study forms part of a larger clinical trial which began in March 2011. Ethics approval for the main trial was given by the North West &#x02013; Liverpool East Research and Ethics Committee (11/H1002/12) in March 2011, with a subsequent amendment (11/H1002/12c) adding <sup>31</sup>P MRS measurements for this nested mechanism pilot sub-study approved in January 2012. The larger trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01325909 &#x02013; March 2011), and initially this NCT registration was taken to cover all aspects of the larger trial, including the present pilot study. Subsequently the pilot study was registered separately (NCT 01859442 &#x02013; May 2013), and as a result of this change of approach this specific registration post-dated the recruitment of the first patients reported here, for which studies commenced in October 2012. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients were followed up until surgery, with the last patient exiting the study in October 2013.</p><p>We recruited consecutive patients between October 2012 and July 2013 who were referred to the Colorectal Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT), age &#x02265;18 y, with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer (circumferential resection margin threatened), scheduled for standardized NACRT on the basis of Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification &#x0003e;T2/N+ with no distant metastasis <xref rid="pone.0111526-Sobin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and WHO Performance Status &#x0003c;2 <xref rid="pone.0111526-Oken1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Predefined exclusion criteria were: inability to give informed consent, non-resectable disease, standard MR exclusion criteria, inability to exercise studies due to leg dysfunction, and patients who declined surgery or NACRT, or who received non-standard NACRT.</p><p>TNM staging involved flexible sigmoidoscopy for histological diagnosis, colonoscopy, chest, abdomen and pelvis computer-aided tomography (CT) and a 1.5T pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients then underwent standardised NACRT for 5 weeks. Standardized radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions on weekdays using a 3-dimensional conformal technique with CT guidance. A boost dose was given (5.4 Gy in 3 fractions) to the primary tumour only. Oral capecitabine (825 mg.m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was given twice daily on radiotherapy days. No patients received brachytherapy. The colorectal multidisciplinary team (MDT) was blind to CPET results, which therefore did not influence perioperative management.

<sup>31</sup>P MRS assessments of muscle mitochondrial function in quadriceps were carried out using a Siemens 3T Trio MR scanner (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) using an isometric knee extension exercise protocol. Subjects lay supine (secured with a Velcro strap across the hips) with the right knee flexed over a rigid foam support in a custom-built rig permitting isometric knee extension exercise against a strap across the anterior lower shin/ankle connected to an aluminium bar fitted with a strain gauge. <sup>31</sup>P MRS data were acquired from right quadriceps muscle using a dual-tuned 18 cm/15 cm diameter <sup>31</sup>P/<sup>1</sup>H surface coil (RAPID Biomedical, Rimpar, Germany), Velcro-strapped to the anterior thigh (midway between anterior superior iliac spine and patella). After automated set-up and manual shimming using tissue water signal, a 4-scan fully relaxed (TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10s) spectrum and a 32-scan partially saturated (TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2s) resting spectrum were collected. The exercise protocol consisted of 5 min rest followed by 2 bouts of isometric exercise (paced at 2 s on, 2 s off by an audible cue, exercise force being fed back visually via an LED display) each followed by 7 min recovery, while spectra were collected (TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2s) every 8 s. Two exercise intensities were used, corresponding to 70% and 90% of maximal voluntary contraction established in 3 brief trials prior to MRS acquisition (in pilot experiments these intensities gave acceptable PCr depletion with minimal acidification in typical subjects). Block MRS data output files from exercise-recovery acquisitions were converted to text using a specially-written MATLAB routine. All <sup>31</sup>P MRS data were processed using the java-based Magnetic Resonance User Interface (jMRUI v.3.0), using the AMARES time-domain fitting algorithm. Data were fitted assuming Lorentzian lineshapes for phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ATP (&#x003b2;-ATP a 1&#x02236;2&#x02236;1 triplet, &#x003b1;-ATP and &#x003b3;-ATP both 1&#x02236;1 doublets). The chemical shift of Pi relative to PCr was used by standard means to determine intracellular pH. PCr recovery time courses were fitted to a monoexponential function to estimate the recovery rate constant (k<sub>PCr</sub> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>): in the absence of appreciable changes in pH, this is an accepted measure of effective muscle mitochondrial function. As k<sub>PCr</sub> did not differ significantly between the two exercise intensities, and as pH changes were small throughout, values of k<sub>PCr</sub> are presented as mean of the two intensities <xref rid="pone.0111526-Kemp2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>All patients underwent CPET, PA monitoring and <sup>31</sup>P MRS 2 weeks before NACRT (baseline) and immediately post-NACRT (post-NACRT) that is within 48 hours of finishing NACRT.

We also found a significant decline in PA with NACRT (&#x02212;1627 steps). This acute decline in mitochondrial function may account for the rapid loss in fitness and activity over the neoadjuvant treatment period, clinically important in the context of fitness for surgery and perioperative risk however causality cannot be established as controlling for PA in a clinical setting is difficult, and statistical adjustment for PA in a small patient group is not feasible. These findings however illuminate a potential mechanistic link that might be contributing to the changes in objectively measured whole body physical fitness with NACRT, consistent with the results of our earlier pilot study <xref rid="pone.0111526-West3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Cancer-induced cachexia can cause major loss of skeletal muscle, resulting in fatigue and higher mortality <xref rid="pone.0111526-Tisdale1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0111526-Gilliam1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our cohort cancer progression is not a contributing factor as tumours were downstaged. Furthermore BMI and weight remained stable.

Similar mechanisms might mediate the decline in physical fitness in our cohort. The acute decline in PA seen might also contribute to changes in mitochondrial function and physical fitness. A better understanding and quantification of the potential mechanisms involved if oxidative injury is present in this patient cohort is essential to design intervention strategies that will attenuate the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy agents without compromising their anticancer effects <xref rid="pone.0111526-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>
</p><p>Our findings have potential clinical implications because reduced physical fitness is associated with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality after major intra-abdominal surgery, especially colorectal surgery <xref rid="pone.0111526-West2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111526-Hennis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111526-West4" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> Our data provides the first direct evidence that the benefits of NACRT in tumour downsizing may be at least partly offset by increased perioperative risk as a result of reduced physical fitness, related to reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and activity however causality cannot be established. This proposed mechanism merits further investigation, as does the possibility of preventive interventions e.g. by exercise training during the pre-operative period (currently the focus of our published exercise training study <xref rid="pone.0111526-West5" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>). This is an interventional pilot study in the same patient cohort scheduled to undergo standardised NACRT and a 6-week structured, tailored exercise training programme (exercise group n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) or a control period (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13).

Furthermore a randomised controlled study investigating the potential benefits in physical fitness and quality of life of a 9-week structured responsive endurance training programme following NACRT prior to elective rectal cancer surgery (PB-PG-0711-25093) is currently recruiting.</p><p>This study demonstrates an acute decline in objectively-measured physical fitness, activity as well as a decline in mitochondrial function using validated and robust methodology. Particular strengths of our study are the low risk of confounding by indication <xref rid="pone.0111526-Grocott1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, the blinded physiological evaluations, the standardization of the NACRT and the homogenous cancer cohort. Limitations lie in the observational design, the small sample size of what was designed as a pilot study and that no adjusting for multiple testing was performed.</p><p>In conclusion, NACRT before major rectal cancer surgery significantly reduces physical fitness objectively assessed by CPET and muscle mitochondrial function assessed by <sup>31</sup>P MRS. The existence of abnormalities at both skeletal-muscle and whole-body level may perhaps suggest a potential mechanistic relationship in NACRT which merits further investigation, which could potentially inform development of tailored interventions in the perioperative period to improve both physical fitness and mitochondrial function in patients with operable rectal cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111526.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
