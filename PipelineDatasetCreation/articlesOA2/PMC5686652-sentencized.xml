<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overproduction of proinflammatory adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 [3], along with reduced AT capability of storing free fatty acids and the resultant aberrant efflux of free fatty acids into the circulation, lead to insulin resistance and its related diseases [1, 4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that AT dysfunction is a determinant of worse metabolic profile and higher cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1, or Cyr61/CTGF/NOV) is an extracellular matrix–associated protein belonging to the Cyr61/CTGF/NOV family, which includes matricellular proteins operating at the border between cells and extracellular matrix and exerts regulatory actions on several cellular responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Thus, WISP1 is involved in a broad spectrum of biological functions and pathological processes [8–16]; is mainly expressed during organ development and under diseased conditions, such as fibrosis [11–15], cancer [9, 10, 13] , and inflammatory diseases [16]; and has recently been proposed as a novel adipokine [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>WISP1 is widely expressed in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) human AT, is released by fully differentiated human adipocytes, and stimulates cytokine responses in AT-associated macrophages [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Circulating WISP1 concentration correlates with its expression in AT, which therefore represents a major source of this adipokine in humans [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Among the many cell types on which it exerts proliferative effects, WISP1 has induced proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells and, thus, AT expansion, in experimental models of visceral obesity [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although an association between WISP1 expression in AT inflammation and insulin resistance has been described in persons with normal glucose tolerance [17], no evidence on its role in AT inflammation in conditions of impaired glucose regulation has been produced so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Increased circulating WISP1 levels were recently reported in a study among women with gestational diabetes; this study identified greater body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance during pregnancy as determinants of increased WISP1 [19]; however, as far as we know, no study has evaluated circulating WISP1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of plasma WISP1 levels in identifying patterns of AT inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Briefly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was diagnosed in patients with hepatic fat fraction of ≥5.5% [23]; VAT and SAT were quantified by acquiring a three-dimensional gradient echo T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination sequence on an axial plane modified by Dixon [repetition time, 4.7 msec; echo time, 2.3 msec; flip angle, 10°; matrix, 256 ×192 mm; section thickness, 5 mm (reconstructed 2.5 mm); intersection gap, 0] and analyzing the fat-only data sets with specific software (Slice-O-Matic; Tomovision Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada) [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that circulating WISP1 levels are increased in obese persons and directly related to visceral adiposity, independent of glycemic status or insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, higher WISP1 is strongly associated with increased IL-8, reduced adiponectin, and impaired VAT homogeneity at MRI. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>This study investigated WISP1 in the presence of type 2 diabetes, its potential implication in AT dysfunction, and its related conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>Recently, Murahovschi et al. [17] conducted an elegant systematic investigation of WISP1 gene expression in human SAT and VAT samples from mostly glucose-tolerant participants with a broad spectrum of body weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>These authors detected high WISP1 expression in AT—mostly in the visceral compartment—and found a negative association with insulin sensitivity and circulating adiponectin levels, whereas WISP1 expression directly correlated with visceral fat content at MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested a role of this adipokine as a potential marker of visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our results obtained in patients with type 2 diabetes, Murahovschi et al. did not find any association between WISP1 expression and the presence of NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>In our study, WISP1 concentration did not differ significantly between diabetic and nondiabetic participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>Bivariate correlation analyses performed in all study participants showed that plasma levels of this adipokine were not associated with FBG or lipid profile and, in the presence of type 2 diabetes, did not correlate with glycemic control or duration of diabetes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IL-8 was the main determinant of increased WISP1 concentration in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>Because IL-8 is a well-known mediator of AT inflammation [3], overall our results may suggest that increased WISP1 levels do not portray conditions such as overweight or diabetes per se but rather are a systemic marker of impaired AT homeostasis and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>Studies conducted in other pathological conditions (i.e., lung idiopathic primary fibrosis [11, 12] and cardiac fibrosis [15, 16]) demonstrated that WISP1 displays an active role in determining tissue fibrosis and remodeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>In particular, increased WISP1 levels were detected in fibroblasts from idiopathic primary fibrosis [11]; in these cells, proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, such as TNF-α and TGF-β1, induced WISP1 expression through a nuclear factor κB–dependent mechanism; WISP1, in turn, promoted IL-6–mediated fibrosis processes [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>In addition, WISP1 and WNT pathways took part in processes leading to cardiac fibrosis and myocardial remodeling [14] and mediated angiotensin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrotic damage [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that the increase in WISP1, in the presence of AT inflammation, may induce AT remodeling and aberrant fibrogenesis, which is responsible, in turn, for AT loss of function, insulin resistance, and its consequences [26–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis, ascribing to WISP1 a causal role in AT dysfunction, is strongly corroborated by data from Murahovschi et al. [17] showing that in human macrophages and mesenchymal stem cell–derived adipocytes, 24-hour incubation with WISP1 induces significant and dose-dependent increase of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 messenger RNA expression and protein level in medium [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>In our study, we explored the possibility of identifying areas of impaired VAT homogeneity at MRI, which could reflect AT inflammation, by qualitative assessment of AT intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>We found inhomogeneous VAT in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes characterized by a peculiar systemic proinflammatory profile; notably, circulating WISP1 levels showed a great predictive power for VAT inhomogeneity in our population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>Previous experimental studies demonstrated that standard routine MRI sequences can depict brown AT, characterized by intense metabolic activity and increased cellularity, in vivo [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>Similarly, data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis showed that the presence of low VAT radiodensity at computed tomography was independently associated with a worse systemic inflammatory profile and higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a large US population [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated the possible role of standard MRI, a radiation-free alternative to computed tomography, in identifying AT inhomogeneity likely referable to local inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="444" pm="."><plain>This approach could represent a complementary tool for risk stratification in patients at increased cardiovascular risk and warrants further investigation in larger populations and in the context of trials specifically designed for this purpose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="445" pm="."><plain>Our study explored WISP1 in the presence of type 2 diabetes and assessed the association between circulating WISP1 levels and markers of AT inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>In our study population, WISP1 assessment showed low sensitivity and high SDs, which might represent a limitation for using this molecule as a routine marker for screening AT inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>Besides this consideration, increased WISP1 levels have been shown to specifically identify a peculiar phenotype of patients characterized by the presence of visceral fat distribution and worse circulating proinflammatory profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 93% of patients with plasma WISP1 levels &gt;0 displayed high IL-8 levels, and the association between the circulating concentration of these two molecules persisted after adjustment for possible confounders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Although we are aware that specific conditions, such as tissue inflammation, may benefit from a biopsy-proven diagnosis, our population did not meet any clinical criteria for performing an invasive procedure, such as AT biopsy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in our study, AT dysfunction has been estimated by dosing highly accurate circulating biomarkers and exploring qualitative aspects at MRI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our population underwent detailed metabolic phenotyping, allowing us to investigate a broad spectrum of potential correlates of increased WISP1 levels in plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>Thus, this composite cluster of systemic and imaging data related to AT dysfunction may prove to be useful in identifying dysmetabolic conditions and in the follow-up of targeted treatments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>Finally, we acknowledge that the cross-sectional design of our study does not allow us to establish with certainty a causal nexus between higher WISP1 and IL-8 levels or between VAT inhomogeneity and worse circulating inflammatory profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further studies with longitudinal design are warranted for fully understanding the pathophysiologic processes behind our observations and the possible clinical implications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="455" pm="."><plain>In summary, circulating WISP1 levels are increased in obese persons and directly related to adiposity, independent of glycemic status or insulin resistance; moreover, they are strongly associated with increased plasma IL-8 and signal abnormalities of VAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>The overall data add insights to the mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations and may open a scenario for innovative therapeutic approaches to diabetes prevention and care. </plain></SENT>
