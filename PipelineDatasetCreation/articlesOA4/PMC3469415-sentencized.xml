<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Genotyping and sequencing technologies allow large sample populations to be characterized at high or base-pair resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Parallel advances in quantitative phenotyping provide multidimensional descriptions of phenotypic states, often encompassing multiple molecular and physiological assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Additionally, RNA transcript quantification is often used to provide a detailed view of cellular states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Translating this high-throughput, quantitative data into predictive models of health and disease will require new analytical methods to understand how genetic variants combine to influence multiple phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>One potentially powerful approach is the systematic study of genetic interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In molecular biology, genetic interaction analysis has been used to infer functional relationships such as activation, repression, and pathway ordering [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>More recently, genome-scale interaction analysis has revealed functional genomic architecture in yeast [2]–[7], worm [8], [9], and fly [10], [11] model systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Although equivalent genetic resources do not yet exist in mammalian model systems, new and forthcoming mouse populations will provide a basis for genetic interaction analysis in mammalian models [12]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, the systematic interpretation of individual genetic interactions in terms of functional models has proven challenging in combinatorial genetic screens [5], [17], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This ambiguity is even more pronounced in population-based studies, in which instances of statistical epistasis in highly powered studies rarely have clear biological interpretation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In some cases biological etiology can be resolved by pathway-based approaches that consider combinations of loci to detect polygenic risk [19], [20], but discovery is potentially limited by incomplete information on pathway structure and interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Studies of quantitative trait loci that affect gene expression (eQTL) identify multiple transcripts affected by interactions among genetic variants via cis and trans acting elements [21]–[27], providing insights into genetic influence on biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Interaction studies in this approach can be limited by the cost of assaying sufficiently large sample numbers and ambiguous connections to physiological phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In all of these cases, methods that directly infer the structure of genetic networks would provide a data-driven model of how the genetic variation in a population organizes to affect complex traits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe a new method to use complementary information in multiple phenotype measurements to infer the network structure of genetic interactions in terms of directional influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The method requires two or more quantitative phenotypes that share some common genetic factors but are not completely correlated across all individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This reliance on partial pleiotropy is consistent with, and possibly a prerequisite to, the evolution of statistical epistasis [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>It suggests a set of phenotypes that measure different aspects of the same complex trait or condition, such as a serum-based molecular biomarker paired with a whole-organism physiological measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The method exploits the pleiotropy inherent in such a system to interpret instances of epistasis (in the statistical sense [29]) in terms of network models of genetic interactions that represent underlying biology [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The resulting network is constructed in terms of variant-to-variant influences, each quantifying how one gene variant affects the activity of a second variant, and variant-to-phenotype influences that quantify how each variant influences each phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Interactions between variants can be either inter-locus (classical genetic interactions) or intra-locus (for a gene with multiple alleles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Our central assumption is that the spectrum of genetic interactions observed across multiple phenotypes is due to multiple manifestations of the same underlying network of variant-to-variant influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>By simultaneously analyzing interactions for multiple phenotypes, ambiguities are resolved to arrive at a consistent interpretation of each genetic interaction (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>First, since we are interested in modeling interactions for an arbitrarily large number of genetic variants in a population, the method is designed to assess individual variants rather than genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The method therefore has the capability to address multiple allele forms at a given genetic locus, each with a potentially unique effect, and the inferred interactions describe the effect of each variant on every other variant's activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Second, this work uses linear regression methods to estimate the single and double mutant effects across a population rather than by direct measurements that are only possible with engineered mutations on an isogenic strain background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Third, the extensive genetic diversity and large sample sizes of most intercross and natural populations require methods that can rapidly compute and assess the significance of interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Therefore the methods in this paper are mathematically simple and computationally fast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Finally, the networks derived in this work are constructed by analyzing each genetic interaction in isolation rather than obtaining a solution that simultaneously models all possible interactions [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Although a more comprehensive approach might be feasible with our test population, the abundance of genetic diversity and limited sample sizes of most populations will have insufficient statistical power for such analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Thus for computational and statistical tractability we develop methods to build networks from a very large number of pair-wise interactions, each inferred in isolation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We tested our approach using a combination of molecular and colony-level assays of yeast mating competence across a population of strains with mutations of mating genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We derived a genetic interaction network that is readily interpreted in terms of pathway genetics, mapping variant-to-variant interactions between mutations at different loci and variant-to-phenotype influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We next analyzed gene expression to reveal the partially overlapping and partially distinct biological processes that underlie the phenotypic complementarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We further analyzed the gene expression data to derive a similar interaction network and demonstrate the method's applicability to eQTL data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The PR phenotype shares many genetic components with the ME phenotype and therefore ensured a degree of pleiotropy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>However, because the PR assay was more narrowly focused on pheromone signaling, PR and ME were not expected to be entirely redundant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For example, strains with moderate defects in pheromone signaling may be mating competent (or hyper-competent) due to compensatory mutations that affect other biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>As expected, the ME and PR phenotypes were significantly correlated (Pearson r = 0.48, p = 3.3×10−14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>To maximize complementarity between these phenotypes, we performed singular value decomposition (SVD) (Methods). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>We performed pair-wise linear regression on the eigentraits (Figure 2B; Methods, Eq. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>This procedure reinterprets statistical epistasis in terms of a genetic influences model.

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The strongest direct effects were from perturbations of canonical downstream pathway elements Far1 and Fus3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The far1Δ effect on ME was stronger than its effect on PR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Our gene expression analysis provides evidence that this was due to the role of Far1 in cell cycle regulation, a biological process that contributed to our ME phenotype but not PR (Results). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The bar1Δ mutation had a very strong effect on PR but did not have a significant effect on ME. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This was likely due to the fact that Bar1 degrades the alpha pheromone and thus its knockout leads to enhanced MAPK pathway activity [32].This Bar1 activity also enhances escape from pheromone-induced cell-cycle arrest to reinitiate proliferation [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The six variant-to-variant influences comprised a network view of how the perturbations affect one another and, in turn, the downstream phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The Msg5 phosphatase is known to affect mating by dephosphorylating the MAP kinase Fus3 [40], which is consistent with the suppression of msg5Δ effects by the fus3Δ allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The fus3Δ allele also suppresses the effects of bar1Δ and STE11-4, two genes that are upstream of Fus3 in the canonical MAPK pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The moderate suppression of far1Δ by the STE11-4 allele was consistent with the previous finding that MAPK pathway activation can provide compensatory cell cycle arrest in the absence of Far1 [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Our gene expression data set provided additional data for genetic interaction modeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>SVD modes have been demonstrated to be a suitable basis for statistical genetic analysis of gene expression [41] and we extended this concept to our pair-scan method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We modeled the first three SVD modes, comprising 73% of the global variation (Methods), which captured multiple biological processes (Table 2 and Table S3) and was suitable for the analysis of a relatively small sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Although there were substantially fewer samples than the phenotype data (92 versus 218 strains), the samples were selected for genetic diversity and the SVD modes provide more precise summary phenotypes because they are averaged over hundreds of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the analysis was sufficiently powered to identify significant interactions and map a network model with five variant-to-variant influences (Figure S4 and Table S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Three of these were identical in direction and sign to the ME/PR model (Figure 3), with two additional interactions that did not qualify as significant in the ME/PR model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The two independently-analyzed data sets thus uncover generally similar interaction networks with different details. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>We added additional SVD modes to the analysis on an exploratory basis and derived similar interactions but, as expected, found decreasing significance as signals were added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>For example, the fus3Δ suppression of msg5Δ obtained in the ME/PR model (p = 0.006) was derived at similar interaction strength when taking three, four, or five SVD modes but with decreasing significance (p = 0.026, p = 0.030, and p = 0.076, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>This reduction in significance was due to adding additional signals without increasing population size. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Using only the genotype and phenotype information in our population, we identified many features of the mating pathway in haploid yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This serves as a strong validation of population-based analysis approach for mapping genetic interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Both the direct variant-to-phenotype influences and the suppressive variant-to-variant influences in our network (Figure 3) support previous findings that were based on targeted genetic perturbations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>However, in some cases we did not find naively expected edges due to the averaging of direct influences over all models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>While we found that the averaged influences were generally consistent, the averaging procedure occasionally resulted in insignificant mean values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>For example, although we inferred a positive influence of msg5Δ on mating efficiency (Table S4) the averaged influence did not meet our significance criterion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The relative weakness of this effect was possibly compounded by its effect on cellular morphology during mating [33] that might be of lesser importance in the phenotypes we measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Similarly, while STE11-4 significantly increased both ME and PR when considered with fus3Δ (Figure 2D), its positive influence on ME was diluted and fell below significance when averaged over all pairs involving STE11-4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This was the result of averaging over the effects of all pair-wise regressions, and could lead to false negatives if real effects are averaged out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the averaging procedure successfully identified effects missed in single-locus scans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>We also note the variant-to-variant influences are uniquely determined and thus do not require averaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, resolving these genetic interactions requires that the phenotypes contain sufficient complementary information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Our network (Figure 3) represents the edges for which there is evidence in our particular data set rather than the map of all possible interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In this case we found that the complementary information is sufficient to recover an informative network of genetic interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we independently derived a network from a gene expression data that contained similar interactions (Figure S4), further validating our approach and results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Because genetic interactions are always defined in the context of one or more specific phenotypes, the success of our technique crucially depends on the choice of phenotypes assayed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The quantitative accuracy and repeatability of molecular phenotypes such as gene expression are desirable for their large signal-to-noise potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we used microarray data to obtain a network of how interacting variants (Figure S4) combine to affect specific biological processes (Table 2 and Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>However, our method is also suitable to measurements at a higher level, such as quantitative cellular and physiological phenotypes, which often have greater sample sizes and are more directly related to a disease-related phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Although our analysis technique involves recasting phenotypes in terms of maximum orthogonality, a crucial requirement is that the phenotypes manifest some degree of genetic overlap along with components of genetic independence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This reliance on partial pleiotropy suggests that the higher level phenotypes may be more powerful as they can involve a broader mix of partially overlapping biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the more complex biological basis of our colony-level mating efficiency assay provided the complementary information to our pheromone-specific molecular reporter necessary to successfully infer genetic interactions between alleles of mating genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Our method is flexible and extendable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In this study we inferred an interaction network with two quantitative phenotypes, which is the minimal but not limiting number. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The analysis can be straightforwardly expanded for an arbitrary number of phenotypes (Methods, Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>5), and information gains can be expected for the portion of each added phenotype that is uncorrelated with existing phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>However, in our gene expression analysis we found that the inclusion of additional orthogonal modes did not add novel information in terms of enriched GO processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, adding phenotypes without increasing the relatively small sample size weakened statistical significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In other cases a larger sample size might resolve additional interactions and/or biological processes, but measuring genome-wide RNA abundances for a large number (e.g. hundreds) of samples remains expensive and cost constraints will often limit these measurements to a selected subset of the population based on genetic diversity or extreme phenotypic variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In this study we followed this approach by using gene expression on a subset of samples to reveal the biology that underlies the cellular phenotypes, but our approach could have been readily applied to gene expression in the full population if resources were unlimited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>As with all statistical-based methods, our approach has analytical limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>For more than two phenotypes a dimensional reduction occurs due to the fact that the approach is limited to pair-wise analyses and therefore a loss of fit accuracy compared to the combination of all pair-wise regressions for each phenotype independently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This is independent of the number of phenotypes (or SVD modes) fit and limits the amount of variance that can be modeled, while automatically maximizing information for each variant pair (Methods, Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This limitation could be alleviated by performing analysis of three or more variants simultaneously [2], possibly by selectively analyzing interacting cliques in a pair-wise study, but extending beyond pair-wise analysis would likely be limited by the corresponding computational expense and statistical power requirements, especially in gene expression studies with limited sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The approach could also be minimally applied to interpret only locus pairs with statistically significant epistasis in one or more phenotypes; however this limited treatment may miss pair-wise interactions that become significant only when both phenotypes are jointly considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In general, we expect the power requirements for our pair-wise approach to be equal to or less than that of standard pair-wise locus scans, with the potential power gain due to the simultaneous use of information in multiple phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
