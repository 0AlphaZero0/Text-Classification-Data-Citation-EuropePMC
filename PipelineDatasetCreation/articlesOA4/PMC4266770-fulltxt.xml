After 6 weeks, patients could use celecoxib 400 mg once daily or maintain blinded therapy. The primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline at Week 6 for Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment of Pain Intensity score (100-mm visual analog scale). Noninferiority was established if the upper bound of the CI was &#x0003c;10 mm. Secondary objectives included patients&#x02019; and physicians&#x02019; assessments of disease activity, change from baseline in C-reactive protein level, and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the per-protocol analysis set the least squares mean change from baseline in the Patient&#x02019;s Global Assessment of Pain Intensity score at Week 6 was &#x02013;23.8 mm and &#x02013;27.1 mm in patients receiving celecoxib (n = 111) and diclofenac (n = 108), respectively. The 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference (celecoxib &#x02013; diclofenac) was &#x02013;2.2 to 8.8. Overall, 4.2% and 6.7% of patients in the celecoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively, reported treatment-related adverse events.

The protocol was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each center, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and local regulatory requirements. The study consisted of a double-blind treatment period lasting 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week extension period. All patients provided written informed consent before any screening procedures were performed.</p><p>The study included a total of 6 study visits: screening visit (Visit 1), baseline visit (Visit 2), Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 6 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6 for those enrolled in the extension period) or when the study drug was terminated (end-of-treatment visit) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

In addition, patients were excluded if they required the use of concomitant muscle relaxants, hypnotics, anxiolytics, sedatives, tranquillizers, or antidepressant drugs, or the concomitant use of anticoagulants, ticlopidine, lithium, aspirin &#x0003e;150 mg/d, methotrexate &#x0003e;15 mg/wk, prednisolone &#x0003e;10 mg/d (or equivalent dose of other corticosteroids), NSAIDs, or COX-2 inhibitors (other than study drug or biologics).

Randomization was performed using a computer-generated schedule that generated a random permuted-blocks design. Each patient qualifying for a treatment assignment was given the next consecutive number within a center and was dispensed the corresponding study medication. To ensure that the treatment remained blinded to the investigators and patients during the double-blind period, a double-dummy method of blinding was used (celecoxib 200 mg capsules, diclofenac SR 75 mg tablets, and their respective matching placebos were similar in size, color, smell, taste, and appearance). Rescue medication in the form of acetaminophen/paracetamol could be taken on demand, but the dose could not exceed a total daily dose of 2 g.</p><p>All patients who exhibited no study medication-related AEs were offered extension treatment at the end of the 6-week, double-blind period; patients in the celecoxib 200 mg once daily (C200) and diclofenac SR 75 mg once daily (D75) groups received either open-label celecoxib 400 mg once daily (herein referred to as the C200/C400 or D75/C400 group) or continuation of their double-blind period therapies (herein referred to as the C200 or D75 no treatment change [NTC] groups) for an additional 6 weeks. In the extension phase, assignment to celecoxib 400 mg once daily was open to the investigators, patients, and the sponsor&#x02019;s study team. Patients who maintained their celecoxib 200 mg once daily or diclofenac SR 75 mg once daily therapies were dispensed medication in the same manner they had received medication during the double-blind phase. These patients remained blinded to the study medication assignments.

Although NSAIDs are widely used in the treatment of AS, a number of safety and tolerability concerns surrounding their use (particularly over the longer term) still exist. Meanwhile, data supporting the use of alternative therapeutic options, such as COX-2 selective NSAIDs, are lacking. In the absence of direct head-to-head comparisons between COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs in China, the present study was conducted. Diclofenac SR was selected as the active control because it is widely used by patients who have AS.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The double-blind treatment duration of 6 weeks was chosen because celecoxib has been shown to be statistically superior to placebo in placebo-controlled clinical studies of 6 to 12 weeks&#x02019; duration in patients with AS.<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> Using the ASAS-20 response criteria, no changes in the response rates at Week 12 compared with Week 6 were demonstrated. A 6-week extension was also conducted to observe the safety profile and to collect efficacy data for celecoxib 400 mg in Chinese patients.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that celecoxib 200 mg once daily was noninferior to diclofenac SR 75&#x000a0;mg once daily in the treatment of Chinese patients with AS. In addition, patients in the celecoxib 200 mg once daily group experienced similar improvements in pain relief, disease activity, and physical function compared with patients receiving diclofenac SR 75 mg once daily. This finding is consistent with those of similarly designed studies in AS using the same comparator treatment.<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref></p><p>According to previous reports,<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> celecoxib 400 mg once daily reduces some parameters of inflammation more effectively than celecoxib 200 mg once daily, suggesting a possible dose-dependent effect and potentially better treatment outcomes with the higher dose. The results of our analysis support this. At the end of the extension period (Week 12), celecoxib 400 mg once daily noticeably advanced the extent of improvements in patients who did not achieve satisfactory improvement in signs and symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with celecoxib 200 mg once daily.</p><p>GI disorders are a well-known side effect of NSAID use;<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> however, celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of the inducible form of the COX enzyme (ie, COX-2), is thought to be better tolerated and associated with fewer AEs than the more traditional nsNSAIDs that act via nonselective inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2.<xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31&#x02013;35</sup></xref> Notably, in the Celecoxib versus Omeprazole and Diclofenac for at-Risk Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients trial, the rate of predefined and adjudicated clinically significant upper and lower GI events (the primary end point) was 4 times higher in patients with arthritis at increased GI risk who were receiving diclofenac SR 75 mg twice daily plus omeprazole 20 mg once daily than in those receiving celecoxib 200 mg twice daily during 6 months of treatment.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p><p>In our study, although GI disorders were the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in both treatment groups during the double-blind phase, a similar number of GI AEs and discontinuations due to GI AEs were reported in patients receiving celecoxib 200 mg once daily compared with diclofenac SR 75 mg once daily.
