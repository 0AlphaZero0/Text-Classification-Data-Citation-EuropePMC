</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In flowering plants, approximately 90% species produce bisexual flowers with specialized male and female organs in the same flower, while 6% species are dioecious with separate male and female plants, and the remaining species are monoecious, producing male and female flowers on the same individual [1], [2]. Arabidopsis thaliana is a model species for bisexual plant, whose flowers consist of four types of floral organs arranged into concentric whorls, specifically sepals in outermost (whorl 1), petals in whorl 2, stamens in whorl 3 and carpels in innermost (whorl 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The patterning of floral organs in different whorls is controlled by the combinatorial interactions between three classes of homeotic genes, designated A, B, and C class of genes [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sepal identity is determined by the function of A genes APETALA1 and APETALA2, petal identity is specified by the simultaneous function of A and B genes (which include APETALA3 and PISTILLATA), stamen identity is determined by combinatorial action of B and C (provided by the AGAMOUS gene), whereas carpel identity is specified by C function alone [3]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Recently, D class of genes, FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN7 (FBP7) and FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN11 (FBP11), have been shown to be involved in carpel and ovule development, whereas E class of genes (provided by SEPALLATA 1-4) are required for all the floral organ development, thus the classical ABC model has been modified into ABCDE model for floral patterning [6]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, the cadastral gene SUPERMAN (SUP) has shown to be a negative regulator of B class of genes at the boundaries between stamens and carpels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Loss of function of AtSUP leads to extra stamen production in the fourth whorl at the expense of carpel development, and expansion of the B class of genes APETALA3 and PISTILLATA from the second and third whorls into the forth whorl [11], [12]. AtSUP encodes a C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in the subdomain of third whorl adjacent to the forth whorl, and may function at the boundaries to balance cell proliferation in whorl 3 and 4 [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The DLELRL hexapeptide in the AtSUP carboxy terminal domain confers the transcriptional repression activity and is required for the normal flower development [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition, AtSUP also function in cell proliferation suppression of outer integument on the adaxial side of the ovule [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In sup mutants, outer integument grows evenly and leads to production of infertile ovules that are radially symmetrical [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the function in ovule, AtSUP is expressed in the developing ovules and then limited to the stalks of ovules [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have explored the function of AtSUP upon ectopic expression in various species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of AtSUP under APETALA1 promoter leads to reduced size as well as decreased number of all four types of floral organs in Arabidopsis [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Similarly, ectopic expression of AtSUP using FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN1 (FBP1) promoter results in size reduction in petals and stamens in petunia or tobacco [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, when overexpressed under constitutive promoter in dicotyledonous species such as Arabidopsis or tobacco, AtSUP causes dwarfness at the whole plant level, and restores stamen development and produces functional pollen in an alloplasmic CMS tobacco plant [14], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>While overexpressed in monocotyledon such as rice, high level of AtSUP expression leads to juvenile death, and low level of AtSUP expression results in expansion of ventral carpel and decreased number of stamen [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, several orthologs of SUP have been cloned, including NtSUP in Nicotiana tabacum, PhSUP1 in Petunia hybrida and SlSUP in Silene latifolia, and their functions are generally conserved, but the expression patterns are quite divergent [19], [20], [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Despite the extensive studies of AtSUP and SUP orthologs, no study has been performed in monoecious plant with unisexual flowers on the same individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a typical monoecious species with male flowers produce at the bottom and female flowers form at the top. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cloned the SUP ortholog in cucumber designated as CsSUP, and the expression pattern of CsSUP was characterized by both qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. CsSUP is predominantly expressed in female organs: female flower buds and ovules of fruit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of CsSUP in Arabidopsis can partially complement the fruit development in sup-5 mutant, and its over-expression in wide-type leads to reduced silique length, suppressed stamen development, and disorganized petal patterning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that CsSUP possesses conserved functions in stamen and fruit development as well as a distinct role in floral patterning. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Three SUP-like genes were identified in cucumber, Csa000134, Csa001112 and Cas010435, in which Csa000134 displays the lowest e-value with AtSUP using both cDNA (3e-16) and deduced protein sequence (2e-17), thus was designated as CsSUP in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The cDNA of CsSUP were cloned from the female buds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Consistent with known SUP orthologs [12], [20], [22], [24], CsSUP has no intron, and the full length CsSUP encodes a protein of 171 amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>ClustalW was used to align the amino acid sequence of CsSUP with known SUP-like genes, including AtSUP and RABBIT EARS (RBE) in Arabidopsis, NtSUP in tobacco, PhSUP in petunia, SlSUP in white campion, and Os05g0286100 in rice [25] (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Despite CsSUP shows only 28.78%, 33.62%, 29.78% and 30.36% identity with AtSUP,NtSUP,PhSUP and SlSUP respectively, the zinc-finger domains and the leucine zipper (LZ)-like domains are highly conserved (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The DLELRL domains, which are required for transcriptional repression during cell proliferation in Arabidopsis and petunia [14], [15], are identical over all the proteins we aligned except for Csa001112. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the entire amino acid sequences using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 1B, CsSUP and Csa001112 belong to the same clade with known SUP orthologs, which are distinct from the clade consisting of SUP-like genes RBE, Os05g0286100 and Cas010435 [25], suggesting that CsSUP and Csa001112 maybe the SUP homologues in cucumber. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that CsSUP and Csa001112 display similar expression patterns, which are highly enriched in female specific tissues such as female flower buds and developing fruits, whereas there were very few expressions in other organs (Figure 2A, Figure S1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Given that CsSUP shows the highest sequence similarity with SUP orthologs, and the expression of CsSUP appears to be enriched in younger female tissues than that of Csa001112, we focus on characterization of CsSUP thereafter. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In the sup-5 mutant, number of stamens and carpels are increased, silique length is decreased and seed number is reduced (Figure 4A, 4D, 4G and 4H) [28], ectopic expression of CsSUP under native AtSUP promoter (pAtSUP::CsSUP;sup-5) (Figure 4B, 4E,4G and 4H) or constitutive 35S promoter (35S::CsSUP;sup-5) (Figure 4C, 4F and 4G) results in normal number of stamens and partially rescued silique length and morphology. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Transcripts of Arabidopsis SUP were first detected in late stage 3 flower primordia, and in boundaries between stamen and carpel primordia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Then, it was found in the adaxial side of the stamen primordia and later in stage 9, SUP RNA was detected in the ovary [13]. PhSUP, on the other hand, is expressed in the basal regions of developing petals and stamens, the interthecal regions of developing anthers, and the basal part of ovules [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>While the SlSUP gene is exclusively expressed in female flowers in Silene latifolia, in developing petals, stamens and ovules [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that CsSUP is mostly expressed in the female specific organs: the female flower buds and fruits (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Specifically, CsSUP is expressed throughout the IM, FM, and stage 1–2 floral primordia, then it is restricted to the boundary between petal and stamen at stage 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>By the time of unisexual flower is noticeable (stage 6 and on), CsSUP is expressed only in female flowers, in the boundary of developing ovary and in ovules (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the expression patterns of SUP orthologs are quite divergent, implying they may have distinct roles in bisexual flowers, dioecious species or monoecious species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Despite the specific domains are different, both CsSUP and SlSUP are expressed predominantly in female flowers, the reason of which may lie in the fact that both species produce unisexual flowers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>CsSUP has both conserved and divergent functions during flower and fruit development </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Arabidopsis AtSUP has been shown to function through cell proliferation to regulate the balance between stamen fate and carpel fate, as well as to control the growth of outer integument of ovule [13], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function of AtSUP results in increased number of stamen, defective carpel and infertile ovules [13], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of PhSUP or SlSUP in Arabidopsis can partially or fully rescue the excess stamen and infertile ovule phenotype in sup mutants [20], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Similarly, our study showed that overexpression of CsSUP can partially complement the sup-5 mutant phenotype, particularly the number of stamens, silique length and number of seeds per silique (Figure 4, Tables 1–2), suggesting that CsSUP plays a conserved role during stamen and ovule development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>However, constitutive expression of CsSUP in wild type Arabidopsis leads to disorganized patterning of petal, reduced number of stamen, decreased length of silique, reduced seed production and mild dwarfness of the whole plant (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Dwarfness, suppressed petal and stamen development have been reported previously when ectopic expression of AtSUP or SUP orthologs under the 35S promoter [14], [19], [20], [22], while decreased silique length and seed production, and disorganized petal patterning appears to be specific to CsSUP, suggesting that monoecious CsSUP may evolved a distinct roles in petal patterning and fruit development as compared to SUP orthologs in bisexual or dioecious species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Considering the unique expression of CsSUP in the boundary between petal and stamen primordia (Figure 3C), the boundary of developing ovary (Figure 3E), and in ovules (Figure 3F), CsSUP may function in the boundaries and ovules to modulate petal patterning, stamen and fruit development in Arabidopsis, probably through negative regulation of cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that depending on the species, cell types and expression level, AtSUP and SUP orthologs stimulated or suppressed cell division, cell expansion or cell elongation so that enabling proper flower and ovule development [17], [18], [20], [21], [24], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed that Arabidopsis and tobacco SUPs regulated cell proliferation through auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways in tobacco [24], and AtSUP suppresses cell division in floral meristem redundantly with a RNA helicase CARPEL FACTORY [33], and epigenetic modification-methylation is involved in the active or inactive state of AtSUP [34], [35] Therefore, tackling the underlining mechanism of CsSUP function in Arabidopsis, especially the potential relationship between CsSUP with hormones, RNA helicase and methylation modification during petal patterning and silique development, would be useful for gaining an entrance into understand how CsSUP might function in cucumber. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Further studies through RNA interference and genetic transformation, to explore the precise roles of CsSUP in cucumber would shed light on the evolutional scenery of SUP function in hermaphrodite, dioecious and monoecious species of flowering plants. </plain></SENT>
