</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Gastric cancer with enteroblastic differentiation (GCED) was proposed as a very rare variant of alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) and its clinicopathological features have not been well elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>There are few reports about GCED, and most are case reports. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In these earlier reported cases, GCED was histologically characterized as having a primitive intestine-like structure composed of cuboidal or columnar cells with clear cytoplasm[1-3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Murakami et al[4] reported 29 cases of GCED in which stages ranged from an early to an advanced stage based on clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>They proposed that GCED showed aggressive behavior such as lymphatic and venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis, and its clinicopathologic features were similar to those of AFPGC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, with the advent and widespread use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), indications for endoscopic treatment of early stage gastric cancer have been expanding rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is necessary for endoscopists to know the clinicopathological features of various histological types of early gastric cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, no report has focused on the early stage of GCED. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features of early stage GCED by comparisons with the early stage of conventional gastric cancer (CGC), including well or moderately differentiated carcinoma. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>All procedures were recorded in endoscopy databases on cases that underwent endoscopic resection in our hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The databases were examined to identify all cases of early stage GCED and CGC that underwent ESD or endoscopic mucosal resection from September 2011 to February 2015. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the comparison between early gastric cancer with a GCED component and early stage CGC clinicopathologically. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>GCED was defined as a tumor having a primitive intestine-like structure composed of cuboidal or columnar cells with clear cytoplasm and immunohistochemical positivity for either alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), Glypican 3 (clone 1G12, 1:200; BioMosaics, Burlington, VT, United States) or SALL4 (clone 6E3, 1:100; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>This study included 192 cases (144 males, 48 females; mean age 72.8 ± 7 years; 215 lesions) of early stage GCED and CGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Among 192 cases, there were 6 GCED cases (5 males, 1 female; mean age 75.7 years; 6 lesions) and 186 CGC cases (139 males, 47 females; mean age 72.7 years; 209 lesions). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Table 1 shows the clinicopathological findings of the patients with GCED and Table 2 shows results of the comparison between patients with GCED and CGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Four cases who were checked for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection by H. pylori-immunoglobulin G were positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in tumor location (U/M/L = 2/2/2 and 23/91/95 in GCED and CGC, respectively), mean tumor size (15.0 and 15.2 mm in GCED and CGC, respectively), and macroscopic types (flat or depressed type/ elevated type = 4/2 and 92/117 in GCED and CGC, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, we could not find specific features of GCED or anticipate deep submucosal invasion (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>No lesion was diagnosed as GCED by examination of biopsy specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Regarding the depth of tumor invasion, the total submucosal invasion rate was significantly higher in GCED than CGC (66.6% vs 11.4%, P &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Positive rates for lymphatic and venous invasion were significantly higher in GCED than CGC (33.3% vs 2.3% and 66.6% vs 0.4%, P &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the curative resection rate was significantly lower in GCED than CGC (16.7% vs 89.0%, P &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when comparing only SM invasive cancer, the positive rate for venous invasion was significantly higher in GCED than CGC (100% vs 4.2%, P &lt; 0.01) and the curative resection rate was significantly lower in GCED than CGC (0% vs 50%, P &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In 2 of the 6 GCED cases, additional surgery was performed (case 3: T1N0M0, stage IA; case 6: T1N1M0, stage IIA). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Since the first report of AFPGC by Bourreille et al[16] in 1970, many cases have been reported, and the specifics of this disease have been gradually clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Histologically, typical AFPGC has a liver-like structure and has been frequently reported as hepatoid adenocarcinoma[17-20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, there are also histologic types of carcinoma other than hepatoid adenocarcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In 1994, Matsunou et al[1] reported two cases of AFP-producing gastric carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (AFP-producing clear cell gastric carcinoma), and the tumor characteristics were as follows: (1) columnar carcinoma cells growing primarily in tubulopapillary and glandular patterns; (2) abundant glycogen, but no mucin production in the clear cytoplasm; (3) gut hormone-containing cells scattered among clear carcinoma cells; (4) carcinoma cells producing oncofetal glycoproteins such as AFP and CEA; and (5) ultrastructurally, carcinoma cells showing well-developed microvilli with core filaments, whose rootlets formed occasional terminal webs, consistent with absorptive epithelium of fetal intestine or enteroblastic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Motoyama et al[21] proposed that AFPGCs should be divided into three subtypes: (1) hepatoid type; (2) yolk sac type; and (3) fetal gastrointestinal type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>The fetal gastrointestinal type is thought to be equivalent to GCED[1,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>It is said that most AFPGCs have various mixtures of these histologic types and CGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Kinjo et al[2] also reported that in a histologic type of submucosal invasive cancer of AFPGC, the positivity rates for CGC and GCED in the mucosal component were significantly higher than in the invasive component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, hepatoid gastric carcinoma (HGC) was significantly positive in the invasive component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>In this study, pathological findings in all GCED cases showed that the mucosal layer was composed of conventional tubular adenocarcinoma and GCED. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>In addition, the superficial mucosal layer was covered with a conventional tubular adenocarcinoma, and there were no findings of GCED components exposed to the superficial layer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Therefore, since we could only collect superficial mucosal layer tissue for the biopsy specimens, we felt that GCED could not be diagnosed by examination of biopsy specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>The GCED component exists only in the deeper part of the mucosa to the submucosa by lymphatic and/or venous invasion but not in any other histological type of AFPGC (HGC and yolk sac type). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>As in previous reports[2,4] these findings suggested that GCED could be thought to develop from CGC and then gradually develop hepatoid features during the process of tumor invasion and proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>We considered that there is a possibility that early stage GCED represents the early developmental stage of AFPGC, which has various mixtures of histological types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Endoscopically, we diagnose the depth of invasion according to endoscopic features of gastric cancers with deep submucosal invasion (≥ 500 μm in depth), such as remarkable redness, uneven surface, margin elevation, ulceration, and enlarged folds[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>However, we could not anticipate the presence of deep submucosal invasion because none of these findings were revealed in our 6 GCED cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>The reason may be that there were few macroscopic changes in endoscopic morphology because the main submucosal invasive form of GCED depends on lymphatic and/or venous invasion and there were no severe stromal reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>In previous reports, AFPGC was usually associated with a poor prognosis with a high incidence of lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and synchronous and metachronous liver metastasis[23-25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Hirasaki et al[26] studied 24 cases of AFP-producing early gastric cancer and reported that liver metastasis was seen in 2 cases (8.3%) and lymph node metastasis was seen in 18 of 24 cases (75.0%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>From these results, they suggested that lymph node metastasis should be generally taken into consideration in AFP-producing early gastric cancer even if lymph node swelling is not seen on diagnostic imaging and that such patients should be under close periodic observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Adachi et al[23] studied 270 cases of AFPGC and reported that there were 61 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for stage I or II AFPGC, and that 39 of those patients (64%) were alive during a median follow-up period of 27 mo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is difficult to say that the prognosis was good. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Although in this study the mean diameters of GCED and CGC were about the same, comparisons of M and SM invasive cancer, positive rates of lymphatic and venous invasion, and non-curative resection rates were significantly higher in GCED than CGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when comparing only SM invasive cancer, the positive rate of venous invasion was significantly higher in GCED than CGC (100% vs 4.2%, P &lt; 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Although lymph node swelling cannot be seen on diagnostic imaging, lymph node metastasis occurred in 1 of 2 GCED cases who underwent additional surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>In addition, although all of the 4 GCED cases for whom we could follow their complete progress were alive during the median follow-up period of 40 mo, 5 of 6 GCED cases (83.3%; 4 of 4 SM invasive cancer, 100%) had endoscopic non-curative resection because of deep submucosal invasion, lymphatic and/or venous invasion, and a positive margin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we think that GCED, as well as AFPGC, may have a high incidence of liver and lymph node metastasis because of the high level of affinity to vessels and is associated with a poor prognosis in comparison with CGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In this study, 2 of 5 cases who had endoscopic non-curative resection were followed up without additional surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>One of the 5 cases had additional surgery and the remaining 2 were followed elsewhere. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Although the 2 cases that we are following are alive without a recurrence (case 2: 42 mo, case 5: 38 mo), it is thought that close periodic observation is strictly required in such cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The present study had some limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Since GCED is a disease with a very low incidence rate, the number of patients was small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data were collected retrospectively in a single medical center, which may produce selection bias. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, GCED is rare, but has distinct clinicopathological features, especially in terms of high malignant potential and difficulty in preoperative diagnosis by biopsy specimens and prediction of submucosal invasion by endoscopic findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>It is necessary for endoscopists and pathologists to be aware of the clinicopathological features of such a rare and highly malignant type of cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>In addition, when we detect specific histological findings for GCED with hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunohistochemical examination should be performed to make a precise diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no report that evaluated a large number of cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are needed to elucidate the natural history of GCED by assessing the long-term outcome and establishing optimal treatment approaches for GCED. </plain></SENT>
