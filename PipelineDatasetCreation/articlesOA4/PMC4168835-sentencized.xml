</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the world [1,2], is the leading cause of vision loss in the United States [3], and accounts for approximately 60% of Medicare costs related to vision [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Summary prevalence estimates indicate that 17.2% of Americans aged 40 years and older have cataract in either eye and 5.1% have pseudophakia or aphakia (previous cataract surgery). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition to the implications for healthcare delivery and healthcare costs, cataract has been shown to be associated with falls and increased mortality [5-12], possibly because of associated systemic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Women have a slightly higher risk of having cataract than men [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>With increased life expectancy, the number of cataract cases and cataract surgeries is expected to increase dramatically unless primary prevention strategies can be developed and successfully implemented. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Several genetic loci have also been linked to cataract as an independent phenotypic trait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>An extensive body of literature has addressed the role of genetics in childhood cataract [14], and it has been hypothesized that these same genes may be plausible candidates for age-related cataract [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that as many as 40 genes may be involved in age-related cataract [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Evidence for a major gene has been identified for cortical [17] and nuclear [18,19] cataract, with heritability estimates of 58% [20] and 48% [21], respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A whole genome STR scan conducted in families in Wisconsin revealed a major locus for age-related cortical cataract on chromosome 6p12-q12 [22], and specific candidate genes that have been studied include galactokinase (Gene_ID: 2584; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=604313">604313</ext-link>) [23,24], apolipoprotein E (Gene_ID: 348; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=107741">107741</ext-link>) [25], glutathione S-transferase (Gene_ID: 2944; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=138350">138350</ext-link>)[26], N-acetyltransferase 2 (Gene_ID: 10; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=612182">612182</ext-link>) [27,28], and estrogen metabolism genes [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Two recent studies found an association between the EPHA2 gene (Gene_ID: 1969; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=176946">176946</ext-link>) and cataract [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Higher body mass index (BMI) has been shown in many studies to increase risk of cortical and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5–2.5) [32-38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A recent study found that nuclear cataract was not associated with obesity but was associated with the FTO obesity gene (Gene_ID: 79068; OMIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/?term=610966">610966</ext-link>) in an Asian population [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although familial aggregation studies have shown a potential role for gene and environment interactions in nuclear cataract [40,41], research in this area is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The association of glutathione S-transferase with cataract has been shown to be modified by smoking [42] and sunlight exposure [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>No whole genome association SNP studies of age-related cataract in unrelated individuals have been reported in the medical literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for age-related cataract and to prioritize top hits for further follow-up. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)-funded electronic medical records and genomics (eMERGE) network implemented an electronic phenotype algorithm to select cataract cases and controls [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Cataracts as a condition were selected by Marshfield Clinic as its primary eMERGE phenotype, and the algorithm, which uses diagnostic and procedure codes, was developed by the Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) investigators [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The five sites in eMERGE-I include Marshfield Clinic, Group Health Research Institute, Vanderbilt University, Mayo Clinic, and Northwestern University. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This study included four of the sites: Marshfield Clinic, Group Health Research Institute, Vanderbilt University, and Mayo Clinic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Using an algorithm for a specific phenotype, each participating site extracted study samples for a specific disease or phenotype from the electronic health records (EHR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Once samples had been selected and genotyped, they were available for phenotyping with additional algorithms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cataract algorithm was deployed across the network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The cases and the controls had to meet the following inclusion criteria: The cases were age 50 years and older at the time of diagnosis or surgery, and the controls were age 50 years or older at the time of the most recent eye exam and had had an eye exam within the previous 5 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The controls had no diagnostic codes for cataract or evidence of cataract surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The cases were identified as “surgical” or “diagnosis only.” Surgical cases had undergone a cataract extraction in at least one eye. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis-only cases were required to have either cataract diagnoses on two or more dates or have one diagnosis date and natural language processing and optical character recognition (NLP/OCR) find one or more inclusion cataract terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Cataract type was extracted from the notes using natural language processing and optical character recognition with validation through manual chart abstraction [45,46]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Genotypic data </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide genotyping has been performed on approximately 17,000 samples across the network at the Broad Institute and at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) using the Illumina 660W-Quad or 1M-Duo Beadchips (CIDR, Baltimore, MD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For this particular study, which includes predominantly individuals of European descent, we used only the Illumina 660W-Quad platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This platform consists of 561,490 SNPs and 95,876 intensity-only probes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Genotyping calls were made at either CIDR or Broad using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com/gsp/genomestudio_software.ilmn">BeadStudio</ext-link> version 3.3.7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The eMERGE Cataract dataset pre-quality control (QC) included 7,535 DNA samples and 344 HapMap controls: 3,968 Marshfield Clinic, 2,379 Group Health, 986 Mayo, and 202 Vanderbilt BioVU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Data were cleaned using the eMERGE QC pipeline developed by the eMERGE Genomics Working Group [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This process includes evaluation of the sample and marker call rate, gender mismatch, duplicate and HapMap concordance, batch effects, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, sample relatedness, and population stratification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>After QC, 530,101 SNPs and 7,397 samples were used for analysis (see Table 1 for distribution by site). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>All genotype data and a detailed QC report for each individual site, as well as the merged eMERGE dataset, can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">dbGaP</ext-link>, and the detailed eMERGE QC pipeline can be found in [47,48]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1274" pm="."><plain>This study is the first genome-wide association study in age-related cataract reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1275" pm="."><plain>Cataract in type 2 diabetes has been investigated, and a region on chromosome 3p14.4–3p14.2 was identified in a Han Chinese population [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1276" pm="."><plain>The five SNPs identified in that study do not show evidence of association in our eMERGE cataract GWAS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1277" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to interpret these results, however, because age-related cataracts and cataracts in type 2 diabetics may be two different phenotypes, which may have disparate etiologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1278" pm="."><plain>In addition, our dataset does not have an overwhelming number of individuals with type 2 diabetes (see Table 1); thus, we were underpowered to explore this specific type of association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1279" pm="."><plain>Other previously published research on gene mapping in cataracts supports a linkage region on chromosome 1 [56] and association with EPHA2 [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1280" pm="."><plain>In our GWAS, we did not see evidence for association with EPHA2, although we did see association with EPHA4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1281" pm="."><plain>One significant difference in this study is the phenotyping of cases and controls based on electronic health records (EHR) in population-based cohorts, rather than family-based samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1282" pm="."><plain>However, our study in addition to the literature supports the suggestion of cataract-susceptibility loci on chromosome 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1283" pm="."><plain>Replication studies and larger sample sizes are needed to validate and confirm these findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1284" pm="."><plain>Although the eMERGE network has demonstrated the utility of electronic phenotyping in EHR for several traits [57-61], there are inherent challenges with this approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1285" pm="."><plain>For ophthalmic conditions specifically, the abundance of EHR coded information is extremely limited or, in some health systems, absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1286" pm="."><plain>Thus, sophisticated phenotyping strategies must be established [45,46] Still, the success of the EHR and biobank approach for association studies is unprecedented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1287" pm="."><plain>The ability to perform multiple GWAS simultaneously with no additional genotyping is an enormous benefit [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1288" pm="."><plain>Once a set of patient samples has been genotyped on a genome-wide association platform, those data can be reused for multiple additional genotype-phenotype association studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1289" pm="."><plain>In particular, the eMERGE network has done quite a bit of this for quantitative traits and clinical laboratory variables such as cholesterol [60], red-blood cell indices [59], and white blood cell count [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1290" pm="."><plain>The additional effort is expended on creating electronic phenotyping algorithms, rather than collecting samples and genotyping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1291" pm="."><plain>Thus, this is an enormous resource for subsequent genotype-phenotype association studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1292" pm="."><plain>Future explorations of age-related cataract include validating and replicating the association results identified herein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1293" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, because of the sample size and limited power by stratifying cases and controls by the eMERGE site, we did not have the opportunity to replicate these findings within eMERGE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1294" pm="."><plain>The goal is to identify a similar study population where these results can be explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1295" pm="."><plain>In addition, we are beginning to investigate the role of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions associated with cataracts [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1296" pm="."><plain>Due to the complexity of the trait, we hypothesize that the genetic architecture will be similar to that of other complex traits: multigenic with a combination of genetic and environmental interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1297" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated by this and other studies, the beauty of using an electronic health record is the ability to reuse genotyped samples for various phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
