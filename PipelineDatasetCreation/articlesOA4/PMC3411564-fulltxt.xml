The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, genotype distribution and epidemic history of HCV in the Gabonese general population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Principal Findings</title><p>A total of 4042 sera collected from adults in 220 villages in all nine administrative areas of the country were screened for antibodies to HCV. HCV NS5B region sequencing was performed for molecular characterization and population genetic analyses. Of 4042 tested sera, 455 (11.2%) were positive. The seroprevalence of HCV varied significantly by administrative area, with the highest rate in Ogoou&#x000e9;-Lolo province (20.4%) and the lowest in Ogoou&#x000e9;-Maritine province (3.7%). History of parenteral injections, past hospital admission and age over 55 years were independent risk factors for HCV infection (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Phylogenetic analyses showed that 91.9% of the strains were genotype 4 (HCV-4), 5.7% genotype 1 and 2.2% genotype 2. HCV-4 strains were highly heterogeneous, with more than eight subtypes; subtype 4e predominated (57.3%). Coalescence analyses indicated that subtype 4e was the oldest, with an estimated most recent common ancestor of 1702 [95% CI, 1418&#x02013;1884]. The epidemic profile indicated that it spread exponentially during the first part of the 20th century, probably by iatrogenic transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results confirm the endemicity of HCV subtype 4e in Gabon and show that its spread is due to a cohort effect, with previous, possibly iatrogenic events.

HCV infects about 170 million people worldwide (3% of the world&#x02019;s population) and is recognized as a major public health problem <xref rid="pone.0042002-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Like Egypt <xref rid="pone.0042002-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, Central Africa is considered a high-prevalence region, antibodies against HCV being detected in more than 6% of the population <xref rid="pone.0042002-Madhava1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The highest prevalences in these countries are typically observed in the oldest population groups <xref rid="pone.0042002-Cantaloube1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042002-Ppin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>HCV evolves very rapidly, resulting in high genetic diversity. It is classified into six genotypes, each subdivided into multiple subtypes <xref rid="pone.0042002-Simmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Some subtypes are found only in particular regions, while others are distributed globally. Genotype 1a is most commonly detected in Europe and the USA, while genotype 1b is distributed worldwide with high prevalences in Europe and the USA as well as in Japan. Genotype 2 originated from West and Central Africa and is common in Europe, Japan, and North America. Genotype 3 is most common in India, Indonesia and South-East Asia. Genotype 4 appears to be prevalent in Central Africa and the Middle East, while genotype 5 is most frequently reported in South Africa and genotype 6 in Hong Kong and South-East Asia <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pybus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The time of divergence of HCV genotypes circulating in those regions has been estimated: the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of genotypes 1 and 4 in Central Africa and of genotype 2 in West Africa was estimated to be 500&#x02013;600 years <xref rid="pone.0042002-Markov1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042002-Pouillot1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, whereas the age of the MRCA of genotype 6 in East Asia was dated to 1100&#x02013;1350 years <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pybus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, supporting the idea of long-term endemic transmission of HCV in these regions. Whereas circulation of most HCV subtypes remains restricted to geographical regions with long-term endemic transmission of the virus, a few HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, and 3a) are highly prevalent &#x02018;epidemic&#x02019; strains that have spread outside the endemic regions and are distributed globally <xref rid="pone.0042002-Simmonds2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. It has been estimated that epidemic subtypes 1a, 1b, and 3a emerged only about 100&#x02013;150 years ago and started to spread exponentially during the 20th century <xref rid="pone.0042002-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042002-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Recent emergence and expansion is fully consistent with the idea that worldwide dissemination of the epidemic HCV subtypes is mainly due to the emergence of new, efficient routes of viral transmission during the 20th century, such as blood transfusion, hemodialysis, injection drug use, and non-sterile medical injections <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pybus3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Hauri1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Tanaka2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In Gabon, the epidemiological picture is based on a few population-based surveys conducted since 1993. A seroprevalence of more than 6.5% was reported in Gabon <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Delaporte1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and the available sequences indicated a predominance of genotype 4 <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The only study on the genetic diversity of HCV NS5B sequences in Gabon showed that subtype 4e predominated in the 22 samples, and evolutionary analysis of the 4e sequences indicates a period of increased transmission during the early 20th century <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These population-based surveys have, however, been restricted to small towns and are not representative of the general population. As large-scale population-based studies are not available in Gabon, the results cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection, the genotype distribution or the burden of the disease in the general population.</p><p>We present here the results of a population-based study in all nine provinces of Gabon. The purpose of the study was to determine the seroprevalence of HCV in a stratified sample (by age and geographical area) of the general rural population and to establish the distribution of viral subtypes. The epidemic history of HCV was deduced by analysis of independent sequences in the NS5B region with new coalescence techniques <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pybus2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Area and Population</title><p>Gabon is located in central Africa, transversed by the equator; nearly 80% is covered by rain forest. The country has a surface area of 267 667 km<sup>2</sup> with about 1.5 million inhabitants (5.6 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>), 73% of whom live in urban areas. Administratively, Gabon is divided into nine provinces with 2048 villages located mainly along roads and rivers; few have more than 300 inhabitants. The main activities are subsistence farming, hunting, gathering and fishing. This study was conducted on blood samples collected between June 2005 and September 2008, during a project on Ebola virus in Gabon <xref rid="pone.0042002-Becquart1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, the survey covered 220 randomly selected villages in the nine administrative regions of Gabon (range, 10&#x02013;41 villages per province), most of which were rural with fewer than 300 inhabitants. The multidisciplinary team comprised a doctor from the Gabonese Ministry of Health, a nurse, an epidemiologist, a virologist and laboratory technicians, who made nine 1-month field missions to the study villages. All healthy volunteers over 15 years old who had been residing in the village for more than 1 year were eligible for the study.</p><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Gabonese Ministry of Health (Research authorization No. 00093/MSP/SG/SGAQM). The Health Director and the Governor of each province received written information, as did the traditional chief of each village. The planned studies were described orally to all participants, and individual written consent was obtained for blood sampling; parents&#x02019; written consent was obtained for participating children and minors. People who gave informed consent were interviewed on a structured epidemiological questionnaire covering history of blood transfusion, jaundice, mass treatment and mass vaccination, sharing toiletry items with other family members, suspected nosocomial transmission (surgical and dental procedures, hospitalizations) and suspected sporadic transmission (ritual scarring, ritual circumcision for men, ritual ear-piercing for women). A free medical examination and basic medicines were provided to all participants and non-participants. Blood smears for malaria diagnosis and field blood typing were also proposed.</p><p>Blood samples were usually collected in the village health care centers into 7-ml Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA (VWR International, France). The tubes were transported to the field laboratory for centrifugation (10 min, 2000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>) daily. Plasma and buffy coat were stored in aliquots at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until the end of the field mission and then transferred on dry ice to the Centre International de Recherches M&#x000e9;dicales de Franceville (CIRMF) and kept at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Each plasma sample was separated upon collection into two aliquots: one for serological testing and the other for molecular characterization.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Serological Test</title><p>The presence of antibodies to HCV was checked with a third-generation enzyme immunoassay (Monolisa anti-HCV plus version 2, Biorad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France). The reactivity of samples was determined as described previously <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom4" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Briefly, a ratio was calculated for each sample by dividing its optical density by the cut-off value. A sample was scored as positive if the ratio was &#x02265;6, whereas all samples with a ratio &#x0003c;6 were scored as negative.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>HCV Genotyping and Subtyping</title><p>HCV genotyping and subtyping were performed by amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a 382-nt fragment of the NS5B gene. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 140 &#x000b5;l of plasma from HCV-positive individuals with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The portion of HCV NS5B gene from extracted RNA was further amplified and sequenced as described previously <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pasquier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Briefly, RNA was subjected to hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, with Pr3 (5&#x02032;-TATGAYACCCGCTGYTTTGCTC-3&#x02032;) and Pr4 (5&#x02032;-GCNGARTAYCTVGTCATAGCCTC-3&#x02032;) as primers in the first step and Pr3 and Pr5 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCTAGTCATAGCCTCCGT-3&#x02032;</named-content>) in the second step. Combined reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was carried out on 10 &#x000b5;l of extracted RNA (reaction mixture volume, 50 &#x000b5;l) with the one-step RT-PCR kit (Superscript III) and 200 nM of each primer (Pr3, Pr4 and Pr5). The first step of RT-PCR with Pr3 and Pr4 was carried out at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min, then five cycles at 93&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 45 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, followed immediately by 35 cycles at 93&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 60&#x000b0;C with a drop of &#x02212;0.3&#x000b0;C between each cycle and elongation at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. The final elongation was at 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The second amplification step with Pr3 and Pr5 was carried out on 2 &#x000b5;l of the first PCR products at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, then 35 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s and a final elongation at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The amplified NS5B 382-bp product was analyzed by electrophoresis with a 2% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were purified on columns (Quick-Spin&#x02122; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced. PCR primers (Pr3 and Pr5) were used for sequencing both DNA strands. Cycle sequencing was undertaken by the fluorescent dye terminator technique (Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) with Ampli Taq&#x02122; DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoresis and data collection were done on an Applied Biosystems ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Sequence chromatograph files were analyzed with sequence analysis&#x02122; and sequence navigator&#x02122; software.</p><p>For phylogenetic analysis, NS5B nucleotide sequences were aligned initially by CLUSTAL_X 1.81 <xref rid="pone.0042002-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and subsequently adjusted by hand. The sequences were compared with reference sequences from the European HCV database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://euhcvdb.ibcp.fr/euHCVdb/">http://euhcvdb.ibcp.fr/euHCVdb/</ext-link>) and the Los Alamos database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hcv.lanl.gov/">http://hcv.lanl.gov/</ext-link>). Phylogenetic trees were estimated and assessed by the bootstrapping and neighbor-joining methods under the Kimura two-parameter substitution model, as implemented in MEGA version 5.0 <xref rid="pone.0042002-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Bootstrapping was performed with 1000 replicates.</p><p>In order to confirm the results obtained by NS5B genotyping and to identify probable recombinant HCV isolates, a 360-nucleotide fragment of the core gene was amplified as described previously <xref rid="pone.0042002-Simmonds3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> from a set of randomly selected samples. Briefly, RNA was subjected to a nested PCR amplification with CoreOS (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ACTGCCTGATAGGGTGCTTGCGAG-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and CoreOAS (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATGTACCCCATGAGGTCGGC-3&#x02032;</named-content>) as the primers in the first step and CoreIS (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AGGTCTCGTAGACCGTGCATCATG-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and CoreIAS (5&#x02032;-CAYGTRAGGGTATCGATGAC-3&#x02032;) in the second step. cDNA synthesis was first was carried out on 10 &#x000b5;l of extracted RNA (reaction mixture volume, 20 &#x000b5;l) with the RT kit (AMV-RT, Promega) and a random hexamer. The first step of PCR with CoreOS and CoreOAS and the second PCR with CoreIS and CoreIAS were carried out at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, then two cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, followed immediately by two of the same cycles with a drop of &#x02212;1&#x000b0;C at each hybridation cycle until 51&#x000b0;C and then 20 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 50&#x000b0;C for 30 s, with a final elongation at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. The amplified core 360-bp product was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products were purified and sequenced as described above. The PCR primers CoreIS and CoreIAS were used for sequencing both DNA strands.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Coalescent Analysis</title><p>The epidemic history of HCV subtypes 4e, 4f, 4c, 4t, and 4k, the prevalences of which represent at least 5% of circulating HCV isolates in Gabon, was investigated with a coalescent-based strategy.

Our phylogenetic analysis indicates the circulation of three HCV genotypes (1, 2 and 4), with a predominance of genotype 4. In a previous study in Gabon, only HCV genotype 4 was found <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The current study documents that there is high diversity in genotypes 1 and 4 and many unsubtyped sequences. We <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pasquier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and others <xref rid="pone.0042002-Ndjomou1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> have reported the circulation of three HCV genotypes (1, 2 and 4) in neighbouring Cameroon and Central African Republic, with greater genetic diversity within genotype 4. HCV genotype 4 also predominated and exhibited wide genetic diversity in previous studies in Gabon <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, nearby Cameroon <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pasquier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the Central African Republic <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the Republic of Congo <xref rid="pone.0042002-Cantaloube1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. An interesting finding is the difference in the predominant HCV-4 subtype in these four countries: subtype 4f in Cameroon <xref rid="pone.0042002-Pasquier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, subtype 4e in Gabon (<xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and this study), subtype 4k in the Central African Republic <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and 4c/4r in the Republic of Congo <xref rid="pone.0042002-Cantaloube1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These five HCV-4 subtypes thus represent the signature HCV infection in the corresponding country. Characterization of the full genomes of these subtypes is needed for correct classification and further studies.</p><p>Phylogenetic concordance was found in all 59 strains in which both the NS5B and core regions were sequenced. Unlike in some previous reports <xref rid="pone.0042002-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0042002-Noppornpanth1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, genotype/subtype recombinant sequences or dual genotype/subtype infection were not observed in this study, indicating that recombination is a rare event in HCV, as reported previously <xref rid="pone.0042002-Viazov1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042002-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>The epidemic history of HCV-4e, -4f, -4c, -4t and -4r strains was studied with a coalescent approach to population genetics. The MRCA of subtype 4e in this study is older than that reported by Ndong-Atome et al. <xref rid="pone.0042002-NdongAtome1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> in a remote village of Gabon. This suggests different epidemic histories of HCV-4e in Gabon, with different periods of introduction according to the administrative region. The MRCAs of subtypes 4f and 4c in this study are in the same range as that of Cameroon <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and the Republic of Congo <xref rid="pone.0042002-Cantaloube1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, suggesting a similar period of introduction. Interestingly, the MRCA of subtype 4k in this study is more recent than that reported by Njouom et al. <xref rid="pone.0042002-Njouom2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> in a village in the Central African Republic, suggesting that this subtype was introduced into Gabon from that country. The similarities in the population histories of HCV-4 in Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo, despite differences in the predominant subtype, suggest that medical interventions amplified the HCV-4 subtype, which was introduced into cohorts of patients during mass intravenous drug campaigns by mobile teams at health centers or in villages. Less common subtypes presumably correspond to those for which such amplification did not occur or which occurred only at the end of the era of massive administration of intravenous drugs, with fewer cycles of amplification.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that, like neighbouring Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of the Congo, Gabon has a high prevalence of HCV, especially among older people, and, moreover, that it is highly heterogeneic (ranging from 3.7% to 20.8%, depending on the area studied). Fourteen subtypes, including nine subtype 4 strains, were identified, suggesting that genotype 4, especially subtype 4e, which predominates, has been endemic for a long time in Gabon. Coalescence studies of subtypes 4e, 4f, and 4c with an epidemic profile indicate that they spread exponentially during the first part of the 20th century, probably due to iatrogenic transmission, as reported in previous studies. In contrast, the 4t and 4k populations did not reach growth equilibrium during this period and continue to spread. Further studies are required to identity the risk factors for transmission in the country.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Philippe Yaba, Andr&#x000e9; Delicat, Paul Ngari and Philippe Engandja for technical help.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0042002-Shepard1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
