<italic>Alteromonas</italic> species are globally distributed copiotrophic bacteria in marine habitats. Among these, sea-tidal flats are distinctive: undergoing seasonal temperature and oxygen-tension changes, plus periodic exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons. Strain SN2 of the genus <italic>Alteromonas</italic> was isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sea-tidal flat sediment and has been shown to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons there. Strain SN2's genomic features were analyzed bioinformatically and compared to those of <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> ecotypes: AltDE and ATCC 27126. Strain SN2's genome differs from that of the other two strains in: size, average nucleotide identity value, tRNA genes, noncoding RNAs, dioxygenase gene content, signal transduction genes, and the degree to which genes collected during the Global Ocean Sampling project are represented. Patterns in genetic characteristics (e.g., GC content, GC skew, Karlin signature, CRISPR gene homology) indicate that strain SN2's genome architecture has been altered via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Experiments proved that strain SN2 was far more cold tolerant, especially at 5&#x000b0;C, than the other two strains. Consistent with the HGT hypothesis, a total of 15 genomic islands in strain SN2 likely confer ecological fitness traits (especially membrane transport, aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis) specific to the adaptation of strain SN2 to its seasonally cold sea-tidal flat habitat.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genus <italic>Alteromonas</italic>, established by Baumann <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0035784-Baumann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Baumann2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, accommodates Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped bacteria living in marine habitats.

Previous studies also have shown that members of the genus <italic>Alteromonas</italic> may dominate heterotrophic blooms; thus, this genus has been generally described as having a copiotrophic way of life as an <italic>r</italic>-strategist <xref rid="pone.0035784-LpezLpez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-McCarren1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>; they can grow rapidly when organic nutrients are available in the marine setting.</p><p>The coasts of the Yellow Sea on the Korean peninsula consist of vast tidal flats, which are known as &#x0201c;getbol&#x0201d; in Korea. It is well known that sea-tidal flats are rich in valuable biological resources (including marine animals) that play very important roles in the restoration and stabilization of coastal ecosystems and nutrient cycling <xref rid="pone.0035784-Winberg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Stevens2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Sea-tidal flats are coastal marshes or muddy areas that undergo flooding with seawater and exposure to the atmosphere between low and high tides <xref rid="pone.0035784-Sohma1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Petroleum hydrocarbon releases into the marine environment occur broadly <xref rid="pone.0035784-Webler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; in fact, in 2007 the oil tanker MV Hebei Spirit released an estimated 12,547,000 liters (10,900 M/T) of crude oil to tidal flats along the Taean coast of the Yellow Sea in South Korea <xref rid="pone.0035784-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. During the winter season, microbial communities in sea-tidal flats experience very low temperature (&#x0003c;0&#x000b0;C) especially low tide; while in summer, the sea-tidal flat microorganisms confront the challenge of higher temperature (&#x0003e;30&#x000b0;C). Obviously then, sea-tidal flat habitats present selective pressures for native marine microorganisms (temperature, fluctuations in oxygen tension and organic compounds; Kim et al. <xref rid="pone.0035784-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>) that differ considerably from those of the open ocean.</p><p>Previously published reports have suggested that many <italic>Alteromonas</italic>-related bacteria likely play important roles in PAH degradation in marine habitats <xref rid="pone.0035784-Zaidi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Zaidi2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our previous studies also showed that members of <italic>Alteromonas</italic> were responsible for the <italic>in situ</italic> biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in crude oil-contaminated sea-tidal flat sediment <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Recently, <italic>Alteromonas</italic> sp. strain SN2 (KACC 91504P) was isolated and its genome was sequenced <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Here, we present an analysis of the whole genome sequence of strain SN2 and compare it with the genomes of two <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> strains representing distinctive ecotypes: surface waters in the Pacific Ocean and deep waters of the Adriatic Sea <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We also examine the SN2 genome for special features such as genomic islands, codon usage, membrane transport, signal transduction genes, tRNA diversity, recombination, carbon metabolism, and aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation&#x02013;all of which reveal ecological fitness traits associated with microbial survival strategies (especially cold adaptation) that are relevant to sea-tidal flat sediments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sampling site and bacterial strains</title><p>
<italic>Alteromonas</italic> sp. SN2 (KACC 91504P) was isolated from a sea-tidal flat sediment gathered from the Taean coastal area (36&#x000b0;48&#x02032; 50&#x02033;N 126&#x000b0;11&#x02032;9&#x02033;E), Republic of Korea, on December 29, 2007, 22 days after an oil spill accident <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. At the sampling time, the characteristics of the sampling site were as follows: temperature of the sampling site, 2.0&#x000b0;C; temperature of seawater, 6.7&#x000b0;C; salinity of seawater: 32.05&#x02030;; and dissolved oxygen of seawater: 10.9 mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In the previous report, the entire genomic sequence of strain SN2 was determined <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In brief, a draft of assembly with the pyrosequencing data at 130&#x000d7;coverage was first generated and all intrascaffold and interscaffold gaps were closed by primer walking and PCR segment sequencing. The final whole-genome sequence was further validated by the Illumina sequencing data (about 150&#x000d7;coverage) and thirty-seven ambiguous regions were finally confirmed by Sanger sequencing <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>Alteromonas</italic> sp.

Strain SN2 has a larger genome (4.97 Mb) than the two other <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains, AltDE (4.41 Mb) and ATCC 27126 (4.61 Mb). The average gene length of strain SN2 was relatively longer than those of the other two <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains because the number of protein coding genes in strain SN2 did not exceed that of strain ATCC 27126, and the DNA coding density of strain SN2 (87.99&#x00025;) was similar to that of strains AltDE (86.65&#x00025;) and ATCC 27126 (86.76&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t001">Table 1</xref>). The genome of strain SN2 encodes 4,355 candidate protein coding genes, of which 3089 (70.93&#x00025;) proteins were assigned to the cluster of orthologous groups of proteins (COG), similar to the values for strains AltDE (70.33&#x00025;) and ATCC 27126 (71.29&#x00025;).</p><p>Comparative average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis with all sequenced bacterial genomes in the IMG database revealed that the genome of strain SN2 is most closely related to strains ATCC 21726 and AltDE.

Therefore, we applied established criteria (minimum percent identity of nucleotides, 50&#x00025;; coverage, 70&#x00025;) to identify common and strain-specific genes among the three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The three genomes shared 2479 core protein coding genes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figure 2(a)</xref>]. Strains AltDE and ATCC 27126 shared more genes with each other than with strain SN2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figure 2(a)</xref>]. This implies that the SN2 genome contains a greater proportion of strain-specific genes than the other two genomes&#x02013; likely encoding specialized physiological properties. Although a COG analysis comparison using the total pool of genes reinforced commonalities among the three genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figure 2b</xref>), contrasts found using strain-specific genes appeared more evident, especially in the COG categories of energy production and conversion (C), carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G), and replication, recombination and repair (L) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figures 2(c)</xref> and 2(d)].</p><p>Genes from the categories of greatest contrast in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g002">Figures 2(c)</xref> and 2(d) were subjected to additional scrutiny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>). Strain SN2's genome contains 66 transposase and IS elements belonging to 16 families; this abundance of mobile genetic element-related genes is similar to that of the genome of strain AltDE (65) but is much higher than that of the genome of strain ATCC 27126 (3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>). Regarding another type of mobile genetic element, the genomes of strain SN2 and ATCC 27126 both contain a relatively low number (13 and 12, respectively) of phage integrase genes, compared to that of the AltDE genome (32). The current literature exhibits conflicting trends regarding the influence of ocean-water depth on the abundance of mobile genetic elements. Reports indicate that metagenomic DNA from surface seawater can contain fewer phage integrases than that of deep (4000 m) seawater <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035784-Konstantinidis2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. On the other hand, DeLong et al. <xref rid="pone.0035784-DeLong1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> observed that phage genes were enriched in the photic zones having high productivity. We feel the trends of phage genes found within our three compared genomes reflect a combination of both water depth and the sediment matrix. We speculate that microorganisms living in sea-tidal-flat sediment experience cell-cell interactions at relatively high frequency (leading to lateral gene transfer) due to relatively high cell densities associated with particulate surfaces <xref rid="pone.0035784-Konstantinidis2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. By contrast, exposure in sediment to attack by phage parasites may be relatively infrequent due to adsorptive inactivation of the phage by particle surfaces <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Strain SN2 harbors more dioxygenase genes than the other two <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains AltDE and ATCC 27126 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>), indicating that strain SN2 has a higher degradation potential for recalcitrant organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, TonB receptors, which are related to the transport or utilization of various substrates, are not as prevalent in strain SN2 as they are in ATCC 27126. Similarly, there are comparatively fewer ABC transporter genes in strain SN2 than in the other two strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>), which contrasts with a previous report that prokaryotic species with larger genome may contain more ABC transporter genes <xref rid="pone.0035784-Konstantinidis3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Both trends in transport-related genes may reflect the likelihood that carbon flow in sea-tidal flat habitats may be proportionately less reliant on photosynthesis than is surface seawater and less reliant on organic particulates (e.g., marine snow) than are deep sea areas. Strain SN2 contains fewer heavy metal resistance-related genes and toxin-antitoxin systems. Phenotypically, however, our recent experimental results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035784.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035784.s005">Table S1</xref>) showed that resistance by strain SN2 to heavy metals (zinc and mercury; also antibiotics) was similar to that of strain AltDE <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Genes that enable export of drugs or toxins are commonly found in Gram-negative bacteria. The ability of these three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains to tolerate exposure to metals and antibiotics may be facilitated by their substantial content (SN2, 51; AltDE, 50; ATCC 27126, 45) of Acr system-related genes.</p><p>Although most genes in strains SN2 and AltDE matched significantly, the complex patterns exhibited in the chromosomal synteny dot-blot revealed that numerous genomic translocation, inversion, and insertion have occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g003">Figure 3</xref>; the dot-blot plot between strains SN2 and ATCC 27126 was not shown due to the incomplete genome sequence of strain ATCC 27126); such rearrangements may have been mediated by strain SN2's mobile genetic elements (transposases, IS elements, phage integrases; see above and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>). A global genomic comparison using the Mauve program also confirmed the extensive genome-wide rearrangements in strain SN2 relative to strain AltDE, especially in the form of reciprocal inversions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035784.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, deviations from mean values in Karlin signature skew, cumulative GC skew, and tetranucleotide frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g003">Figure 3</xref>) show significant correlation; thereby providing additional evidence for structural rearrangements in strain SN2's genome. Interestingly, the cumulative GC skew in the genome of strain SN2 showed asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g003">Figure 3</xref>); this is fully consistent with the above-suggested recent genetic acquisitions and rearrangements <xref rid="pone.0035784-Eppinger1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Fifteen genomic islands were detected across the SN2 chromosome; these are discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Testing temperature adaptation among three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> genomes using gene-fragment recruitment analysis of the GOS database</title><p>Gene-fragment &#x0201c;recruitment analysis&#x0201d; has recently proven to be an effective tool for assessing the degree of representation of reference genomes in environmental metagenomic sequence reads.

Particularly germane to the present investigation prior to carrying out recruitment analyses, Ivars-Martinez et al. <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> sorted subsets from the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) data sets [30,31) according to location of origin and both habitat type (e.g., coastal, estuary, open ocean) and water temperature; this strategy showed that the strain ATCC 27126 genome was highly represented in metagenomes from estuaries and in metagenomes derived from waters &#x0003e;20&#x000b0;C, relative to the AltDE genome. Here we also utilized recruitment analysis to examine the influence of temperature on the degree of representation of each of the three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> genomes. We sorted the GOS database into 82 subsets spanning temperatures from 2 to 37 &#x000b0;C; the majority of the subsets (gathered from depths of 1 to 30 m) were warm surface waters (25 to 29&#x000b0;C). Results of this &#x0201c;recruitment versus water temperature&#x0201d; analysis appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g004">Figure 4(a)</xref>, which plots habitat temperature against normalized best-hit values for each of the three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> genomes (a BLASTN cutoff of 50&#x00025; nucleotide identity was utilized; 70&#x00025; of the length of the query sequence; best hit numbers were normalized according to database sizes). The recruitment analysis showed that the strain SN2 genome recruited slightly more GOS database genes from seawater samples with low temperature, and vice versa for strain ATCC 27126 although strains SN2 and ATCC 27126 genomes had no significant correlations for source seawater temperature [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g004">Figure 4(a)</xref>]. A subsequent PCA plot revealed clearer correlations between the seawater temperatures of GOS databases and the normalized best-hit values. In the recruitment analysis of the strain ATCC 27126 genome, the variability represented by PCA factor 1 had a clear positive correlation for the variability represented by factor 2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g004">Figure 4(b)</xref>]. However, in the strain SN2 genome, the two variabilities had negative correlations, which were stronger than those of the strain AltDE genome. Overall, the PCA-analysis showed that the temperature-sorted recruitment trends were distinct for each of the <italic>Alteromonas</italic> genomes. Thus, we conclude that strain SN2 is adapted to grow at low temperature (relative to strains AltDE and ATCC 27126).

The sea-tidal flat where strain SN2 was isolated features highly dynamic environmental conditions: coastal waters ebb and flow on lunar cycles, while there are large annual temperature fluctuations (&#x02212;5&#x000b0;C to 35&#x000b0;C; <xref rid="pone.0035784-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). By contrast, the seawater habitats where <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> &#x0201c;deep ecotype&#x0201d; (AltDE) and <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> ATCC 27126 were isolated have relatively constant temperatures. AltDE is from the 1,000-m depth of the Adriatic Sea (12.5&#x000b0;C; <xref rid="pone.0035784-IvarsMartinez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) and strain ATCC 27126 is from surface seawater off the coast of Oahu (Hawaii), whose annual variation is &#x0223c;24 to 28&#x000b0;C. Because of the radically different temperature regimes in the habitats from which the three strains were isolated, we hypothesized their physiologies would reflect this selective influence. Growth (OD) by all three strains was monitored in marine broth at eight different temperatures (5 to 40&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035784-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Strain SN2 clearly grew well at low temperatures&#x02013; reaching high cell density at 5&#x000b0;C within 14 days, while strains AltDE and ATCC 27126 showed no appreciable growth.

The strain SN2 genome contains 24 genes encoding GGDEF domain-containing proteins, 15 genes encoding diguanylate cyclases, and 48 histidine kinase genes; these match or exceed the corresponding abundances of these two gene categories for the other two strains. Furthermore, strain SN2's genome contains more sigma factor coding genes than those of two other <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0035784-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that strain SN2 may respond more rapidly to cellular or environmental signals such as temperature fluctuations of the sea-tidal flat. The trend is clear: sea-tidal-flat bacterium strain SN2 harbors more genes specific to signal transduction systems than do its open-ocean-dwelling relatives (strains AltDE and ATCC 27126), suggesting that signal-transduction genes may play proportionately larger roles in the adaptation of strain SN2 to sea-tidal sediment conditions, perhaps fostering surface-attachment by cells to sediment particles.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>tRNAs and non-coding RNAs</title><p>The total tRNA gene content in bacteria, especially psychrophilic ones, can contribute to maximum potential growth rates&#x02013; because high numbers of tRNA genes can compensate for a slow diffusion rates during biosynthetic reactions at low temperatures <xref rid="pone.0035784-Lng1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

Meanwhile, the PP pathway can produce a variety crucial metabolic precursors for nucleic acids, aromatic amino acids and NADPH for biosynthesis and several catalytic reactions <xref rid="pone.0035784-Yagi1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. All genes required for the PP pathway are present in all three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains, and all three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains harbor one copy of the gene encoding ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase, which converts ribulose-5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate. However, only strain SN2 shows broader potential metabolic versatility by harboring, in addition, two copies of the ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase gene. Two genes for the glyoxylate pathway within the citric acid cycle, isocitrate lyase (AMB_00007460) and malate synthase (AMB_00007440), are present in all three <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains. It is well established that many bacteria accumulate glycogen storage bodies during periods of high carbon source availability <xref rid="pone.0035784-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.

By contrast, the naphthalene catabolic genes of strain SN2 are scattered broadly and are distributed between two clusters across a 33 kbp section of GI-11. Moreover, three regulatory genes (two LysR-type regulators, AMB_00036020; AMB_00036030; one GntR-type regulator, AMB_00035900) are associated with the PAH genes in strain SN2. The presence of additional regulatory genes may be physiologically advantageous to strain SN2; it has been suggested that refined gene regulatory mechanisms allow cells to adjust their metabolism within a challenging range of conditions. The fluctuating conditions such as sporadic input of hydrocarbon contaminants and seasonal temperature change that prevail in strain SN2's sea-tidal-flat habitat may have selected for an increase in gene copy number or alterations in the associated regulatory system <xref rid="pone.0035784-Gevers1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, the naphthalene metabolic pathway carried by strain SN2 likely converts naphthalene to salicylate, then gentisate, and finally fumarate and pyruvate via the gentisate pathway. The PAH degradation capabilities of strain SN2 have been confirmed experimentally; strain SN2 is able to degrade naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene <xref rid="pone.0035784-Jin2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The absence of napthalene-catabolic genes in the other two <italic>Alteromonas</italic> strains and the presence of transposases at the two ends of the PAH-degrading gene cluster in GI-11 are fully consistent with acquisition in strain SN2 via horizontal gene transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Oxidative stress tolerance</title><p>Mechanisms to combat oxidative stress are required in all microorganisms that carry out aerobic respiration, as well as those that express dioxygenase-type enzymes (discussed above) used in PAH metabolism.
