</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a large superfamily of integral membrane conserved proteins present in animals, plants, and microorganisms (Nebert and Russell, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CYP isoenzyme superfamily comprises 57 CYP genes and 58 pseudogenes arranged into 18 families and 43 subfamilies in man (Nelson et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They are heme-containing proteins that catalyze the oxidative metabolism of many structurally diverse drugs and chemicals (Woo et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reduced cytochrome P450 isoenzymes when bound to CO has a Soret peak at 450 nm (Luthra et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This peak is not usual for a hem containing protein molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hence, they are called P450 (Luthra et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In mammals, the CYPs system is expressed in all tissues examined (Porter and Coon, 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They are expressed predominately in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as well as in other cellular compartments such as the cell surface and in mitochondria (Neve and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The cytochrome P450 superfamily is located primarily in liver, small intestine and kidney (Thelen and Dressman, 2009; Renaud et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CYPs P450 enzymes catalyze different oxidation and some reduction reactions (Guengerich, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Examples of the substrates (Porter and Coon, 1991; Chang and Kam, 1999) of CYPs include exogenous (xenobiotics) and endogenous compounds such as cholesterol, testosterone, progesterone, prostagalandin H2, corticosterone, retinoic acid, vitamin D3 and arachidonic acid (Guengerich, 2017). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CYPs are grouped into families and subfamilies according to the similarity of amino acid sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The enzyme code is started with the CYP followed by a designating number for the family (Petersson, 2009; Sim and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2010; Sim and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Then, a letter for the subfamily and ending with an individual number for the gene (Petersson, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>If the CYPs enzymes share more than 40 % identity in amino acid sequence they will be group in the same family, for example (CYP2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>If the identity is more than 55%, the CYP enzymes belong to the same subfamily for example CYP2A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Then the CYP enzyme will be given an individual number, for example CYP2A6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>An up to date list of CYP is found on a CYP 450 homepage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/index_original">https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/index_original</ext-link>) (Sim and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2010; Sim and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>All CYP enzymes share a conserved general three dimensional structure that resembles a shape of an inverted triangle (Petersson, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The CYP enzyme consists of a protein moiety and a heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) as prosthetic group of the enzyme (Ortiz de Montellano, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>They are involved in the metabolism of the lipophilic endogenous and xenobiotic compounds transform them to hydrophilic or polar compounds such that they can be easily excreted from the body (Chang and Kam, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The biotransformation reactions are divided into two phases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The CYPs catalyze the phase 1 reactions (Sim and Ingelman-Sundberg, 2013), which are oxidation or demethylation (Iyanagi, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The substrate binds the catalytic pocket of the CYP enzyme that contains heme iron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The heme iron is then reduced from the ferric to the ferrous state by an electron transferred from a reduced NADPH (Chang and Kam, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The molecular oxygen then binds temporarily at heme containing active site (Zanger and Schwab, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, one oxygen atom is inserted in the substrate molecule and the other atom is reduced to form H2O. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The reaction for the monooxygenation can be represented in the formula: RH + NAD (P) H + O2 + H+ -&gt; ROH + NAD (P) + H2O. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Where, RH is the substrate containing a hydroxylatable site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>CYP enzymes therefore belong to the enzymes class of monooxygenase that only incorporates one atom of the molecular oxygen into their substrates (Ortiz de Montellano, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The major functions of CYPs are the metabolism of the foreign compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For instance, they catalyze the hydroxylation of the drugs barbiturate and the phenobarbital (Zanger and Schwab, 2013) to increase their hydrophilicity such that they can be eliminated via the kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Other examples of drugs that are metabolized by the oxidation catalyzed by CYPs are the ibuprofen and the caffeine (Zanger and Schwab, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Therefore, duration of action of many drugs depends on their rate of metabolism by the CYPs enzymes (Fernandez et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)° are wide spreading environmental procarcinogens that inducetumorigenesis when they are activated by CYPs 450 and other enzymes such as epoxide hydrolase, and aldoketoreductase (Shimada et al., 2008; Moorthy et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The PAHs activation results in the formation of the reactive and redox-active o-quinones, diolepoxides, or radical cations (Moorthy et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>All of these compounds react with the DNA and forming DNA adducts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The DNA adducts eventually lead to the mutation and initiation of the carcinogenesis (Moorthy et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>For instance, it has been reported that CYP1B1 that is found in pulmonary and other tissues (except for liver) has a pivotal role in the metabolic activation of the PAHs (Shimada and Fujii-Kuriyama, 2004; Chun and Kim, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The PAHs that are metabolically activated by the CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 are the Benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a]pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 5-methylchrysene (Shimada et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) forms was shown to be expressed consistently in kidney cancer cells using the immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, and reverse transcriptase PCR (Murray et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This study has suggested that the expressed CYP3A may be involved in renal cancer development (Murray et al., 1999), and that these forms of CYP3A are the cause of the multidrug resistance observed in this cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they proposed that the presence CYP3A forms in the renal cells is of benefit for the treatment of renal cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>For instance, the agent AQ4N, an alkylaminoanthroquinone is bioactivated by CYP3A forms to a highly cytotoxic metabolite in the hypoxic conditions of the tumor cells, but the AQ4N would not be cytotoxic for the normal cells where the conditions are normoxic (Murray et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The cytochrome CYP1B1 was also shown to be present in renal cell carcinoma (McFadyen et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>It is also expressed in wide variety of cancers and not detected in normal cells (Murray et al., 1997; McFadyen et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that since CYP1B1 is the metabolizing enzyme for the anticancer drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) its inhibition may be a good strategy for cancer therapy (McFadyen et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been suggested CYP1B1 is significantly unregulated in renal cell carcinoma, and that it promotes this cancer progression (Mitsui et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This study has demonstrated that in renal cell carcinoma cell line attenuating the expression of the CYP1B1 gene results in inhibition of the cancer cell viability, migration, and invasiveness (Mitsui et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Mitsui et al., (2015) have reported that the expression of the CYP1B1 is positively correlates with the expression of the cell division cycle 20 homolog (CDC20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The CDC20 is an essential factor that drives mitotic phase through activation of anaphase-promoting complex /cyclosome (APC/C) that triggers the transition from metaphase to anaphase (Izawa and Pines, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In addition, Mitsui et al (2015) have suggested that the CYP1B1 promotes renal cell cancer through down regulation of the death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>DAPK1 is a tumor suppressor gene and its expression is down regulated in many types of carcinoma (Chuang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CYP2E1 contribute to the generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in breast cancer cells (Leung et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In addition, CYP2E1 regulates autophagy, stimulate stress of endoplasmic reticulum and suppress metastatic potential of the BC cells (Leung et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The expression of the CYP2E1 was shown to increase significantly in BC cells as well as the tissues that are adjacent to the tumor (Vaclavikova et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of the CYP2E1 enzyme might be beneficial for the cancer patient (Vaclavikova et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This benefit comes from CYP2E1 prodrugs activation property and that the metabolism of some substrates of CYP2E1 leads to the production of ROS and oxidative stress (Gonzalez, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This eventually lead to the inhibition of the apoptosis but the necrotic cancer cell death will be accelerated (Gonzalez, 2005; Vaclavikova et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In a study aimed to examine the expression profile of CYP450 enzymes in (BC) in Caucasian population (Murray et al., 2010), it has been reported that there are upregulations of the CYP4X1, CYP2S1 and CYP2U1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CYP1B1, CYP3A5 and CYP51 displayed significant correlations with cancer grade (Murray et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>CYP2S1 is involved in metabolism of important exogenous and endogenous substrates, for example, the retinoic acid that is a metabolite of vitamin A (Madanayake et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>CYP2S1 may also be involved in activation or deactivation of procarcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The expression of CYP2S1 is comparable to that of the CYP1B1 (Rivera et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In addition to tumors, the expression of CYP2S1 is also increased in myocardial infarction, lung hypertension, renal failure and rheumatoid arthritis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>This increased expression probably influences the response of these pathological conditions to the treating drugs that are substrate of CYP2S1 (Rivera et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Other study has reported that the CYP3A is not expressed in Japanese BC patients and that CYP3A expression in BC population may be of ethnic dependent (Oyama et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Studying the expression of CYP3A in BC is of special interest since the tamoxifen is metabolized by CYP3A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of tamoxifen treatment is influenced by variation in CYP3A expression (Oyama et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The highest expression quantified by PCR was in the nasal mucosa, trachea, and lung tissues (Su et al., 2000; Sun and Fan, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>CYP2A13 catalyzes the metabolic activation of the major tobacco-specific carcinogen, the 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NMK) through alpha hydroxylation (Su et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that there is down-regulation of CYP2A13 expression in adenocarcinoma and suggested that CYP2A13 is implicated in the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma (Sun and Fan, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that there is association between estrogen metabolism and cigarette smoking and there is growing evidences proposing that estrogen levels is elevated in lung cancer (Chakraborty et al., 2010; Slowikowski et al; 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>CYP1B1 is induced by tobacco (Port et al., 2004), and can convert the tobacco procarcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) to carcinogenic intermediates (Port et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Estrogen also is metabolized with CYP1B1 (Samavat and Kurzer, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In lung tissues during the metabolism of the estradiol and the tobacco specific carcinogens by CYP1B1, DNA adducts and ROS can form which may cause DNA damage which can be mutagenic (Slowikowski et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that there are lower expressions of CYP1B1 in non-small cell lung cancer at both mRNA and protein levels in the middle stage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) irrespective of the age, gender or the histopathological type of lung cancer (Slowikowski et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>CYP1B1 has been shown to be overexpressed in PC cells and this overexpression is caused by hypomethylation of promoter/enhancer of the CYP1B1 gene (Tokizane et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that CYP1B1 is implicated in prostate carcinogenesis by its ability to activate metabolic carcinogens, as there is association between exposure to PAHs and increased risk to PC (Tokizane et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>CYP1A1 is involved in metabolism of estrogen and can activate procarcinogens (He and Feng, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CYP1A1 polymorphism is associated with PC development (Ding et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In a study conducted in Indian cohort reported that CYP1A1 gene polymorphism that leads to Ile462Val change was associated with a reduced PC risk, while polymorphism T3801C at 3’UTR of CYP1A1 gene was associated with increased PC risk (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been suggested that CYP27B1 controls the normal growth of prostate cells through its role in vitamin D metabolism (Chen et al., 2012), and that CYP27B1 is regulated by epidermal growth factor (Chen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>CYP27B1 has anti-tumor activity and when desregulated by epidermal growth factor the PC develops (Chen, 2008; Chen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that CYP2E1 is overexpressed in alcohol-induced liver damage as well as non-alcoholic steatosis (Niemela et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Diabetes is commonly associated with fat mobilization as it will be the first energy source which will lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Hazlehurst et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The reduced activity and decreased expression of CYP 3A4 as in DM would influence the diabetic patients in respect to the biotransformation of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Moreover, downregulated CYP3A4 would probably decrease the oxidation of testosterone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This would reduce the amount of the biologically active form of dihydrotestosterone that is required for the normal growth of the prostate gland (Dostalek et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The reduced CYP3A4 activity and protein level in diabetic patients may be because of obesity, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-γ) (Sunman et al., 2004; Dostalek et al., 2011), noncytokine components and oxidative stress (Dostalek et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In an experiment conducted in T2D nonobese Goto–Kakizaki rats (Oh et al., 2012), it has been shown that hepatic expression of CYP3A2 was increased, whereas, CYP1A2 and CYP3A1 expression was reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In another experiment conducted in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley male rats (Sindhu et al., 2006), it has been reported that the of CYP1B1, CYP2B1, CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 is upregulated in diabetic rats, in contrast to CYP2C11 that was decreased to more than 90% in the diabetic rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Both of the above studies indicated that in diabetes, the CYP expression is in an isoform-specific manner and that this altered expression can partially be treated with insulin (Sindhu et al., 2006, Oh et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported that metformin decreases the expression of CYP1B1 by down regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in breast cancer cells (Do et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Arachidonic acid is metabolized by the CYP450 (CYP 2B, 2C8, 2C9, 2C10, 2J2) or arachidonic acid epoxygenase to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The EETs act as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) that functions as vasodilator in all vasculatures including the coronary arteries (Chawengsub et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>It has been shown in cultured human endothelial cells and native porcine coronary artery endothelial cells that the EDHF metabolite of arachidonic acid by CYP2C is the most vital cause of endothelium relaxation (Fisslthaler et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Other relaxing factors include prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide (NO) (Chawengsub et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>These CYP450 enzymes therefore prevent or regress the atherosclerosis (Luoma, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also generated by CYP2C catalytic reactions (particularly by CYP2C9) in coronary artery endothelial cells (Fleming et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>When the CYP2C is over produced, it will generate more ROS (Ercan et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The deleterious effects of the ROS include the inhibition of the relaxation mediated by the NO and the elevated activity of the redox-sensitive transcription factor (NF-κB) (Fleming et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The NF-κB pathway plays important roles in the development of metabolic disease such as atherosclerosis and T2D (Baker et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>NF-κB pathway contributes to the inflammatory response by the production of cytokines, recruitment of WBCs, differentiation of immune cells, and survival of the cells for example the macrophage foam cells, whose necrosis initiated the atherosclerotic plaques (Baker et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ROS enhances the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule1 (VCAM-1) (Fleming et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The role of VCAM-1 in the inflammatory response and atherosclerosis is well established (Skeoch et al., 2014, Denys et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CYP1B1 has been shown to promote the generation of ROS and contribute to the development of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E–deficient mice fed atherogenic diet (Song et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the CYP1B1 inhibitors such as 2,3’,4,5’-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) can be used for treatment of atherosclerosis (Song et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>CYP7A1 plays a protective role against atherosclerosis (Li et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>CYP7A1 (also known as cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase) catalyzes the committed step in cholesterol and bile acids synthesis in hepatocytes (Li et al., 2011), and is critical for their homeostasis (Li et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>CYP7A1 maintains this homeostasis by enhancing formation of bile acids from cholesterol, and increases free cholesterol secreted in bile without increasing cholesterol reabsorption by intestinal cells (Li et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In man, a frame shift mutation in CYP7A1 gene (L413fsX414) that lead to enzyme loss of function would result in hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary and peripheral vascular disease (Pullinger et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown in mice that the overexpression of CYP7A1 attenuates atherosclerosis by increasing secretion of bile, decreasing serum LDL-C, and decreasing acculturation of visceral fat deposits (Krishnamurthy et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>CYP4A11 also exerts anti- atherosclerosis effect and metabolize arachidonic acid into the vasoactive 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) (Fu et al., 2013; White et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>SNP in the promoter of CYP4A11 (rs9332978 T&gt;C) has been reported to be associated with coronary artery disease in females of Russian cohort (Sirotina et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This study proposed that the estradiol inhibits expression of CYP4A11 in the carriers of CC genotype which would result in reduced production of the vasoactive 20-HETE (Sirotina et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Other polymorphism in CYP4A11gene is (T8590C) polymorphism which reduces its catalytic activity (White et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism was associated with a reduced HDL-C level and elevated C-reactive protein concentration in females (White et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that CYP4A11with reduced activity would lead to decreased synthesis of ω-hydroxylated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids which is an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) (White et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>PPAR α is modulated by estrogen, and its agonist reduces the blood lipids, increases HDL-C and exert anti-inflammatory effect (Cuzzocrea et al., 2006; Nissen et al., 2007; White et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>CYP2C9 is the second main CYP expressed in hepatocytes, whereas the CYP3A4 is most expressed CYP in liver cells (Van Booven et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>The CYP2C9 is the drug-metabolizing enzyme for about 15-20% of all drugs undergoing phase I metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>For instance, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, oral anticoagulants, and oral hypoglycemic (Rettie and Jones, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that CYP2C9 is induced by treatment with rifampicin (Van Booven et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The metabolic rates of P450 2C9 substrates for examples the phenytoin, tolbutamide, S-warfarin, losartan are increased to about two times in patients treated with rifampicin (Kanebratt et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of the CYP2C9 include amiodarone, fluconazole, and sulphaphenazole (Miners and Birkett, 1998; Van Booven et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of the human CYP2C9 unliganded and bound to the anti-coagulant drug warfarin has been elucidated (Williams et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID: 1OG2 and 1OG5) revealed a novel binding pocket in CYP2C9 and unexpected interactions between the CYP2C9 and the drug Warfarin (Williams et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The presence of this novel binding pocket suggests CYP2C9 may binds multiple ligands and undergo allosteric mechanism during its biological function (Williams et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>These two mutations are significantly highly frequent in Caucasian populations than in African and Asian populations (Sistonen et al., 2009, Van Booven et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>When treated with anti-coagulant warfarin, the patients with these two mutations have prolonged clotting time as well as an elevated possibility of severe bleeding complications (Aithal et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>In treatment with the hypoglycemic agent, glipizide and tolbutamide, these patients (with Arg144Cys, rs1799853 and Iso359Leu, rs1057910 mutations) may develop very low blood glucose levels (Kidd et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these individuals develop symptoms of phenytoin overdose when treated with it (Ninomiya et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>2000), since they are poor metabolizers of these drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, recently, it has been reported that patients taking long-term oral anti-coagulants treatment with Vitamin K antagonists are at a high risk of thrombotic and/or major hemorrhage adverse events if they are carriers of one of three polymorphisms (Misasi et al., 2016), and the (Iso359Leu rs1057910) is one of them (Misasi et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Sulphonylureas bind the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>This binding closes the potassium channel and open the calcium channel which results in insulin secretion from pancreatic Beta cells (Rendell, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Sulphonylureas are metabolized by CYP2C9 in hepatocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CYP2C9 gene variations might be associated with risk of diabetes and/or altered drug reaction to the Sulphonylureas (Pollastro et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>The Cytochrome P450 2C19 is encoded by chromosome 10, and is expressed in the human liver (Uehara et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>It is the most polymorphic member of CYP2 C subfamily (Lee, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>It catalyzes the metabolism of drugs for example the S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, in addition to some of antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Reynald et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphism in CYP2C19 results in inter-individual differences in the enzyme expression and in metabolic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The Allelic variation (gene polymorphism) classified the population according to the catalytic activity of CYP2C19 to poor, extensive and ultra-rapid phenotypes for drug clearance (Reynald et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>For instance, the individuals who are carriers of the loss-of-function alleles of CYP2C19 have shown to have a decreased antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel as well as lower blood concentrations of the active form of clopidogrel (Brandt et al., 2007; Simon et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>This is since the clopidogrel (pro-drug) should be sufficiently metabolized by the CYP2C19 such that it is converted to an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation (Dean, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>It is therefore, the patients that are homozygous for the CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles develop adverse clinical reactions when treated with clopidogrel after acute myocardial infarction (Simon et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the individuals that are ultrarapid metabolizers with the CYP2C19*17 allele can exhibit a good therapeutic response that is associated with an increased effect of clopidogrel and probably an increased bleeding risk (Sibbing et al., 2010, Tiroch et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been reported the SNP (168946C&gt;T) in exon 9 of CYP2C19 gene would lead to change in arginine 442 to cysteine (Morita et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>This change from a positively-charged amino acid arginine 442 to the sulphur-containing amino acid cysteine is located proximal to the CYP2C19 heme binding region (Figure 1 D) and reduces it catalytic activity (Morita et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of CYP2C19 complexed with the inhibitor inhibitor (2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-(4- hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl) methanone was to 2.87 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography(Reynald, Sansen et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>The 3D structure of CYP2C19 is highly similar to that of CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>However, its binding pockets are completely different in term of topography, polarity and hydrophobicity since the amino acid residues are divergent in this region which may explain why these enzymes exhibit different substrate/inhibitor specificities (Reynald et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of the CYP1B1 was determined (Wang et al., 2011), it has a narrow slot-like active site that is similar to that of CYP1A1, however, the residues around the edge of the active sites are different for specific binding of substrates and inhibitors (Wang et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Using the reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR, CYP1B1 mRNA was detected in hepatocytes, lymphocytes, and uterus (Hakkola et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>CYP1B1 gene is expressed in different amounts among tissues, the highest mRNA expression levels were found in extrahepatic tissues such as renal, uterine, heart, brain, lung, skeletal muscle (Pavek and Dvorak, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>CYP1B1 is highly expressed in estrogen related organ such as uterus, ovaries and mammary glands (Tsuchiya et al, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>The CYP1B1 catalyzes the metabolism of endogenous substrates such as 17 β-estradiol into reactive metabolites, such as 4-hydroxyestradiol (Smerdova et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>The 4-hydroxyestradiol, a catechol metabolite reduces the activity of estrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>However, it generates free radicals from the reductive-oxidative cycling with the corresponding quinone and semiquinone forms, which cause cellular damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 4-hydroxyestradiol is toxicologically active and may have a role in induction of cancer (Bolton and Thatcher, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>The 4-hydroxyestradiol level is elevated in human uterine and breast cancers in comparison to normal tissue (Bolton and Thatcher, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>Mutations in CYP1B1 were reported to be causes of disease phenotype such as the primary congenital glaucoma (Badeeb et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CYP1B1 gene polymorphisms L432V and A119S (rs1056827) were reported to be risk of developing endometrial (Zhu et al., 2011), laryngeal cancers and T2D (Yu et al., 2015; Elfaki et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>CYP1A2 is primarily expressed in hepatocytes and is about 13% of all CYP 450s in liver (Ren et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>About 5% of currently used drugs are metabolized by CYP1A2 (Zhou et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Drug substrates of CYP1A2 include acetaminophen, paracetamol, theophylline, propranolol, lidocaine, tacrine and triamterene (Vasanthanathan et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>Endogenous substrates of CYP1A2 are steroids, retinols, melatonin, uroporphyrinogen, and arachidonic acids (Zhou et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>CYP1A2 is also able to activate procarcinogens (Ayari et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>Examples of CYP1A2 inducers include tobacco, flutamide, and caffeine (Wang et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure reveal the CYP1A2 folds as the general CYP structure into 4 Beta sheets designated from 1-4, and 12 alpha helices designated from A-L, in addition to several other alpha helices designated by prime or double prime (Sansen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>The substrate binding pocket of CYP1A2 is narrow, compact and closed to fit binding and oxidation of relatively large and planar substrates such as PAHs (Sansen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that there is a SNP C&gt;A (rs762551) in intron 1 of CYP1A2 with AA homozygote carriers metabolize the caffeine at highest rate (Womack et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism influences the inducibility of CYP1A2 particularly in smokers (Koonrungsesomboon et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>The highest CYP1A2 induction rate was reported in AA genotype and no difference between AC and CC genotypes (Sachse et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>It was postulated that the differences in CYP1A2 expression levels are due altered regulatory proteins binding or due to linkage disequilibrium with other mutations influencing inducibility of CYP1A2 (Cornelis et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>It was reported that carriers of CYP1A2 with high activity were at more risk to lung cancer (Seow et al., 2001; Bu, et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>2014), confirming the role of CYP1A2 in activating heterocyclic arylamines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Cornelis et al reported that individuals had low inducibility CYP1A2 were more susceptible to myocardial infarction (MI) than those had high inducibility CYP1A2 (Cornelis et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that this increased susceptibility was because MI patients who had low inducibility CYP1A2 had increased cytokines levels (Cornelis et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease is well-established (Tousoulis et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>CYP1A2 also metabolizes 17β-estradiol to 2-hydroxyestradiol which is then converted to 2-methoxyestradiol by catechol-O-methyltransferase (Ren et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>The 2-methoxyestradiol inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells proliferation by inducing apoptosis (Ren et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that CYP1A2 downregualtion would result in progression of HCC. </plain></SENT>
