Characterization of the environment composition broadens the knowledge about the relationship between species composition and environmental conditions. An important element of extracting the knowledge of the sample composition is to compare the extracted fragments of DNA with sequences derived from known organisms. In the presented paper, we introduce an algorithm called CoMeta (<underline>C</underline>lassification <underline>o</underline>f <underline>meta</underline>genomes), which assigns a query read (a DNA fragment) into one of the groups previously prepared by the user. Typically, this is one of the taxonomic rank (e.g., phylum, genus), however prepared groups may contain sequences having various functions. In CoMeta, we used the exact method for read classification using short subsequences (<italic>k</italic>-mers) and fast program for indexing large set of <italic>k</italic>-mers. In contrast to the most popular methods based on BLAST, where the query is compared with each reference sequence, we begin the classification from the top of the taxonomy tree to reduce the number of comparisons. The presented experimental study confirms that CoMeta outperforms other programs used in this context.

Its origins can be found in the work of Pace <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], in which the first proposal for cloning the environmental DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences was formulated. In metagenomics, the isolation and culture of organisms is unnecessary. Therefore, it is possible to investigate the species that previously have been usually neglected due to the lack of laboratory-grown cultures. Moreover, a large number of unknown enzymes and metabolic capabilities are encoded in the genomes of uncultured species. Ultimately, metagenomics allows for discovering thousands of new microorganisms and their potentially useful functions [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Metagenomic analyzes can help in solving numerous practical challenges in medicine, engineering, agriculture, and ecology [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, many projects are carried out which are aimed at understanding biocenosis coming from various environments, such as soil [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], water (i.e., groundwater [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], seawater [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], rivers [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), or places with extreme conditions, like hot springs and mud holes in solfataric fields [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], glacier ice [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or Antarctic desert soil [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The probes are also collected from other organisms, for example from rumens of buffalo [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or cow [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The fact that human organism carries a hundred times more bacterial genes than our inherited human genome was the main reason for growing interests in the microorganisms living in the human body [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The main aim of the Human Microbiome Project [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], started in 2009, lies in characterizing the human microbiome communities found at several different sites in the human body, including nasal passages, oral cavities, skin, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts. Furthermore, the project is aimed at analyzing the role of these microbes in human health and disease.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Metagenomic processing</title><p>The metagenomic analysis is a multi-stage process [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, the genetic material is isolated from the environmental sample containing a mixture of various types of microorganisms. Subsequently, the DNA material is extracted and sequenced. Finally, the reads (short fragments of genomes obtained in sequencing) are binned and annotated.</p><p>In the recent decade, the DNA sequencing methods were becoming cheaper and faster. The first method for sequencing was invented by Sanger [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in 1977, and it dominated for almost two subsequent decades. In spite of many improvements proposed to this technique, it is inferior to the recent methods, referred to as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most popular among them are the 454/Roche and Illumina/Solexa systems, and nowadays they are extensively applied to the analysis of metagenomic samples [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, the 454 sequencing has been used to study the metagenomes contained in kefir grains [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], waste water [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas the sequences of infant gut [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or Cystic Fibrosis Lungs [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] metagenomes have been sequenced with Illumina. In a single experiment, the 454/Roche sequencers produce millions of long reads (600&#x02013;900 bp), while the Illumina/Solexa sequencers deliver hundreds of millions of shorter reads (36&#x02013;200 bp).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Classification of metagenomic data</title><p>The sequencing results in obtaining a huge set of reads coming from the genomes of organisms living in the investigated environment. As it was mentioned earlier, an important aim of the metagenomic study is to determine qualitative and quantitative composition of the environmental sample, which is achieved by solving two important tasks, namely binning and annotation. The latter requires classification of the reads to a set of known sequences. The reads may be compared with annotated sequences stored in a number of databases (e.g., GenBank [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and associated with a species or a gene function. In general, the questions raised are: &#x0201c;who is there?&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;how much of each?&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;what are they doing?&#x0201d;. The answers to the first two questions may be obtained relying on taxonomic classification, while the third one can be answered using functional classification.</p><p>During the study of the environmental community, the obtained reads derived from a set of various organisms are assigned to taxa. The assignment may be either independent or dependent on the taxonomy. In the latter case, the reads are directly assigned to taxa on the basis of the reference sequences, where the taxon can range from the superkingdom to the species rank. During the taxonomy independent analysis, the reads are grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on their similarity to each other in the sample. OTU is usually delineated with a 3% sequence dissimilarity, which corresponds to the taxonomical rank of species [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Obviously, the acceptance threshold may be set to a different value [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Using the taxonomy dependent analysis, OTUs can be assigned to taxonomic names. In a single habitat, the organisms belonging to various groups appear together. Even though a microbial probe contains microbial eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and also viruses, the metagenomic study is primarily focused on the prokaryotic species. Moreover, sequencing of eukaryotic DNA is unprofitable due to the large genome size and low gene coding densities. Therefore, in some studies, the eukaryotic cells are eliminated by filtering the samples [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There are several computer programs for read-to-taxa classification. They can be separated into two main groups, namely composition-based and similarity search methods. Using the former, reference sequence features are first extracted and subsequently compared, whilst using the latter, the reads are compared to some reference sequences. The hybrids of these two approaches may also include elements of phylogenetic analysis.</p><p>The composition-based methods follow the three-stage strategy [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]: 1) machine learning-based modeling of features extracted from reference sequences (e.g., distribution of short nucleotide subsequences, <italic>k</italic>-mers); 2) modeling of the unknown set of reads (performed in the same way as for the set of reference sequences); 3) comparison of the reads and reference sequences models to assign taxonomic ranks for each read. Among the machine learning methods, it is worth to mention the interpolated Markov models [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], support vector machines (SVMs) [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121453.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or naive Bayesian classifier [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For SVMs, training from large datasets may be problematic, however the training set can be effectively selected using various techniques [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The similarity search methods rely on the sequence homology. They use a database, containing nucleotide or protein reference sequences. For detecting remote homologies, it is better to use the protein sequences, as they are more well-conserved across greater evolutionary distances. However, in order to use the protein database, the reads have to be translated into amino acid sequences. Taking into account all three possible start sites of encoding amino acids on the both strands (the main sequence and its reverse-complement counterpart), each read has to be translated in all six reading frames, which negatively influences the computation time. In addition, the reads with non-coding DNA cannot be processed by such translation-to-protein method.</p><p>In most cases, the similarity search methods employ BLAST to obtain alignments of reads to a reference sequences set. Subsequently, these alignments are used for taxonomic classification. Some programs, like MEGAN [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], MTR [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], SOrt-ITEMS [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], CARMA3 [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], use the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm for assigning the taxonomic labels. After performing the BLAST search for each read, the BLAST hits, whose bit scores are above the threshold, are selected for further analysis. LCA is computed for all species that were reported by best BLAST hits for a read. If BLAST hits are ambiguous (the hits are similar for reference sequences derived from different species), then the read is assigned to a higher taxonomic level.</p><p>Furthermore, the marker genes can also be used to facilitate reads classification. These genes help to identify a particular species, e.g., 16S rRNA occurs in the prokaryote genomes. MG-RAST [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] relies on the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and ACLAME (including mobile genetic elements) databases. MetaPhyler [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] uses 31 phylogenetic marker genes as the taxonomic references. One of CARMA3 variants [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Treephyler [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] use hidden Markov models (instead of BLAST) to search for the homologies against the Pfam database&#x02014;protein domains contained in the Pfam are here used as the markers.</p><p>As discussed earlier, the composition-based classification methods compare the <italic>k</italic>-mer distribution of a read with those which come from different taxa. In the FACS [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] program, instead of determining the full distribution of <italic>k</italic>-mers, their appearance in a reference sequence is taken into account (1 if a <italic>k</italic>-mer from a read appears in a reference sequence, 0 otherwise). FACS can be regarded as a similar search method, because it aligns the reads to the reference sequences, represented by <italic>k</italic>-mers indexed using the Bloom filters. The original FACS algorithm was implemented in the Perl language, but the latest version has been reimplemented in C (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SciLifeLab/facs">https://github.com/SciLifeLab/facs</ext-link>). Actually, the new version is not intended for metagenomic data classification, but it checks how many reads might be contaminated in a particular sample.</p><p>The Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT) also maps <italic>k</italic>-mers without using information about their positions and quantity [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. When constructing a <italic>k</italic>-mer database, each canonical <italic>k</italic>-mer (i.e., the <italic>k</italic>-mer or its reverse complement, if the latter is lexicographically smaller), derived from the reference sequence, is assigned to a group of reference sequences which contain that <italic>k</italic>-mer. Hence, the <italic>k</italic>-mers are grouped together in such a way that each group contains those <italic>k</italic>-mers which occur in every reference sequence in the group and does not occur in any sequence outside the group. LMAT, like the programs discussed earlier, also computes the LCA&#x02014;the created groups are linked together in a taxonomic tree. During classification, the canonical <italic>k</italic>-mers of each read are compared to the <italic>k</italic>-mers located in every group. The similarity score is increased for each matching <italic>k</italic>-mer, and cumulated for the whole taxon. Similarly to other LCA-employing methods, in case of conflicts (i.e., situations, in which the scores for several taxa are high and identical) the read is classified to the level above. This helps in selecting the most specific taxonomic label, whose lineage has no conflicts with another taxonomic label.</p><p>Very recently, the Kraken algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] using the <italic>k</italic>-mer indexing scheme similar to LMAT, has been proposed. These methods differ, however, in classification and database construction strategy. In the algorithm used in Kraken, each <italic>k</italic>-mer from a reference sequence stores the taxonomic ID number of the <italic>k</italic>-mers&#x02019; LCA values. Like in LMAT, the Kraken database contains the <italic>k</italic>-mers in the canonical representation. However, these <italic>k</italic>-mers are first sorted according to the minimizer, a very popular idea in recent years in bioinformatics [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], (i.e., the lexicographically smallest <italic>M</italic>-mer in each <italic>k</italic>-mer), and the <italic>k</italic>-mers containing the same minimizer are sorted in the lexicographical order in the database. This strategy substantially accelerates the queries. A taxonomic node cumulates points for every match of a <italic>k</italic>-mer extracted from the given read. The read is classified to the node, which has obtained the largest number of points cumulated along the path leading from the root to that node.</p><p>Both LMAT and Kraken do not use the cumulative distribution of <italic>k</italic>-mers and also they do not exploit the alignment searching. Thus, they can be regarded as the hybrid methods, combining two different strategies&#x02014;the composition-based and similarity search approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Contribution</title><p>In this paper, we present CoMeta&#x02014;a new fast and accurate algorithm for <underline>c</underline>lassification <underline>o</underline>
<underline>meta</underline>genomes (metagenomic reads). We determine the similarity (termed the match score) between the query read and a group of the reference sequences by counting the number of nucleotides in those <italic>k</italic>-mers, which occur both in the read and in the group. The read is classified to that group, for which the match score is the largest. The group is defined as a set of sequences of specific attribution. Typically, this is one of the taxonomic ranks (e.g., phylum, genus). CoMeta employs an efficient <italic>k</italic>-mer counting and indexing algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Its low memory requirements allows us to create the indexes even at high taxonomy tree levels that embrace large groups of sequences. In this way, after having built the indexes, we can quickly search the tree from the root to the leaves, and find the closest match for a given query read. This classification scheme (i.e., analysis of the taxonomy tree from the top) is in contrast to the existing BLAST-based methods, which require the query read be compared with every reference sequence.</p><p>The main idea of the proposed method is similar to the one used in FACS. However, CoMeta does not impose any restrictions on the size of the data. We are able to classify sequences derived from both bacteria and big eukaryotes. The details of our algorithm are given in Section Methods. Extensive experimental study, whose results are reported in Section Results and Discussion, confirms that our algorithm is competitive, offering high speed and accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the following description of our algorithm, several symbols will be used.

Firstly (in the <italic>database construction</italic> stage), the indexed <italic>k</italic>-mer databases of clustered reference sequences are constructed. Subsequently (in the <italic>classification</italic> stage), the reads are classified to various groups with the use of the databases. The second stage is composed of two steps.

The reference sequences and reads contain sometimes the unknown nucleotides (Ns). The <italic>k</italic>-mers with such symbols are skipped.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Database construction</title><p>Before classification, the reference sequences have to be grouped into <italic>n</italic> categories, with whom we want to compare the metagenomic data. For example, the sequences can be grouped according to a phylum, so that a single group contains all the reference sequences belonging to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Thermotogae, etc.</p><p>In order to classify the reads into a taxon, the nucleotide sequence database (nt data with entries from all traditional divisions of GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ) has to be downloaded from the NCBI website. After that, the <italic>tax</italic> number (Taxonomic Identification ID) should be added to each reference sequence using the <italic>gi</italic> number (Sequence Identification ID). The <italic>tax</italic> number is necessary to categorize the sequences into groups. Hence, <italic>gi_taxid_nucl.dmp</italic> file, which contains the links between the <italic>gi</italic> and <italic>tax</italic> number, should also be downloaded from the NCBI website. This file is of a huge size, therefore we created an auxiliary program to avoid loading the entire file into RAM. This program splits the input file into smaller ones, then each of them is read sequentially, and finally the program extracts information about the <italic>tax</italic> number. Detailed support on how to prepare the data is given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jkawulok/CoMeta/blob/master/readme.txt">readme.txt</ext-link> file in the CoMeta package.</p><p>The <italic>k</italic>-mer database <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for each group <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is created using a parallel disk-based algorithm, which we derived from our earlier <italic>k</italic>-mer counting software [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. First, every reference sequence from the group is scanned symbol by symbol to extract all <italic>k</italic>-mers. Subsequently, the <italic>k</italic>-mers are collected and sorted lexicographically. This makes it possible to create the set of all <italic>k</italic>-mers, occurring at least once in the reference sequences (after sorting, the repeating <italic>k</italic>-mers are at adjacent positions, so we can store only a single copy of each one).</p><p>The database is stored to the disk in a compact way (compact database). Each nucleotide is encoded using 2 bits. Instead of writing whole <italic>k</italic>-mers to the file, the <italic>k</italic>-mers sharing a common prefix are broken down into two parts, i.e., a four-nucleotide prefix and a suffix, thus, each suffix is saved on 2(<italic>k</italic>&#x02212;4) bits. The prefix is written once, and it is followed by a list of the suffixes with the number of each occurrences.</p><p>For classification purposes, CoMeta uses mainly two lists: 1) a buffer that contains sorted suffixes (stored on 1 byte) after cutting off eight-nucleotide prefix; 2) a list of 65,536 (= 4<sup>8</sup>) elements of information, where the list of suffix for each prefix begins. These lists are built at the beginning of the classification process. However, in order to accelerate the loading of the database during the classification (which is crucial if the same database is used many times), compact database can be converted into a bit larger file (non-compact database), which contains among others the two lists. This file is loaded into the program once, and the size of this file is equal to the size of the memory that the <italic>k</italic>-mer database occupies during the classification.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Classification</title><p>As it was mentioned earlier, the classification of the reads at a single level <italic>j</italic> (e.g., the order) consists of two steps: comparison and assignment. In the following subsections on the taxonomic classification, these steps are described for the <italic>j</italic>-th taxonomic rank. In order to avoid obfuscating the notation, the upper index <italic>j</italic> is omitted.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Comparison step</title><p>In the comparison step, the set of reads <italic>M</italic> is compared with all <italic>n</italic>
<italic>k</italic>-mer databases that have been created beforehand. Each database <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is loaded into RAM. When comparing each read from <italic>M</italic> against <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> group (1 &#x02264; <italic>i</italic> &#x02264; <italic>n</italic>), the match score (<italic>&#x003be;</italic>) is obtained by cumulating the similarity between the <italic>k</italic>-mers extracted from the read and from the reference sequences in <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. For a given read <italic>R</italic>, the successive <italic>k</italic>-mers are obtained using the 1-base sliding window. All possible subsequent <italic>k</italic>-mers from <italic>R</italic> are checked for occurrence in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. For each <italic>j</italic>-th <italic>k</italic>-mer of <italic>R</italic> found in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the match score <italic>&#x003be;</italic> is increased by <italic>&#x003be;</italic>
<sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, which is the number of bases in the <italic>k</italic>-mer that have not yet contributed to the match score (i.e., <inline-formula id="pone.0121453.e010"><mml:math id="M10"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003be;</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">b</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pone.0121453.e011"><mml:math id="M11"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">b</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of overlapping bases between the <italic>j</italic>-th <italic>k</italic>-mer and the previous <italic>k</italic>-mer found in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). Due to the 1-base sliding window, two subsequent read <italic>k</italic>-mers have <italic>k</italic>&#x02212;1 overlapping bases, and our intention is to prevent from increasing the match score too much, if both exist in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. The number of the overlapping bases between the <italic>p</italic>-th and <italic>q</italic>-th <italic>k</italic>-mers (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; <italic>q</italic>) is <inline-formula id="pone.0121453.e012"><mml:math id="M12"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="fraktur">b</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>max</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>. An example on how the match score is calculated is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0121453.g003">Fig 3</xref> for <italic>k</italic> = 5. For simplicity, we assume that <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> group contains only one reference sequence, <italic>S</italic>. In the &#x0201c;<italic>k</italic>-mers&#x0201d; column, the <italic>k</italic>-mers that occur in the query read are sequentially listed. Those <italic>k</italic>-mers, which are found in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> database, are marked in bold (a sorted list of the <italic>k</italic>-mers from <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> group is shown in the left part of the figure). The final match score for the sample read is 12, and the match rate score (&#x0039e;), which is percentage ratio of the match score to the read length, is 85.7% (&#x0039e; = 12/14&#x022c5;100%). For better illustration, the sequence matching is also shown at the top of the figure.</p><fig id="pone.0121453.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0121453.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>An example of comparing the query read with the reference sequence.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0121453.g003"/></fig><p>In order to quickly decide whether a read can obtain a significant score for each group <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, we perform simple filtering. We use the <italic>k</italic>&#x02032;-base offset sliding window to scan the query read (1 &#x0003c; <italic>k</italic>&#x02032; &#x02264; <italic>k</italic>, for <italic>k</italic>&#x02032; = 1 this step is skipped). If none of such <italic>k</italic>-mers exist in <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> we resign from scoring it according to <italic>D</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. <italic>R</italic> is pre-assigned to the <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> group, if it (or its reverse complement) accumulates a match rate score exceeding a chosen match cut-off value (<italic>MC</italic>). After the comparisons, for each group, we obtain two output files with the preliminary assignments, namely: 1) the <italic>match</italic> file that contains the reads, which accumulated a sufficient match rate score (&#x0039e; &#x02265; <italic>MC</italic>), and 2) the <italic>mismatch</italic> file which contains the remaining reads. Thus, 2<italic>n</italic> output intermediary assignment files are obtained after the first step of the classification. These files do not contain the nucleotide sequences, but only the single-line description of each read in the FASTA format, along with the obtained match scores. The corresponding nucleotide sequences are added after completing the classification stage.</p><p>The idea of this step is similar as used in the FACS algorithm. However, in FACS, the Bloom filters, which are of a limited capacity, are used to store the <italic>k</italic>-mers. For each reference sequence, a separate Bloom filter is created. In addition, long sequences (&#x02273; 200 Mbp) have to be split into a few subsequences, and then Bloom filters are created separately for each of them. Furthermore, usage of the Bloom filters may result in obtaining false <italic>k</italic>-mer positives. In FACS (the Perl implementation), the reads which have been classified as belonging to some reference sequence, are withdrawn from further querying (the sequences are analyzed in some arbitrary order). This approach may result in classifying the read to an incorrect reference, if its match score is over the cut-off value for more than a single reference sequence, but the correct one does not appear as the first one.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Assignment to the best group</title><p>The second step of the classification stage consists in the analysis of the intermediary assignment files, and the query read is classified to that group, for which the match score (<italic>&#x003be;</italic>) is the highest. When multiple groups obtain the same highest match score, the read could be assigned to: 1) all of these groups; 2) any group; 3) random group.</p><p>To increase the sensitiveness of our method, in this step not only <italic>match</italic> but also <italic>mismatch</italic> files can be used. Using the latter, larger percentage of reads are classified, but in some cases this is achieved at the expense of precision. When taking into the account the <italic>mismatch</italic> file, the read is classified to a group with the highest match, even if it is below <italic>MC</italic>. However, this matching must contain at least one matching <italic>k</italic>-mer (<italic>&#x003be;</italic> &#x02265; <italic>k</italic>).</p><p>After this step, the classification is completed for a single taxonomic rank, and <italic>f</italic>+1 output files (<italic>F</italic>) are obtained. Apart from the classified reads, those reads which have not been assigned to any group, are stored in the additional <italic>F</italic>
<sub><italic>nc</italic></sub> file. The number <italic>f</italic> is equal to the number of groups, to which the reads from <italic>M</italic> were classified. For the groups without any reads preassigned, the files are not generated at all (hence, <italic>f</italic> &#x02264; <italic>n</italic>).</p><p>For classification to a lower rank, classification stage has to be repeated, which is described in the following subsection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Taxonomy tree-based classification</title><p>Our taxonomic classification method starts from some high taxonomic rank, and then, if necessary, classifies reads to the lower levels.

<italic>FACS-P</italic>, <italic>FACS-C</italic>, and <italic>pre-CoMeta</italic> were ran using various values of <italic>k</italic> and <italic>MC</italic>.

The databases used by MetaPhyler, MG-RAST, LMAT <italic>kML</italic>, as well as CoMeta <italic>micDb</italic> do not contain human sequences, or contain only specific marker genes, so it is understandable that the results are rather poor. Although the databases in CARMA and MEGAN contain human sequences, the results obtained on these metagenomic datasets were also poor. To investigate this problem, we tried to align a few reads from this dataset using BLASTX (both programs employ it), and BLASTX failed to classify some reads, which explains weak results for CARMA and MEGAN. LMAT <italic>kML</italic> classified incorrectly fewer reads than CoMeta <italic>micDb</italic>, but also fewer reads were classified correctly, hence the total number of classified reads was smaller for LMAT than for CoMeta.</p><p>For three other datasets, the results of MetaPhyler, MG-RAST, CARMA, and MEGAN were better than those achieved for <italic>FACS 269 bp</italic>, however, LMAT, CoMeta, and Kraken were able to classify more reads. MetaPhyler is very fast since it uses only the &#x0201c;marker genes&#x0201d;, however only reads having them are correctly classified. Thus, this algorithm performs well only for the dataset created by the program&#x02019;s authors. During DNA sequencing, only a certain percentage of reads have the marker genes, therefore in many cases MetaPhyler does not recognize correctly the origin of the reads. The best results for the <italic>MetaPhyler 300 bp</italic> dataset were obtained by Kraken and CoMeta, which outperformed LMAT. For the <italic>CARMA 265 bp</italic> dataset the winner was CoMeta. Kraken returned slightly worse scores, and LMAT&#x02014;much worse. However, for the <italic>PhyloPythia 961 bp</italic> dataset, it was LMAT <italic>kML</italic>, which achieved the best score. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the results of LMAT <italic>kFull</italic> was significantly worse (comparing only those three programs), whereas for the remaining datasets the classification results were better using <italic>kFull</italic> than using <italic>kML</italic> database.</p><p>
<xref rid="pone.0121453.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the evaluation of CoMeta, LMAT, and Kraken for the Illumina reads. Here we showed results for five classification levels: phylum, class, order, family, and genus. As mentioned earlier, we run Kraken using only the MiniKraken database downloaded from the Kraken website, because we have not managed to build the larger database nor to obtain it Kraken&#x02019;s authors. Therefore, in addition to the results obtained in our experiment, we present also the results quoted from Wood&#x02013;Salzberg&#x02019; paper [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (that work reports the results only for the genus level). Although we carefully followed the instructions when running Kraken, we obtained different results for two datasets using MiniKraken database, compared with those reported in [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The precision values were similar, but the difference in sensitivity was greater. For the <italic>HiSeq 92 bp</italic> dataset, we obtained the sensitivity 1.58% smaller than reported in [<xref rid="pone.0121453.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and for the <italic>MiSeq 156 bp</italic> dataset it was 4% higher. The differences in precision could be due to the fact that Kraken&#x02019;s authors took into account the reads incorrectly classified to the levels above the analyzed rank, whereas we consider such reads unclassified. However, we cannot explain the cause of the difference in the sensitivity values. The best classification results for both datasets at the genus level were obtained using Kraken-GB. This database, according to its authors, contains GenBanks draft and completed genomes for bacteria and archaea. Taking into account the results obtained in our experiments, the <italic>HiSeq 92 bp</italic> dataset was classified the best by LMAT and by CoMeta. For the <italic>MiSeq 156 bp</italic> dataset, LMAT was better than CoMeta only at the phylum level, while CoMeta correctly classified much more reads at lower levels.</p><p>In <xref rid="pone.0121453.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> we present the classification times and memory usage. It may be seen that the programs which use <italic>k</italic>-mers databases use a lot of memory. Using all available reference sequences (<italic>allDb</italic>), CoMeta consumed about 70 GB of RAM. This was reduced to 20 GB, when taking into account only bacteria, viruses, and archaea (<italic>micDb</italic>). CoMeta <italic>allDb</italic> is by 1.5&#x02013;2 times slower than CoMeta <italic>micDb</italic>. MiniKraken database contains only a fraction of <italic>k</italic>-mers of the reference sequence complete genomes for bacteria, viruses, and archaea; it consumed between 1.5 GB and 4 GB of RAM. When using the complete database without eukaryotes Kraken needs 74 GB (according to the authors).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0121453.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0121453.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Comparison of RAM memory usage and CPU times.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0121453.t005g" xlink:href="pone.0121453.t005"/><table frame="box" rules="all" border="0"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Program</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FACS</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MetaPhyler</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CARMA</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PhyloPythia</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HiSeq</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MiSeq</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">269bp</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">300bp</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">265bp</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">961bp</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92bp</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156bp</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="7" align="left" rowspan="1">CPU Runtime (minutes)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CARMA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t005fn001">

The largest <italic>k</italic>-mer database is for the &#x0201c;Chordata&#x0201d; phylum (up to 73 GB for <italic>k</italic> = 30), however in many metagenomic studies, the eukaryotes are not investigated at all. For bacteria, the Proteobacteria <italic>k</italic>-mer database is the largest one (almost 20 GB of RAM is necessary).</p><p>The dependence of the database size on the number of unique <italic>k</italic>-mers (which appeared at least once in the <italic>G</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> group) is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0121453.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>. Approximately, the relationship between <italic>k</italic> and the database size is linear. The size of the non-compact database is approximately equal to the compact one for <italic>k</italic> = 30.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Conclusions and future work</title><p>In this paper, we proposed a new method for classification of reads to the taxonomic rank. First, the groups of reference sequences (each derived from a single taxon) are divided into overlapping <italic>k</italic>-mers (short substrings), from which the databases are built. Each database is subsequently used for checking the similarity between the query read and the group, which this database represents. We proceed the read classification from the root towards the leaves of the taxonomical tree, which accelerates the program execution, since the read does not have to be compared with each reference sequence. The presented experimental results proved our approach to be competitive and outperforming many alternative popular programs. The results also indicate how important it is to properly select the length of <italic>k</italic>-mers. For too small <italic>k</italic>&#x02019;s, too many reads are misclassified, while too large <italic>k</italic>&#x02019;s increase the number of unclassified reads. The downside of our method is that it needs a lot of RAM, when large <italic>k</italic>-mer databases are used. For classification at the phylum level, using the largest set of <italic>k</italic>-mers for Proteobacteria, about 20 GB are required. CoMeta is slower than the very recently published Kraken program. However, CoMeta returns information about all the groups to which the query read was classified if it was classified to several ones, (when the conflict occurred), and not like Kraken and LCAT which cut off the branch and classify the read to a higher level.</p><p>Our ongoing research includes examining the influence of the length of the reference sequences (derived from one group) on the best value of the <italic>k</italic> parameter, so that it can be selected automatically. Furthermore, we intend to take into consideration not only the number of matched nucleotides (match scores), but also the number of deletions and insertions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121453.s001"><label>S1 Supporting Information</label><caption><title>Additional tables and figures of the experiments results.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121453.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0121453.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
